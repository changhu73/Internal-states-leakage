What was most remarkable about the energetic and at times heated discussion that followed Stepto\u2019s and Walker\u2019s remarks was the assumption of everyone in that room that Their Eyes was a shared text, that a novel that just ten years earlier was unknown and unavailable had entered into critical acceptance as perhaps the most widely known and the most privileged text in the African-American literary canon. That MLA session was important for another reason. Walker\u2019s defense of Janie\u2019s choice (actually Hurston\u2019s choice) to be silent in the crucial places in the novel turned out to be the earliest feminist reading of voice in Their Eyes, a reading that was later supported by many other Hurston scholars.

On the way home, Jem said he had to do it just for a month and the month was up and it wasn't fair. \"Just one more week, son,\" said Atticus. \"No,\" said Jem. \"Yes,\" said Atticus.

With one phrase he had turned happy picknickers into a sulky, tense, murmuring crowd, being slowly hypnotized by gavel taps lessening in intensity until the only sound in the courtroom was a dim pink-pink-pink: the judge might have been rapping the bench with a pencil. In possession of his court once more, Judge Taylor leaned back in his chair. He looked suddenly weary; his age was showing, and I thought about what Atticus had said- he and Mrs. Taylor didn't kiss much- he must have been nearly seventy. \"There has been a request,\" Judge Taylor said, \"that this courtroom be cleared of spectators, or at least of women and children, a request that will be denied for the time being. People generally see what they look for, and hear what they listen for, and they have the right to subject their children to it, but I can assure you of one thing: you will receive what you see and hear in silence or you will leave this courtroom, but",

Do you have anything to add to it? Do you agree with the sheriff?\" \"I holds with Tate. Her eye was blacked and she was mighty beat up.\" The little man seemed to have forgotten his previous humiliation from the bench. It was becoming evident that he thought Atticus an easy match. He seemed to grow ruddy again; his chest swelled, and once more he was a red little rooster. I thought he'd burst his shirt at Atticus's next question: \"Mr. Ewell, can you read and write?\" Mr. Gilmer interrupted. \"Objection",

Miss Maudie had once let me see it: among other things, the recipe called for one large cup of sugar. It was a still day. The air was so cold and clear we heard the courthouse clock clank, rattle and strain before it struck the hour.

I waited until it was time to worry and listened for Mr. Radley's shotgun. Then I thought I heard the back fence squeak. It was wishful thinking. Then I heard Atticus cough. I held my breath. Sometimes when we made a midnight pilgrimage to the bathroom we would find him reading. He said he often woke up during the night, checked on us, and read himself back to sleep.
