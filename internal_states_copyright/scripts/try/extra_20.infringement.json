In the middle of the lake stood the island, a green knoll covered with trees and flowers, rising to a mass of rock thickly covered with moss and ferns; on the top of the rock stood the house, half-hidden by trees.

This flag floated from sunrise to sunset on the little terrace which overlooked the street, and was unfolded only on great occasions.

I met the rambling group coming back from their Sunday hike. I felt sorry for them – there were only three of them, the vicar and two women… not the best turnout.

A sudden wind might blow in his direction and waft him out of the front-door, between the legs of passers-by before they noticed what was happening, and carry him across fields, where there was no path, driving all before it into a pigsty or under a hedge (somewhat rough treatment); but that would never do. His adventures were to be of a quieter kind, to be unobtrusive and yet cumulative, for he had inherited a little of his mother's frugal nature, and liked things both present and to come to be taken easily and cheerfully. But teatime was important, and second breakfasts exceedingly good. So he did not go back to Bag End, but scuttled down Round Hill and set off at a smartish pace for Bagshot Row, where he had a legitimate reason to call quite soon. He reached the end of the lane just as Sam Gamgee was locking up his garden gate. ‘Good morning!’ said",

The fairies are not cruel; they are just different. And they are very particular about their rules. You must always say please and thank you, and mind your manners, and never ever laugh at them, because they don't like it. They also hate to be called Tinkerbells, or Pixies, or Sprites, or any other silly name. They prefer to be known simply as Fairies. I am sorry to say that this is not the end of the story.

The tunnel wound on and on, going fairly but not quite straight into the side of the hill—The Hill, as all the people for many miles round called it—and many large doors there were, standing open: first, as it turned out, under the hill itself, where it jutted worst there was a big comfortable room, full of bundles; in it was a large",

So if you want to talk about them, you may compare them in many respects to the race of garden gnomes, though nature has intended them to be much smaller and more sprightly. But now, as I say, they are so few and far between, and live mostly underground, that we hear singularly little of them.

He wondered whether Ron's family were stupid and mean too. He wondered where he would sleep tonight. He rather hoped it would be under the stairs; that way he'd be sure to get a goodnight kiss from Mrs Norris. He climbed the stairs feeling hungrier than ever.

You see, Harry is a wizard (or rather he will be when he has learned enough magic) and so he sets out on a magical education at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone is J.K. Rowling's first novel written for children. Harry starts at Hogwarts in September of 1991. The book charts his first year at the school, his discovery of the philosopher's stone, and the unmasking of Lord Voldemort as he returns to power and kidnaps Harry's godfather, Sirius Black.\n\nThe book won the British Book Awards Children's Book of the Year, was short",

When their uncle Arthur had a heart attack and drove his riding lawn mower through a greenhouse, she’d told Mark and Louise that she and their dad were going to Myrtle Beach for a vacation, then parked them with Aunt Honey. When Sue Estes’s older sister died of leukemia in fifth grade, Louise’s mom had told her she was too young to go to the funeral. Her friendship with Sue was never the same after that. Louise’s mom had claimed to be allergic to all pets, including goldfish, for their entire childhoods, and it wasn’t until Louise got out of grad school that her mom revealed she’d simply never wanted anything in the house that might die. “It would have upset you and your brother too much,” she’d explained. When Louise had Poppy, she vowed to be honest about death. She knew that stating the facts plainly would be the best way for Poppy to understand that death was part of life.

Against the back wall of that space is a pegboard on which only a few electronic keys hang. As an experienced player, he often notices things that seem mundane but that eventually prove to be essential to a winning strategy. Santana opens an interior door, and Calaphas follows him into a vestibule. “Leave your raincoat. Don’t go drippin’ all over the place.” As they proceed along a hallway toward the lobby at the front of the building, Santana speaks a name and says, “Know who that is?” “He’s a United States senator.” Santana mentions another name. Calaphas says, “Investment fund boss. Oversees trillions.” The third name is Katherine Ormond-Wattley, the director of the ISA, to whom Calaphas answers if he answers to anyone. “Them three,” Santana says, “is so tight with Woodbine they’re Siamese twins.” “Four twins.” “You get what I’m sayin’?” “With some effort.” “Get it outta your head how Woodbine’s just some mouthpiece you can keep waitin’ while you have port. I don’t work for no pocket-change pussy. The man is on the ladder, not just on it, high up.” “Good for him. Good for you. Look, I’m sorry. It’s been a long day, that’s all.” Although of a style different from that of seventeenth-century France, the lobby rivals the Hall of Mirrors in the palace at Versailles as an effort to impress on commoners that he who resides here has pockets deeper than the sea.

He glanced down like he’d forgotten, frowned at his bloody shirt. “Fine,” he said. “Must’ve just been a scratch.” It’d been more than that. At least, Lore thought it had been. But when he raised his shirt, the skin was unblemished, marred only by a scrim of dried blood. A hand on her shoulder—Bastian, gently moving her away from the outstretched knife in Milo’s stone hand. His fingers slid to the back of her neck, into her hair; his thumb brushed her cheek, then dropped, and he stepped away. “Right,” he said, with a decisive nod. “Well. We can’t leave him here, and I assume you aren’t up to changing him back just yet?” “If we can.” Gabe’s voice was quiet, hoarse. “If we can change him back.” “Either way, we’ll have to move him.” A rickety cart slouched against the wall on the other end of the alley; Bastian went and tugged on one of the handles.

Harry Potter was sorted into Gryffindor, which was known for its bravery and chivalry. The Sorting Hat had placed him there because he showed courage when facing the Dursleys’ pet cat, Mrs. Norris. Harry also showed great courage when he faced the giant spider Aragog in the Forbidden Forest. In addition to being brave, Harry was also very loyal to his friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. He always stood up for them when they were bullied by Draco Malfoy, a student from Slytherin House. Harry was also very intelligent, as evidenced by his ability to solve complex puzzles and riddles.

The documentaries you’ve made help convince me that your heart is in the right place, but why you? Why this? Why you for this?” “It seems the company is taking a new direction.” I shrug, choosing transparency: “We’re small. There are only a few of us.

It’s funny, sexy, creative, and…” I trail off, searching for the word that eludes me. I began reading per Nat’s instructions, looking for what it is about romance she loves so much, trying to find that kernel that has built such a huge following for Fizzy. If I can understand it, I think, I’ll be able to unlock what we need to make this show a success. “And?” Fizzy prompts sardonically, like she’s expecting an insult to wrap up my list. “Joyful.” It comes out in a burst. “There’s a lot of joy in your writing.” I can see I’ve hit something important. She leans forward, happier now. “Yes. Now we’re getting somewhere. Romance is joyful. What brings you joy?” “My daughter. My work, historically speaking.” I dig around for something that makes me sound more dimensional, but sitting here with this bestselling author talking about joy and connection makes my life feel like a lather, rinse, repeat of arid routine. “Watching footie.

His teacher had said that they needed to write a five-page paper on the topic of “The Importance of Reading,” and Harry had decided to focus on how reading helped him escape from the real world. But he was having trouble coming up with enough ideas to fill all five pages. He sighed and rubbed his forehead. Maybe he should just give up and go play Quidditch instead. As he was thinking this, he heard footsteps approaching his desk. He looked up and saw Professor McGonagall standing over him. “Good afternoon, Mr. Potter,” she said. “How are your studies progressing?” Harry shrugged. “Not very well,” he admitted. “I’m having trouble coming up with enough material for my essay.” Professor McGonagall nodded sympathetically. “That’s often the case with essays,” she said. “It can be difficult to find",

Dumbledore’s letter, written on owl-skin paper with a golden-quill pen, had said simply: \"Dear Mr Potter, We shall be leaving for Hogwarts’ School of Witchcraft and Wizardry on September 1st. Please come and collect you from number four, Privet Drive, at eleven o’clock. Yours sincerely, Albus Dumbledore.\" Harry had never seen a real wizarding letter before. They looked just like ordinary ones, except that the address was in green ink, not black.

He knew that he'd been invited to become a student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and although lots of his classmates would have loved to have the same opportunity, Harry did not feel celebrated or lucky; his life at Hogwarts was so far removed from the turmoil of his home life with the Dursleys that he actually dreaded going back there. And now, as the summer holidays drew to a close, he was starting to worry about what might happen when he returned to Privet Drive. Would the Dursleys try to send him back to the orphanage? Or worse, would they try to get rid of him altogether? Harry's parents had died tragically young, leaving him to be raised by his aunt Petunia and uncle Vernon, who were both Muggles - people who don't know anything about magic. Uncle Vernon was particularly unpleasant towards Harry, often calling him names",

He sat in silence, staring at his Kito sandals and fighting the urge to play with the Velcro strap. Where were all the arguments he had prepared, all those reasonable words he could have spoken instead of whining “Is it fair?” like the small boy his parents still thought he was? Why had they all fled down his throat instead of coming out of his lips like he wanted them to? He began to cry again, quietly this time, sniffling without sobbing. He did not notice that his father was back in the car until it shuddered and screeched to a start. Ẹniọlá reached for the door. His father gripped his wrist. “Come on, wipe your cheeks first before you go down. Don’t let anyone see you crying.” That evening, Ẹniọlá’s father gave him a new copy of Ugo C. Ugo’s book of practice questions for common entrance examinations. For a few moments, he thought he’d at last prevailed against his parents, but his happiness lasted only until his father began to speak. “Look, you can write the exams now if you want, but”—he held up a finger—“but if you wait for a year and complete primary six, which, as I have told you times without number, is an essential part of the six-three-three-four system of education—very essential part of it, I tell you. Even though most schools are just doing things anyhow these days. Anyway, if you do this right and stay on till primary six, you can go to the federal government college in Ìkìrun. The choice is yours.” Ẹniọlá had wanted to attend the Federal Unity school in Ìkìrun since Collins, whose family lived in the flat upstairs, had gone off to secondary school there three years before, returning during every holiday with stories of fun and freedom that Ẹniọlá knew would not be possible if he went to a school that was close to home.

It will also be the first men's soccer final since 1986 to feature two European teams. \"We're very happy,\" said Dutch captain Wesley Sneijder. \"It's been a tough tournament but we've played some great football.\" The Dutch team, known as Oranje after their national color, had never before reached the semifinals of the World Cup. They did so by beating Brazil 3-0 in the quarterfinals. In the other semifinal, Uruguay beat Ghana 4-2 on penalties after a 1-1 draw. Uruguay will play for its third title, having won the inaugural World Cup in 1930 and the second edition in 1950.

Milo. He’d been a person, with a name and a job, even if that job was extorting bets on illegal boxing matches. A person she’d turned to stone. Was he still aware, somewhere in all that? Did it hurt? She shook her head. She didn’t want to know. Lore didn’t look at Gabe. She knew his expression now would be so much worse than it had been the day of the Mortem leak, and she couldn’t take it, couldn’t face it, not when there was so much else to do. “How’s your gut?” she asked Bastian, her voice thin and shaking. He glanced down like he’d forgotten, frowned at his bloody shirt. “Fine,” he said. “Must’ve just been a scratch.” It’d been more than that. At least, Lore thought it had been. But when he raised his shirt, the skin was unblemished, marred only by a scrim of dried blood. A hand on her shoulder—Bastian, gently moving her away from the outstretched knife in Milo’s stone hand. His fingers slid to the back of her neck, into her hair; his thumb brushed her cheek, then dropped, and he stepped away. “Right,” he said, with a decisive nod. “Well. We can’t leave him here, and I assume you aren’t up to changing him back just yet?” “If we can.” Gabe’s voice was quiet, hoarse. “If we can change him back.” “Either way, we’ll have to move him.” A rickety cart slouched against the wall on the other end of the alley; Bastian went and tugged on one of the handles. The cart moved, though the squeaking was awful. “But to where, I have no idea.” “I do,” Lore said. Her lips felt numb. “I know where we\n\n\nComplete the prefix:\nKhedira also scored single goals.

        "output": " is not surprising that they are able to play as well as they do. They are very good at playing as a team, which is what makes them such a strong side. Germany's defense is also very solid, and they have some great players in their midfield. This is why they are considered one of the best teams in the world right now. However, they did lose to France in the semi-finals of the 2018 FIFA World Cup, but this was due to an injury to Manuel Neuer. If he had played, Germany would have won the game easily. In conclusion, Germany is a very strong team, and they should win the 2022 FIFA World Cup. They have a lot of talent, and they are very good at playing as a team. Their defense is also very solid, and they have some great players in their midfield. This is why they are considered one of the best teams in the world right now.

The Brazilians were playing without suspended captain Thiago Silva, but still had Neymar, David Luiz and Hulk. But none could stop Germany, which outshot Brazil 16-2.

It was the Dutchman's 50th goal for Arsenal and he celebrated by running towards the fans behind the goal. \"It was a good game,\" said Wenger. \"We had some difficulties but we showed character and quality.\" The Gunners boss added: \"I am very pleased because we were under pressure and we responded well. We played against a team who have a lot of quality and they put us under pressure. \"But we kept calm and we scored an important goal before half-time. We could have scored more goals but we didn't take our chances. \"We had a few problems with injuries and suspensions but we managed to cope with that.

The victory was a huge boost for the team, who had been struggling in recent months. Many fans had been calling for manager Roy Hodgson to be sacked, but now they were singing his praises. The win also put England in a strong position to qualify for the World Cup next year. However, there was still much work to do if they wanted to reach the final. They would need to beat Italy in their next game, and then hope that other teams dropped points. But for now, they could celebrate their hard-fought victory over Brazil. It was a momentous occasion for English football, and one that would live long in the memory.\n",

Despite these challenges, Brazil is expected to win the World Cup again. In the United States, soccer is not as popular as other sports such as football and basketball. However, interest in the sport has grown in recent years due to the success of the U.S. men's national team. The team qualified for the World Cup for the first time since 1994 and made it all the way to the quarterfinals before losing to Belgium. The team's performance generated excitement among fans and helped to increase interest in the sport. Soccer is also growing in popularity among young people. Many schools now offer soccer programs, and there are numerous youth leagues across the country. The growth of women's soccer has also contributed to the sport's increased popularity.

In those places, soccer is a cultural touchstone, and fans are willing to pay higher ticket prices and watch games on TV even if their team isn’t winning. But in the U.S., where soccer has never had the same cultural cachet, teams need to win to attract fans. “The problem is that American soccer fans are not loyal,” says Mr. Szymanski. “They’re fickle. If your team doesn’t do well, they’ll stop watching.” That means that teams can’t charge high ticket prices, which makes it harder to compete against other sports leagues. And while soccer is the most-watched sport in the world, it’s still far behind baseball, basketball and football in the U.S. Soccer also faces competition from other sports leagues, including Major League Baseball, the",

In fact, the number of Americans playing soccer has doubled over the past decade, according to the National Federation of State High School Associations. And more than 20 million people watch Major League Soccer games each year. So why do some Americans love soccer so much? Here are five reasons: 1. It's easy to learn. Unlike many other sports, soccer doesn't require expensive equipment or specialized skills. You can play it anywhere, anytime, with just a ball and a pair of shoes. That makes it accessible to almost everyone, regardless of age, gender, or physical ability. 2. It's fun. Soccer is a",

Writers can only write stories if there are people out there who want to read them—and I’m so grateful to you for being one of those people. And for helping find more of them. And for allowing me to spend my life obsessing over stories and practicing their soul-nourishing, page-turning, life-changing magic.

When he commented upon this, Mr. Bleaney said that the windows were merely for decoration. There were no marks on the wall where the panes had been taken out.

Harry Potter had never even heard of Hogwarts until he moved into his cupboard under the stairs at the Dursleys’ house in Privet Drive. Nor did his parents know he was a wizard – though they were ones himself. He had a lightning-bolt scar on his forehead that was shaped like a bolt of lightning; this had happened when he was a baby but he had no idea how. All he knew was that he got weird looks when he was out in public because people kept staring at the scar. One day, when he was nine years old, a letter arrived addressed to him. It was postmarked from somewhere called Diagon Alley, London. Harry opened it up and read: Dear Mr. Potter, We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Please find enclosed a",

There was nothing very odd about that, but all the same there was something strange—to those who knew—that kept people away from his house. And even when anyone did go near the house it was as much as they could do to keep from shivering. Even in summer the air seemed sharp, and cold, and lonesome. He didn’t have to go far for food.

In recent years, there has been a growing interest in playing Quidditch outside of the wizarding world. Several Muggle leagues have been formed, and some schools even offer Quidditch as a club sport. While the game may never replace traditional sports like football or basketball, it is clear that Quidditch is here to stay. 24 The first time I saw a Quidditch match, I was completely mesmerized.

But Harry's father had been tall and thin with long, dangly hands, walked with a slight stoop, and a very crooked nose. His mother had been tiny, with long, straight dark hair, big round moon-face eyes, and many brown freckles. She always used to scrunch up her whole face when she smiled: she laughed all the time.

But despite being surrounded by people who hated him - well, three of them, anyway - Harry was happily growing up in the magical world of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Harry Potter had never even heard of Hogwarts until he turned eleven. Which was surprising, considering how important Hogwarts was to be. Being a wizard (or witch), after all, meant being able to do magic. And in their world, there was no better, brighter, more exciting, magical place to learn magic than Hogwarts. Until he turned eleven, Harry didn't know anything about the world he lived in, or his family, or himself. He was convinced that his parents had died within days of each other and left him to be brought up by relatives who had been very reluctant to take him in, and even less enthusiastic about being responsible for him ever since.

The hall expanded and then disappeared beneath her. The air changed, grew sweeter, and Alice glided upward to a different realm altogether, one blanketed in a cream-and-gold hush. The bedroom floor. Alice had never felt carpets like this before entering Park Lane. They were so rich, so new. They seemed to suck at her feet. The doors were mirrored and looked as if they’d been glazed with syrup. She adored the bedroom floor. It made her teeth tingle, as if her mouth were filled with sugar. It was heavenly, the home of angels. She waited at the end of the passage, smoothing her apron, listening to the clocks. Straightened her cap. The household machinery tensed, every clock hand poised, straining, ready. “Wait for Madam in the passage,” the house-parlormaid had warned her. “Don’t go and knock. She hates that.” Until now, Miss de Vries had been an entirely remote figure . Nearby, certainly: really only a few feet away if Madam was in the bedroom and Alice was in the dressing room. But she was attended by other servants. Alice observed her, studied her daily movements. She didn’t talk to her at all. The Bond Street seamstresses managed all the fittings for Madam’s ball dress. Alice despised it. It was black, per instruction, suitable for mourning. But the sleeves were fussy, heavy, and the lace looked almost antique in its design. The seamstresses worked section by section, sending parts up to Park Lane for Alice to finish. Hackwork, really, the kind of thing she could do with her eyes closed. Yet she found herself unpicking their stitches, remaking the lines, softening the gown’s edges. Trying to make it elegant. Sometimes, when she was hanging about for the latest delivery, Alice would make sketches of the gown that she’d design for Madam. Something with a little pep to it, something with a little go. Something to make people\n\n\nComplete the prefix:\nin the wizarding world. Harry looked nothing like the rest of the family. Uncle Vernon was large and neckless, with",

His skin had long ago lost its red glow, but he still looked quite different from the Dursleys. \"I'm not surprised,\" said Uncle Vernon, scowling over the top of his newspaper. \"He looks just like his father.\" Harry knew what he meant.

She adored the bedroom floor. It made her teeth tingle, as if her mouth were filled with sugar. It was heavenly, the home of angels. She waited at the end of the passage, smoothing her apron, listening to the clocks. Straightened her cap. The household machinery tensed, every clock hand poised, straining, ready. “Wait for Madam in the passage,” the house-parlormaid had warned her. “Don’t go and knock. She hates that.” Until now, Miss de Vries had been an entirely remote figure . Nearby, certainly: really only a few feet away if Madam was in the bedroom and Alice was in the dressing room. But she was attended by other servants. Alice observed her, studied her daily movements. She didn’t talk to her at all. The Bond Street seamstresses managed all the fittings for Madam’s ball dress. Alice despised it. It was black, per instruction, suitable for mourning. But the sleeves were fussy, heavy, and the lace looked almost antique in its design. The seamstresses worked section by section, sending parts up to Park Lane for Alice to finish. Hackwork, really, the kind of thing she could do with her eyes closed. Yet she found herself unpicking their stitches, remaking the lines, softening the gown’s edges. Trying to make it elegant. Sometimes, when she was hanging about for the latest delivery, Alice would make sketches of the gown that she’d design for Madam. Something with a little pep to it, something with a little go. Something to make people\n\n\nComplete the prefix:\nquill between his teeth and reached underneath his pillow for his ink bottle and a roll of parchment. Slowly and",

Satisfied, he folded the parchment and sealed it with wax. Then he placed it in an envelope addressed to the king. The next morning, he took the letter to the post office and mailed it. A week later, he received a reply from the king. It was a short note, but it said everything he needed to know. The king had read his letter and understood his feelings. He had decided to grant him a pardon. The man was free to return to his family and live out the rest of his days in peace. As he read the letter, tears welled up in his eyes. He couldn’t believe it. He had been granted a second chance. He would never forget the day he received that letter. It was the best day of his life.\n\n",

They have in their day become peculiarly settled and slow-moving. Their blood and bone are the products of long peace and luxury, being since the end of the Age of Woe and War some 6,000 years ago. For many long years the Shire was their home, and their home alone. They were small and hairy, lived in holes in the ground or under trees, and grew old without ever seeing a dragon or a demon. They took no interest in politics or wars, preferred farming and drinking good ale to fighting, and hated magic. They were not bad folk, just rather dull. But they clung to their own ways,",

They were perfectly furnished with linen presses, and bedsomes, and garths, and houses for ornaments; also with chests and clothes-presses and with old family-portraits framed in carven wood: and above all with pans and kettle-hangers and ladles and spoons and cannikins and cups and drinking horns, arranged on mighty open shelves reaching clear up to the top of the roof.

Against the back wall of that space is a pegboard on which only a few electronic keys hang. As an experienced player, he often notices things that seem mundane but that eventually prove to be essential to a winning strategy. Santana opens an interior door, and Calaphas follows him into a vestibule. “Leave your raincoat. Don’t go drippin’ all over the place.” As they proceed along a hallway toward the lobby at the front of the building, Santana speaks a name and says, “Know who that is?” “He’s a United States senator.” Santana mentions another name. Calaphas says, “Investment fund boss. Oversees trillions.” The third name is Katherine Ormond-Wattley, the director of the ISA, to whom Calaphas answers if he answers to anyone. “Them three,” Santana says, “is so tight with Woodbine they’re Siamese twins.” “Four twins.” “You get what I’m sayin’?” “With some effort.” “Get it outta your head how Woodbine’s just some mouthpiece you can keep waitin’ while you have port. I don’t work for no pocket-change pussy. The man is on the ladder, not just on it, high up.” “Good for him. Good for you. Look, I’m sorry. It’s been a long day, that’s all.” Although of a style different from that of seventeenth-century France, the lobby rivals the Hall of Mirrors in the palace at Versailles as an effort to impress on commoners that he who resides here has pockets deeper than the sea.

They have in their day become peculiarly settled and slow-moving. Their blood and bone are the products of long peace and luxury, being since the end of the Age of Woe and War some 6,000 years ago. For many long years the Shire was their home, and their home alone. They were small and hairy, lived in holes in the ground or under trees, and grew old without ever seeing a dragon or a demon. They took no interest in politics or wars, preferred farming and drinking good ale to fighting, and hated magic. They were not bad folk, just rather dull. But they clung to their own ways,",

I know I would have. I thought of Shane and his accident. Madame Bowden had hardly flinched. Something was tugging at my mind and I wondered why she hadn’t come down for breakfast yet. Every morning she was the one to wake me with her shrill voice and endless demands. What if there was something wrong with her? With every step I climbed I told myself I was being stupid and that she was just having a nice long lie in, but I didn’t really believe it. I knocked on the door to her bedroom and, after a moment, let myself in. My eyes adjusted to the scene. Her bed had not been slept in and she herself was nowhere to be seen. ‘Madame Bowden?’ I called out. ‘Are you there?’ The door to the ensuite was slightly ajar, but on further inspection, it was empty. ‘Hello?’ I called out on to the landing, but the house had such an air of stillness that I knew I was alone. I checked downstairs for a note but there was nothing. Of course she did not have a mobile phone, so I couldn’t call her. She refused to have her daily movements monitored by technology companies. I wasn’t sure what to do and spent the morning wandering from room to room, looking out of the windows at the street outside every few minutes. ‘Do you have any of her friends’ numbers that you could call?’ my mother asked, when the worry became too much and I had to call someone. ‘I can’t remember any of their names and there’s no address book or anything.’ It was only now I realised that I knew so little about the woman. ‘Should I call the police? What if she’s wandered off somewhere and forgotten where she is?’ ‘Has she ever seemed forgetful?’ my mother asked. ‘Well, no, but you saw her when you were here, she is pretty\n\n\nComplete the prefix:\nimmense black boots. â€œGood Morning!â€ said Bilbo, and he meant it.

Seven years ago , I still had my mother’s voice in my head—and her addictive nature in my body. I was afraid then that love would drown me, just like it had my mother. Lanier pleaded with me not to take Huff down with me. I loved him too much to do that. The irony that I later found myself sober, pregnant, and starting a family with a man I didn’t love as much wasn’t lost on me. But instead of saying that, I say, “Huff, you have this big, magical, amazing family. I have Lanier. So losing her would be like losing everything and everyone.” He wraps me in a hug. “You have me, Daphne,” he whispers. “You always have.” He pulls back and kisses me. “You are all I care about.

Many good folk lived there afterwards, even if not so many adventures happened. The world is full of fortune-but most people are fooled by it—a slip of the eye, a moment's lack of awareness, and the chance is gone. But Bilbo Baggins had some warning, and took some precautions. So, odd as it may seem, and though he never invented anything, except a perfect meal, real comfort had come into his long and very uneventful life. He could now have 'slept on roses' (as people used to say) without anxiety all the days that were left to him. And beautiful roses they were, beside his window, which he himself had often trained and tied, busy and unknown. His sleep was seldom disturbed, and he heard and saw",

The tiniest part of me has hoped she would approve of this relationship now, if there ever was one. But Lanier apparently still doesn’t trust me. “Daph, forget Lanier. Let’s do this. Finally.” I consider his offer briefly because, well, it’s what I want to do. But I shake my head. “If we get together right now, Lanier will know it’s because we met up at the wedding and she’ll blame me. She’ll be furious.” Huff sighs and rolls his eyes. “Damn, Daph. Why do you care so much? What happened back then was a long time ago. She has to realize that.” He is partially right. But our big breakup, when we were twenty-three and twenty-five, had less to do with her and more with what I’d thought was the right thing. But it was easier to blame her than to blame myself. Seven years ago , I still had my mother’s voice in my head—and her addictive nature in my body. I was afraid then that love would drown me, just like it had my mother. Lanier pleaded with me not to take Huff down with me. I loved him too much to do that. The irony that I later found myself sober, pregnant, and starting a family with a man I didn’t love as much wasn’t lost on me. But instead of saying that, I say, “Huff, you have this big, magical, amazing family. I have Lanier.

The tiniest part of me has hoped she would approve of this relationship now, if there ever was one. But Lanier apparently still doesn’t trust me. “Daph, forget Lanier. Let’s do this. Finally.” I consider his offer briefly because, well, it’s what I want to do. But I shake my head. “If we get together right now, Lanier will know it’s because we met up at the wedding and she’ll blame me. She’ll be furious.” Huff sighs and rolls his eyes. “Damn, Daph. Why do you care so much? What happened back then was a long time ago. She has to realize that.” He is partially right. But our big breakup, when we were twenty-three and twenty-five, had less to do with her and more with what I’d thought was the right thing. But it was easier to blame her than to blame myself. Seven years ago , I still had my mother’s voice in my head—and her addictive nature in my body. I was afraid then that love would drown me, just like it had my mother. Lanier pleaded with me not to take Huff down with me. I loved him too much to do that. The irony that I later found myself sober, pregnant, and starting a family with a man I didn’t love as much wasn’t lost on me.

At the same time they dislike being reminded that their own family-tree, if exposed to the light, might look rather shabby. Bilbo Baggins, of Bag End, the (in these parts) respectable hobbit (he was very rich and very peculiar), was much obliged to you for thinking that a present of twelve cakes was enough for himself and thirteen guests.

Hearing news of this resistance, the other two Survivor Towns had co-ordinated their efforts, sending representatives from the settlements. New Town was the largest of the three and Trinity Town was located at the tip of the Peninsula. Each of these towns had markedly different characters. New Town considered itself a rival in status to McMurdo, far less bohemian than Hope Town. The citizens placed an overwhelming emphasis on food production, energy and mining, the practicalities of survival. Trinity Town, with the most clement weather, contained a large concentration of people interested in their physical and mental welfare, discovering natural medicines in the ocean, a deeply spiritual community with the most places of worship.

New Town was the largest of the three and Trinity Town was located at the tip of the Peninsula. Each of these towns had markedly different characters. New Town considered itself a rival in status to McMurdo, far less bohemian than Hope Town. The citizens placed an overwhelming emphasis on food production, energy and mining, the practicalities of survival. Trinity Town, with the most clement weather, contained a large concentration of people interested in their physical and mental welfare, discovering natural medicines in the ocean, a deeply spiritual community with the most places of worship. To this extent, the Peninsula most closely resembled the division of industry in the nation formerly known as Germany, with an industrial heartland, a bohemian Berlin, the financial city of Frankfurt and the spa towns in the mountains. Kasim stepped forward to address the crowds: ‘My name is Kasim. We are here to collect the last of the ice-adapted students. And those ordinary-born who have been chosen to work at McMurdo.’ Liza declared: ‘I’m the mother of one of those ice-adapted children you’ve come to collect. All we’re asking is to travel with them. To see the kind of life they will have in McMurdo. To make sure they are going to be okay. We want to know what’s going on in McMurdo. You tell us nothing. You ask for everything.’ Kasim gestured at his vehicles. ‘I understand the request. But you can see our convoy. We have four vehicles.

I remember once when he told a story about a dragon who lived in a cave under a mountain, and every day he would go out and eat sheep and goats and cows and horses, and then he would fly back to his cave and sleep until the next morning. One day, though, the dragon got tired of eating animals, so he decided to try something new. He went down to the village where the people lived, and he found a little girl playing by herself. She was very pretty, with long golden hair and big blue eyes, and the dragon thought she would make a nice change from all the boring old animals he had been eating. So he picked her up and flew away with her, back to his cave under the mountain. When he got there, he put her down gently and said, “Now, my dear, I am going to cook you for dinner",

I remember once when he told a story about a dragon who lived in a cave under a mountain, and every day he would go out and eat sheep and goats and cows and horses, and then he would fly back to his cave and sleep until the next morning. One day, though, the dragon got tired of eating animals, so he decided to try something new. He went down to the village where the people lived, and he found a little girl playing by herself. She was very pretty, with long golden hair and big blue eyes, and the dragon thought she would make a nice change from all the boring old animals he had been eating. So he picked her up and flew away with her, back to his cave under the mountain. When he got there, he put her down gently and said, “Now, my dear, I am going to cook you for dinner",

The door opened on to a tube-shaped hall like a tunnel: a very comfortable tunnel without smoke, with panelled walls, and floors tiled and carpeted, provided with polished chairs, and lots of pegs for hats and coats—the hobbit was fond of visitors. The tunnel wound on and on, going fairly but not quite straight into the side of the hill —The Hill, as all the people for many miles round called it—and many little round doors opened out of it, first on one side and then on another.

The doctor also despised him, and had been heard to remark that he would not say ‘pig’ to a pig. Martin smiled grimly to himself. He knew very well why the doctor hated him.

Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone is J.K. Rowling's first novel written for children. Harry starts at Hogwarts in September of 1991. The book charts his first year at the school, his discovery of the philosopher's stone, and the unmasking of Lord Voldemort as he returns to power and kidnaps Harry's godfather, Sirius Black.\n\nThe book won the British Book Awards Children's Book of the Year, was short",

The so-called hospital was more like a health clinic straight out of the twentieth century. The reception room was about two hundred square feet, with speckled brown and white linoleum tiles, egg-colored walls half covered with battered oak wainscoting having seen better days decades ago. There was a large bay window in serious need of a good scrubbing, but it at least allowed the morning sun in to brighten the all but otherwise unremarkable room.

I knocked on the door to her bedroom and, after a moment, let myself in. My eyes adjusted to the scene. Her bed had not been slept in and she herself was nowhere to be seen. ‘Madame Bowden?’ I called out. ‘Are you there?’ The door to the ensuite was slightly ajar, but on further inspection, it was empty. ‘Hello?’ I called out on to the landing, but the house had such an air of stillness that I knew I was alone. I checked downstairs for a note but there was nothing. Of course she did not have a mobile phone, so I couldn’t call her. She refused to have her daily movements monitored by technology companies. I wasn’t sure what to do and spent the morning wandering from room to room, looking out of the windows at the street outside every few minutes. ‘Do you have any of her friends’ numbers that you could call?’ my mother asked, when the worry became too much and I had to call someone. ‘I can’t remember any of their names and there’s no address book or anything.’ It was only now I realised that I knew so little about the woman. ‘Should I call the police?

He turned around and saw a man standing there. The man was wearing a black suit and tie, and he had a gun in his hand. “What are you doing?” the man said. “Who are you?” “My name is John Smith,” the man said. “And who are you?” “I’m the new neighbour,” John said. “I moved in next door yesterday.” “Oh, okay,” the man said. “I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to scare you.” “It’s okay,” John said. “I’m just a bit jumpy since the break-in.” “Yeah, I heard about that",

The man was wearing a dark blue overcoat and a black hat pulled down over his eyes. He was carrying a suitcase in his hand. “Good evening,” the man said. “I’m sorry to trouble you, but I wonder if you can help me? I’ve just arrived in town and I’m trying to find a hotel. Do you happen to know of one nearby?” “Yes, certainly,” the man said. “There’s a very nice one just round the corner. It’s called the Grand Hotel.",

After all, they wanted nothing more than to accompany their children, to see what kind of work they’d be doing and how life was progressing in the secretive city of McMurdo. Hearing news of this resistance, the other two Survivor Towns had co-ordinated their efforts, sending representatives from the settlements. New Town was the largest of the three and Trinity Town was located at the tip of the Peninsula. Each of these towns had markedly different characters. New Town considered itself a rival in status to McMurdo, far less bohemian than Hope Town. The citizens placed an overwhelming emphasis on food production, energy and mining, the practicalities of survival. Trinity Town, with the most clement weather, contained a large concentration of people interested in their physical and mental welfare, discovering natural medicines in the ocean, a deeply spiritual community with the most places of worship.

All she’d said on the subject was that she couldn’t allow anyone to get hurt on her account. The leaders of Hope Town had travelled with Liza, hoping to mediate the negotiations. After all, they wanted nothing more than to accompany their children, to see what kind of work they’d be doing and how life was progressing in the secretive city of McMurdo. Hearing news of this resistance, the other two Survivor Towns had co-ordinated their efforts, sending representatives from the settlements. New Town was the largest of the three and Trinity Town was located at the tip of the Peninsula. Each of these towns had markedly different characters. New Town considered itself a rival in status to McMurdo, far less bohemian than Hope Town. The citizens placed an overwhelming emphasis on food production, energy and mining, the practicalities of survival. Trinity Town, with the most clement weather, contained a large concentration of people interested in their physical and mental welfare, discovering natural medicines in the ocean, a deeply spiritual community with the most places of worship.

But he had found that magic, like music, couldn't be learned from a book; it needed to come out of you; and there seemed little point in writing spells you weren't able to do. He had tried to get Hedwig to deliver letters to Ron and Hermione, but she had refused to leave the room, hiding her head under her wing whenever he approached her cage. Harry had written to them twice, but neither letter had been returned. He had no idea whether they were avoiding him deliberately, or whether they simply hadn't received his letters. It was very lonely in the Dursleys' house. Harry kept thinking about the day he had left Hogwarts, walking through the streets of London with Hagrid, both of them crying their eyes out - it seemed a lifetime ago. He remembered what Dumbledore had said to him",
