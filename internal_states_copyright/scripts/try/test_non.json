They are also said to be able to talk to animals and birds, and to understand what they say. In some versions of the story, they can even turn into animals themselves. The Lapps were originally described as being tall and handsome, but later accounts describe them as short and ugly. Some stories say that they are descended from giants, while others claim that they are the offspring of trolls. Whatever their origins, the Lapps have always been considered to be a mysterious and magical people. Today, there are still many Lappish traditions and customs that are unique to this group of people. For example, they often use reindeer as transportation instead of horses or cars, and they continue to make traditional handicrafts such as weaving and carving. Despite their small population size, the Lapps remain an important part of Scandinavian culture and history.",
