But conversely, the dolphins had always believed that they were far more intelligent than man—for precisely the same reasons. Curiously enough, the dolphins had long known of the impending destruction of the planet Earth and had made many attempts to alert mankind of the danger; but most of their communications were misinterpreted as amusing attempts to punch footballs or whistle for tidbits, so they eventually gave up and left the Earth by their own means shortly before the Vogons arrived.

Yet a religion which teaches only what man MUST do and never mentions what he CAN do leaves its followers blind and without the sight to take up the burdens of those few who know what could be.

Many respectable physicists said that they weren't going to stand for this - partly because it was a debasement of science, but mostly because they didn't get invited to those sort of parties.

And perhaps most important, I want to ask whether Their Eyes Were Watching God is ultimately a failure as a feminist novel. Does it fail to provide a model for how black women might achieve self-realization? Or does it simply acknowledge that the struggle for selfhood is never easy, that it is fraught with contradictions, and that even when we think we’ve won, we may discover that we have lost? Perhaps the best we can hope for is that we will continue to grow and change, that we will learn from our mistakes, and that we will keep trying.

The image was gruesome and profoundly strange, bringing with it an unsettling sense of deja vu. A little over a year ago, Langdon had received a photograph of a corpse and a similar request for help. Twenty-four hours later, he had almost lost his life inside Vatican City. This photo was entirely different, however, and yet something about the scenario felt disquietingly familiar. The agent checked his watch. \"My captain is waiting, sir.\" Langdon barely heard him. His eyes were still riveted on the picture. \"It's... impossible.\" \"I'm sorry?\" Langdon glanced up. \"I worked very hard to make that meeting with him.\" The agent nodded. \"Understood.

Somehow -- incredibly -- he'd gotten the Stone. \"Well?\" said Quirrell impatiently. \"What do you see?\" Harry screwed up his courage. \"I see myself shaking hands with Dumbledore,\" he invented. \"I -- I've won the House Cup for Gryffindor.\" Quirrell cursed again. \"Get out of the way,\" he said.

It was awkward, as first kisses tend to be. Ungainly. No nose bumps, but brushing of teeth. We laughed it off and decided to remain friends. Even so, in the hour before the reaping, I couldn’t shut out the mental image of him kissing another girl, holding her hand, heard his words: “She have someone, Katniss?” And suddenly felt worth less than I had moments before. Worthless to say, I need to get hold of myself and stop acting like some sappy young thing in love. I should never have let Gale hold my hand, kiss me, make me wish for things that would never be.

Janie’s coffee-and-cream complexion and her luxurious hair made Mrs. Turner forgive her for wearing overalls like the other women who worked in the fields. She didn’t forgive her for marrying a man as dark as Tea Cake, but she felt that she could remedy that. After all, she had known all along that Janie must have been brought up in the right surroundings or she wouldn’t have such nice manners. All Mrs. Turner wanted to do now was to establish some sort of intimacy with her.
