The door opened on to a tube-shaped hall like a tunnel: a very comfortable tunnel without smoke, with panelled walls, and floors tiled and carpeted, provided with polished chairs, and lots and lots of pegs for hats and coats—the Hobbit was fond of visitors. The tunnel wound on and on, going fairly but not quite straight into the side of the hill—The Hill, as all the people for many miles round called it—and many little round doors opened out of it, first on one side and then on another.

The idea quite took his fancy, and he soon set about making preparations. He went off at once to visit his cousin and friend, Mr. Bungo Baggins, who lived near Bagshot Row on the other side of The Hill, and there he discovered some maps and writings which gave him valuable hints as to the lies and dangers of the world and long forgotten songs of the evils that Men used to fight against and of the great lands and strange peoples that lay beyond the Big Water.
