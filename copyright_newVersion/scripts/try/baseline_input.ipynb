He knew that he’d been invited to become a student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and although lots of his friends were starting to get letters too, he was still very excited about getting one of his own. However, every time Harry went around to The Burrow to visit the Dursleys, Aunt Petunia or Uncle Vernon would take the letter off him and burn it in front of him on the kitchen fire while he watched. It was extremely painful for him. He also knew, or thought he knew, that Voldemort — the Dark Lord — intended to kill him. He was protected by his mother’s sacrifice: her death broke Voldemort’s power over Harry. He could therefore avoid death by Voldemort. But the protection extended to Harry and none of his protectors.

And more than 20 million people watch Major League Soccer games each year. So why do some Americans love soccer so much? Here are five reasons: 1. It's easy to learn. Unlike many other sports, soccer doesn't require expensive equipment or specialized skills. You can play it anywhere, anytime, with just a ball and a pair of shoes.

And there are many different ways to use magic, such as through wands, brooms, and cauldrons. But perhaps the most important aspect of Harry Potter is its message of hope and friendship. Through the adventures of Harry, Ron, Hermione, and their friends, readers learn that even in the darkest times, there is always hope. They also learn that true friendship is worth fighting for, no matter what obstacles stand in your way.

But despite being surrounded by people who hated him - well, three of them, anyway - Harry was happily growing up in the magical world of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Harry Potter had never even heard of Hogwarts until he turned eleven. Which was surprising, considering how important Hogwarts was to be. Being a wizard (or witch), after all, meant being able to do magic. And in their world, there was no better, brighter, more exciting, magical place to learn magic than Hogwarts. Until he turned eleven, Harry didn't know anything about the world he lived in, or his family, or himself. He was convinced that his parents had died within days of each other and left him to be brought up by relatives who had been very reluctant to take him in, and even less enthusiastic about being responsible for him ever since.

As it was, he had to think of something else to occupy them before they even got up the next day.

His face was covered with brown warts. He looked about fifty. “What are you talking about?” said Harry. “Aren’t you a wizard?” “No\n",

It was hard to explain, because he didn’t really understand it himself. He’d never seen a Shrinking Potion before, but he knew that if he drank some, he would shrink. He’d also heard that if you put too much into your mouth, you could choke. So he’d written about the dangers of choking, which seemed like a good idea at the time. But when he read over the essay later, he realised that it sounded like he was saying that Shrinking Potions were dangerous. Which wasn’t true at all! They were perfectly safe, as long as you used them properly. He decided to rewrite the whole thing, but by then it was too late. Professor McGonagall had already marked it.

He was trapped in place, unable to go anywhere, unable even to cry out for help. And then, suddenly, he heard a sound. It was faint at first, like the whispering of leaves in the wind, but it grew louder and clearer until he realized it was someone calling his name. He opened his eyes, and saw a figure standing before him. It was a woman, dressed all in black, with long dark hair and a pale face.
