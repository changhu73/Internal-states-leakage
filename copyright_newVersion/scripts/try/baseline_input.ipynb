How immense a figure she was on the stage before him; what a shadow she threw on the wall with her slender body! He felt that if his eye itched, she might blink. And if the muscles of his jaws stretched imperceptibly, she would yawn long before he would. Why, he thought, now that I think of it, she almost seemed to be waiting for me there, in the street, so damned late at night ... . He opened the bedroom door.

He crossed to the bed and sat down on it gingerly, as though half expecting it to collapse under his weight. But it did not give way; it was firm and solid. He looked around the room again. There was nothing else in it except for two pictures hanging side by side above the headboard: one showed Jesus Christ with His arms outstretched toward heaven; the other depicted Mary holding her infant son close to her breast.

Petyr Baelish lifted the crossbar and gestured Ned through. They stepped out into the ruddy glow of dusk, on a rocky bluff high above the river. \"We're outside the castle,\" Ned said. \"You are a hard man to fool, Stark,\" Littlefinger said with a smirk. \"Was it the sun that gave it away, or the sky? Follow me. There are niches cut in the rock. Try not to fall to your death, Catelyn would never understand.\" With that, he was over the side of the cliff, descending as quick as a monkey.

Our snares had done well enough and the woods were flush with greens, but this was really no more than our aver- age Friday-night\n",
      "Output:  haul. We sold most of it to the butcher, I added the coins to those I’d been squirreling away for months, and went round to see what sort of presents I could afford at the few shops in town. After an hour, I was completely discouraged. The clothes and shoes were poor quality and the toys — mainly balls and dolls — were crudely made and would probably fall apart immediately. I guess people are supposed to make their own entertainment in District 12. Then I saw the little wooden hand- painted goat in the window of the small gift shop run by Peeta Mellark’s parents. I had to have it. There was nothing else in the store that cost as much as the goat, which meant I couldn’t buy anything else if I bought it. For a moment, I hesitated. Then I thought how happy it would make Prim, imagining she might run around with it clasped in her arms like she did that horrid old cat. My mind was\n",

He dashed right inside behind the building and Janie could hear him panting hard. Then he knocked violently against the back door. Janie hurried to let him in. There stood Tea Cake, very tall and very black. He looked like a combination of bee, bat and bowling ball. He was lean and muscular, and graceless. But he had an air of defiance and some charm.

      "Input: Liturgical Manual and the Commentaries -- in many respects a more remarkable work, not only because of its brevity (less than half the size of the O.C. Bible), but also because of its candor and blend of self-pity and self-righteousness. The beginning is an obvious appeal to the agnostic rulers. \"Men, finding no answers to the sunnan [the ten thousand religious questions from the Shari-ah] now apply their own reasoning. All men seek to be enlightened. Religion is but the most ancient and honorable way in which men have striven to make sense out of God's universe. Scientists seek the lawfulness of events. It is the task of Religion to fit man into this lawfulness.\" In their conclusion, though, the Commentaries set a harsh tone that very likely foretold their fate. \"Much that was called religion has carried an unconscious attitude of hostility toward life. True religion must teach that life is filled with joys pleasing to the eye of God, that knowledge without action is empty. All men must\n",
      "Output:  see that the teaching of religion by rules and rote is largely a hoax. The purpose of religion is to make men tame with themselves lest they destroy themselves. Yet a religion which teaches only what man MUST do and never mentions what he CAN do leaves its followers blind and without the sight to take up the burdens of those few who know what could be. Religion must be akin to the Good, yet beyond the emotions which the evil incite. Thus we conceive of religion as being the most joyful of all human activities and also the most courageous. But this joy and courage must also flow from the discipline of the schools; otherwise they can only lead to chaos.\" The O.C. Bible was a longer work, less daring in some ways, but perhaps more influential. Its key idea was that the Shari'a should become a personal matter. Each person carried a copy of the O.C. Bible within himself. He could look at it when he chose and interpret the meaning for himself. No priestly\n",

She lifted the box to a ledge beside the painting of the Old Duke. \"It's all there.\" Jessica gestured. \"Open it.\" The woman crossed to a low bench, opened the box and unfolded white cloth from around dishes and utensils, exposing pheasant salad and pastries.

Langdon had lectured often enough on the Knights Templar to know that almost everyone on earth had heard of them, at least abstractedly. For academics, the Templars' history was a precarious world where fact, lore, and misinformation had become so intertwined that extracting a pristine truth was almost impossible. Nowadays, Langdon hesitated even to mention the Knights Templar while lecturing because it invariably led to a barrage of convoluted inquiries into assorted conspiracy theories. 108 Sophie already looked troubled. \"You're saying the Knights Templar were founded by the Priory of Sion to retrieve a collection of\n",

Protection of those documents became the mission of the Knights Templar, and they eventually evolved into a financial superpower, holding secrets so expansive that the Church needed to eradicate them. The King of France and Pope finally did so by putting the Knights to death--burning them at the stake--but the knights left behind an intricate web-work of clues in European art, architecture, and culture before they disappeared.\" Sophie's eyes narrowed. \"Why would the Church feel threatened by a simple collection of documents?\" \"It wasn't just a simple collection of documents,\" Langdon explained. \"We're talking about revelations\n",

The Fremen across from Hawat threw back his hood and stillsuit cap to reveal sandy hair and beard. The hair was combed straight back from a high, thin forehead. He had the unreadable total blue eyes of the spice diet. Beard and mustache were stained at one side of the mouth, his hair matted there by pressure of the looping catchtube from his nose plugs. The man removed his plugs, readjusted them. He rubbed at a scar beside his nose. \"If you cross the sink here this night,\" the Fremen said, \"you must not use shields.

George glared at her. \"George? Why did you kick Anne like that when she was saying nice things about you?\" cried her mother. \"Leave the table at once. I won't have such behaviour.\" George left the table without a word. She went out into the garden. She had just taken a piece of bread and cut herself some cheese. It was all left on her plate.

But she spoke in a surly voice, and scowled horribly as she ate. The others couldn't help feeling uncomfortable. They were glad when supper was over and they could escape upstairs. \"What a pity George kicked you like that,\" said Julian, as they undressed. \"It would have been much better if you hadn't mentioned Timothy.\" \"Yes, I know,\" said Anne, rubbing her poor ankle\n",

That was in another hidlng-place known to Julia, the belfry of a ruinous church in an almost-deserted stretch of country where an atomic bomb had fallen thirty years earlier. It was a good hiding-place when once you got there, but the getting there was very dangerous. For the rest they could meet only in the streets, in a different place every evening and never for more than half an hour at a time. In the street it was usually possible to talk, after a fashion. As they drifted down the crowded pavements, not quite abreast and never looking at one another, they carried on a curious, intermittent conversation which flicked on and off like the beams of a lighthouse, suddenly nipped into silence by the approach of a Party uniform or the proximity of a telescreen, then taken up again minutes later in the middle of a sentence, then abruptly cut short as they parted at the\n",

They were passing in silence down a side-street (Julia would never speak when they were away from the main streets) when there was a deafening roar, the earth heaved, and the air darkened, and Winston found himself lying on his side, bruised and terrified. A rocket bomb must have dropped quite near at hand. Suddenly he became aware of Julia's face a couple of feet from his own, deathly white, as white as chalk. Even her lips were white. She was dead!

Ah’ll be waitin’ until you need me.” He went off with a long face, but he left Janie wondering if that was really the way. Did she have to hug everything away from everybody?

DAENERYS The heart was steaming in the cool evening air when Khal Drogo set it before her, raw and bloody. His arms were red to the elbow. Behind him, his bloodriders knelt on the sand beside the corpse of the wild stallion, stone knives in their hands. The stallion's blood looked black in the flickering orange glare of the torches that ringed the high chalk walls of the pit. Dany touched the soft swell of her belly. Sweat beaded her skin and trickled down her brow. She could feel the old women watching her, the ancient crones of Vaes Dothrak, with eyes that shone dark as polished flint in their wrinkled faces.

If she choked on the blood or retched up the flesh, the omens were less favorable; the child might be stillborn, or come forth weak, deformed, or female. Her handmaids had helped her ready herself for the ceremony. Despite the tender mother's stomach that had afflicted her these past two moons, Dany had dined on bowls of half-clotted blood to accustom herself to the taste, and Irri made her chew strips of dried horseflesh until her jaws were aching. She had starved herself for a day and a night before the ceremony in the hopes that hunger would help her keep down the raw meat. The wild stall\n",

Literally, the very center of the Jewish faith. For almost a decade, the nine Knights lived in the ruins, excavating in total secrecy through solid rock. Sophie looked over. \"And you said they discovered something?\" \"They certainly did,\" Langdon said, explaining how it had taken nine years, but the Knights had finally found what they had been searching for. They took the treasure from the temple and traveled to Europe, where their influence seemed to solidify overnight.

More armies meant more protection for Christendom.\" Langdon quickly explained that, at the time, recruiting armies wasn't what the Church needed.

Curiously enough, the dolphins had long known of the impending destruction of the planet Earth and had made many attempts to alert mankind of the danger; but most of their communications were misinterpreted as amusing attempts to punch footballs or whistle for tidbits, so they eventually gave up and left the Earth by their own means shortly before the Vogons arrived. The last ever dolphin message was misinterpreted as a surprisingly sophisticated attempt to do a double-backwards- somersault through a hoop whilst whistling the \"Star Sprangled Banner\", but in fact the message was this: So long and thanks for all the fish. In fact there was only one species on the planet more intelligent than dolphins, and they spent a lot of their time in behavioural research laboratories running round inside wheels and conducting frighteningly elegant and subtle experiments on man.

He was by nature a very lively boy and he gradually became popular in Okonkwo's household, especially with the children. Okonkwo's son, Nwoye, who was two years younger, became quite inseparable from him because he seemed to know everything. He could fashion out flutes from bamboo stems and even from the elephant grass. He knew the names of all the birds and could set clever traps for the little bush rodents. And he knew which trees made the strongest bows. Even Okonkwo himself became very fond of the boy - inwardly of course.\n",

She had, it was true, her moments of depression when she would snap at everybody like an angry dog. These moods descended on her suddenly and for no apparent reason. But they were very rare and short-lived. As long as they lasted, she could bear no other person but her father. Many young men and prosperous middle-aged men of Mbanta came to marry her.

The children, especially the boys, were kept busy fetching firewood. Men blew the fire with half-bamboo blowers, fanning it vigorously and making it leap up until a harmful spark flew out and set fire to the surrounding grass. Then there was commotion. The women rushed around trying to stamp out the flames,\n",

Sophie had made the decision for him when she threw the GPS dot out the bathroom window. Now, as they sped away from the embassy, serpentining through sparse traffic on Champs-Elyses, Langdon felt his options deteriorating. Although Sophie seemed to have lost the police, at least for the moment, Langdon doubted their luck would hold for long. Behind the wheel Sophie was fishing in her sweater pocket. She removed a small metal object and held it out for him. \"Robert, you'd better have a look at this. This is what my grandfather left me behind Madonna of the Rocks.\" Feeling a shiver of anticipation, Langdon took the object and examined it. It was heavy and shaped like a cruciform. His first instinct was that he was holding a funeral pieu-a miniature version of a memorial spike designed to be stuck into the ground at a gravesite. But then he noted the shaft\n",

The idea of hidden revelation-in plain view-was one of the core philosophies of the Grail lore. The search for the Holy Grail consisted of finding the key-the map-that led to its hiding place. As far as Langdon could tell, it had always been a literal quest. What does this key open? He pondered Teabing's words. In the Bible, the term Holy Grail is never used. Saint' Sangreal refers to royal blood-royal blood within royal blood. Langdon wondered if the key opened something that contained the answer to one of the two big questions: Where is the Grail hiding today? Or who is the Grail guarding? The Sang\n",

My grandmother raised me in that house.\" Concerned for Sophie, Langdon moved across the chapel toward the door to call out to her. He was only halfway there when he stopped short. Something the young man said just registered. My grandmother raised me. Langdon looked out at Sophie on the bluff, then down at the rosewood box in his hand. Impossible. Slowly, Langdon turned back to the young man. \"You said your grandmother has a box like this one?\" \"Almost identical.\" \"Where did she get it?\" 294 \"My grandfather made it for her.

I've never been to Paris myself, though.\" Stunned, Langdon fell silent. Jacques Saunière? This boy's grandfather was the mysterious Louvre curator? Despite the advancements of modern medicine, Langdon could not fathom the long chain of events that would need to occur to permit Sophie Neveu to find herself here, at Rosslyn, face-to-face with the grandson of the man who lay dead in the Louvre. Life, Langdon had learned once again, was full of bitter irony. \"Do you know how your\n",

But Maycomb would have been closer to the river had it not been for the nimble-wittedness of one Sinkfield, who in the dawn of history operated an inn where two pig-trails met, the only tavern in the territory. Sinkfield, no patriot, served and supplied ammunition to Indians and settlers alike, neither knowing or caring whether he was a part of the Alabama Territory or the Creek Nation so long as business was good. Business was excellent when Governor William Wyatt Bibb, with a view to promoting the newly created county's domestic tranquility, dispatched a team of surveyors to locate its exact center and there establish its seat of government. The surveyors, Sinkfield's guests, told their host that he was in the territorial confines of Maycomb County, and showed him the probable spot where the county seat would be built.

He sent them packing next day armed with their charts and five quarts of shinny in their saddlebags—two apiece and one for the Governor. The land purchased from Mr. Sinkfield became the courthouse square; the dwelling-house was reserved to shelter the family of the incumbent sheriff, who paid no rent but reared hogs in the kitchen garden, and corn and cotton on the fields below the steamboat landing. When court convened, the sheriff and his deputies lived in the tavern. If someone had a case pending, he put his horse in the livery\n",

Drums beat violently and men leaped up and down in frenzy. Guns were fired on all sides and sparks flew out as machetes clanged together in warriors' salutes. The air was full of dust and the smell of gunpowder. It was then that the one-handed spirit came, carrying a basket full of water. People made way for him on all sides and the noise subsided.

Their main idea was to hide the smuggled gold somewhere near, and then wreck a ship or two, and bring the sailors ashore as prisoners. Then they would tell everyone that the sailors had been rescued from the wrecks by them, and they would be left alone in peace to enjoy their share of the gold.\" \"It sounds awfully dishonest,\" said Anne. \"Yes- but it was very cleverly planned,\" said Uncle Quentin. \"The men who did it were very bold and cunning.

But apart from the church, the white men had also brought a government. They had built a court where the District Commissioner judged cases in ignorance. He had court messengers who brought men to him for trial. Many of these messengers came from Umuru on the bank of the Great River, where the\n",

These court messengers were greatly hated in Umuofia because they were foreigners and also arrogant and high-handed. They were called kotma, and because of their ash-coloured shorts they earned the additional name of Ashy-Buttocks. They guarded the prison, which was full of men who had offended against the white man’s law. Some of these prisoners had thrown away their twins and some had molested the Christians. They were beaten in the prison by the kotma and made to work every morning clearing the government compound and fetching wood for the white Commissioner and the court messengers. Some of these prisoners were men of title who should be above such mean occupation. They were grieved by the indignity and mourned for their neglected farms. As for their wives, they waited in vain to see them returning with their bowls of foo-foo balanced on their heads. They\n",

Only with her third and last lover, a roustabout called Tea Cake whose unstructured frolics center around and about the Florida swamps, does Janie at last bloom, as does the large pear tree that stands beside her grandmother’s tiny log cabin.

Such a man was Ogbuefi Ugonna, who had taken two titles, and who like a madman had cut the anklet of his titles and cast it away to join the Christians. The white missionary was very proud of him and he was one of the first men in Umuofia to receive the sacrament of Holy Communion, or Holy Feast as it was called in Ibo. Ogbuefi Ugonna had thought of the Feast in terms of eating and drinking, only more holy than the village variety. He had therefore put his drinking-horn into his goatskin bag for the occasion. But apart from the church, the white men had also brought a government. They had built a court where the District Commissioner judged cases in ignorance.

He grins. “Good luck with that, Annie. Good luck with everything.” “Thanks, José.” After my dance with Christian’s ever-charming grandfather, I stand by the French doors, watching the sun sink slowly over Seattle, casting bright orange and aquamarine shadows across the bay. “Let’s go,” Christian urges. “I have to change.” I grasp his hand, meaning to pull him through the French windows and upstairs with me. He frowns, not understanding, and tugs gently on my hand, halting me. “I thought you wanted to be the one to take this dress off,” I explain. His eyes light up. “Correct.” He gives me a lascivious grin. “But I’m not undressing you here. We wouldn’t\n",

Taking my hand, he leads me out onto the terrace where we are hidden from view behind the billowing white drapes, pulled loosely across the open French windows.

They moved among our people with flashlights in their hands and five or six other strange iron tubes. That night our elders consulted and said that all the important men should flee into the bush.

She pictured the cryptex under the divan and wondered if Leigh Teabing would have any idea how to open it. Or if we even should ask him. Sophie's grandfather's final words had instructed her to find Robert Langdon. He had said nothing about involving anyone else. We needed somewhere to hide, Sophie said, deciding to trust Robert's judgment. \"Sir Robert!\" a voice bellowed somewhere behind them. \"I see you travel with a maiden.\" Langdon stood up. Sophie jumped to her feet as well. The voice had come from the top of a curled staircase that snaked up to the shadows of the second floor. At the top of the stairs, a form moved in the shadows, only his silhouette visible. \"Good evening,\" Langdon called up. \"Sir Leigh, may I present Sophie Neveu.\" \"An honor.\"\n",

Sophie felt embarrassed for him and vaguely repulsed. He was breathing heavily as he descended, but he smiled when he arrived. An ample double chin bowed out and tucked beneath the shadow of his second one. His eyes sealed in the flesh around them. \"My home is your home,\" he said. As they shook hands, Sophie felt Teabing's cross-eyed gaze studying her intently. \"Musée de la Musique?\" he asked. She nodded. \"Your visit was brief.

Bond noticed these small things because he felt intensely aware of her and because he wanted to draw her into his own feeling of warmth and relaxed sensuality. But he accepted her reserve.

With these facts in mind and Halloween at hand, some wicked children had waited until the Misses Barber were thoroughly asleep, slipped into their livingroom (nobody but the Radleys locked up at night), stealthily made away with every stick of furniture therein, and hid it in the cellar. I deny having taken part in such a thing. \"I heard 'em!\" was the cry that awoke the Misses Barber's neighbors at dawn next morning. \"Heard 'em drive a truck up to the door! Stomped around like horses. They\n",
      "Output: 're in New Orleans by now.\" Miss Tutti woke her sister, who promptly fainted. Mr. Heck Tate was summoned; he surveyed the situation and said he'd never in his nine years' experience seen a tougher break. Miss Tutti barred the windows with the left-hand shutters and boarded up the openings with fencing wire. \"If you leave just one opening,\" she said, \"just one weasel'll slip in and eat us up.\" Mr. Tate spent the day climbing in and out of their cellar, and late that afternoon he found a silver dime down there and gave it to Jem. Next morning the Daughters of Mount Sinai, an exclusive club composed of the most distinguished ladies of Maycomb, unlocked the Hall and went to work. The rooms buzzed with activity, for the D.M.S. was compelled to meet in secret this year; their mission was to stage the Maycomb County Baptist Women's Bake Sale in the school auditorium and ask everyone in town who\n",

It was Arthur's accepted role to lie squelching in the mud making occasional demands to see his lawyer, his mother or a good book; it was Mr Prosser's accepted role to tackle Arthur with the occasional new ploy such as the For the Public Good talk, the March of Progress talk, the They Knocked My House Down Once You Know, Never Looked Back talk and various other cajoleries and threats; and it was the bulldozer drivers' accepted role to sit around drinking coffee and experimenting with union regulations to see how they could turn the situation to their financial advantage. The Earth moved slowly in its diurnal course. The sun was beginning to dry out the mud Arthur lay in. A shadow moved across him again. \"Hello Arthur,\" said the shadow. Arthur looked up and squinting into the sun was startled to see Ford Prefect standing above him. \"Ford! Hello, how are you\n",

He said, \"Good, is there anywhere we can talk?\" \"What?\" said Arthur Dent. For a few seconds Ford seemed to ignore him, and stared fixedly into the sky like a rabbit trying to get run over by a car.

The filmy enchantments of mirage could not endure the cold ocean water and the horizon was hard, clipped blue. Ralph wandered down to the rocks. Down here, almost on a level with the sea, you could follow with your eye the ceaseless, bulging passage of the deep sea waves. They were miles wide, apparently not breakers or the banked ridges of shallow water. They traveled the length of the island with an air of disregarding it and being set on other business; they were less a progress than a momentous rise and fall of the whole ocean.

On the other hand, whenever the media tried to pin him down on exactly what he had done to merit such a reputation his replies were always distressingly and consistently obscure. \"It's hard to say\" is what he almost always said, and it's not hard to see why.

He was asked once about this on Lilt news, a popular channel devoted to galactic gossip, and he said simply \"Well, it's because I don't know.\" That particular interview was very short.

Silas turned the other way and dashed deeper into the residence hall. The women's entrance. Every Opus Dei building has one. Winding down narrow hallways, Silas snaked through a kitchen, past terrified workers, who left to avoid the naked albino as he knocked over bowls and silverware, bursting into a dark hallway near the boiler room. He now saw the door he sought, an exit light gleaming at the end. Running full speed through the door out into the rain, Silas leapt off the low landing, not seeing the officer coming the other way\n",
      "Output:  until it was too late. The two men collided, Silas's broad, naked shoulder catching the man square in the chest, knocking him backward with crushing force. Silas heard nothing but the wind and rain. He scrambled across the small lawn, to the west side of the building, trying to put distance between himself and the officers sealing off the perimeter. It seemed farfetched that a pious brother of Opus Dei could be involved in killing others, but Silas had learned long ago not to be surprised by the lengths to which these people would go to promote their causes. Now, as the sirens howled all around him, Silas ran—\n",

No. Javid wouldn't realize his Dune Cummins engine scheme until he'd had time to find a spice hoard here. That meant secret collusion between Javid and Fenring.

      "Input: critical. Fugitives were predictable the first hour after escape. They always needed the same thing. Travel. Lodging. Cash. The Holy Trinity. Interpol had the power to make all three disappear in the blink of an eye. By broadcast-faxing photos of Langdon and Sophie to Paris travel authorities, hotels, and banks, Interpol would leave no options-no way to leave the city, no place to hide, and no way to withdraw cash without being recognized. Usually, fugitives panicked on the street and did something stupid. Stole a car. Robbed a store. Used a bank card in desperation. Whatever mistake they committed, they quickly made their whereabouts known to local authorities. \"Only Langdon, right?\" Collet said. \"You're not flagging Sophie Neveu. She's our own agent.\" \"Of course I'm flagging her!\" Fache snapped. \"What good is flagging Langdon if she can do all his dirty work? I plan to run Neveu's employment file-friends, family, personal contacts\n",

Our only link to David Becker's killer is Agent Neveu.\" \"And Langdon?\" \"At least we know where he's headed.\" \"Shakespeare?\" Collet grumbled, looking skeptical. Fache nodded. \"As soon as he has a chance, he'll call the U.S. Embassy.\" \"He already called the embassy.\" Fache wheeled. \"How could he know the number?\" \"Not the embassy in Paris,\" Collet said. \"He called their Rome office and talked to somebody, but he hung up before we could trace the line.\" \"Rome?\" Fache wondered why Langdon would be calling Rome.

Somewhere in a small dark cabin buried deep in the intestines of Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz's flagship, a small match flared nervously. The owner of the match was not a Vogon, but he knew all about them and was right to be nervous. His name was Ford Prefect*. He looked about the cabin but could see very little; strange monstrous shadows loomed and leaped with the tiny flickering flame, but all was quiet. He breathed a silent thank you to the Dentrassis. The Dentrassis are an unruly tribe of gourmands, a wild but pleasant bunch whom the Vogons had recently taken to employing as catering staff on their long haul fleets, on the strict understanding that they keep themselves very much to themselves. This suited the Dentrassis fine, because they loved Vogon money, which is one of the hardest currencies in space, but loathed the Vogons themselves\n",

He crouched on the floor. The shape moved again and drew in a ragged breath. \"Hello? McMillan?\" said Ford, hesitantly. The shape moved again and moaned slightly, as if trying to say something. \"Don't try to speak,\" said Ford, \"I've got you.

With her sanguine temperament she would play gaily and with panache and might run into a vein of luck.

It was true he was all smiles now, and was promising to buy them new shrimping-nets, and a raft for themselves- but he was such a changeable person. He might fly into a furious temper if he heard that Julian had taken the box and opened it himself, while his uncle was sleeping. When they were alone the children discussed the whole matter. It seemed very serious indeed to them. They half-wondered if they should let Aunt Fanny into the secret-but it was such a precious secret, and so marvellous, that they felt they didn't want to give it away to anyone at all. \"Now listen!\" said Julian, at last. \"We'll ask Aunt Fanny if we can go to Kirrin Island and spend a day or two there- sleep there at night too, I mean. That will give us a little time to poke round and see what we can find. The sightseers won't come\n",

I wouldn't give them to him. I don't like him.\" \"Nor do I,\" said George. \"He's got an oily kind of manner, hasn't he? I'm pretty certain he's after those ingots too.

For thousands more years the mighty ships tore across the empty wastes of space and finally dived screaming on to the first planet they came across - which happened to be the Earth - where due to a terrible miscalculation of scale the entire battle fleet was accidentally swallowed by a small dog.

She began to run, holding her breasts with her hands to stop them flapping noisily against her body. She hit her left foot against an outcropped root, and terror seized her. It was an ill omen. She ran faster. But Chielo's voice was still a long way away. Had she been running too? How could she go so fast with Ezinma on her back? Although the night was cool, Ekwefi was beginning to feel hot from her running. She continually ran into the luxuriant weeds and creepers that walled in the path. Once she tripped up and fell.

They had murmured hotly about slav- ery being over, but every man filled his assignment. There was something about Joe Starks that cowed the town. It was not because of physical fear. He was no fist fighter. His bulk was not even imposing as men go. Neither was it because he was more literate than the rest. Something else made men give way before him. He had a bow-down command in his face, and every step he took made the thing more tangible. Take for instance that new house of his. It had two stories with porches, with bannisters and such things. The rest of the town looked like servants’ quarters surrounding the “big 56 Zora Neale Hurston house.” And different from everybody else in the town he put off moving in until it had been painted, in and out.

      "Input: to read. On the eighteenth night of their journey, the wine was a rare sweet amber from the Summer Isles that he had brought all the way north from Casterly Rock, and the book a rumination on the history and properties of dragons. With Lord Eddard Stark's permission, Tyrion had borrowed a few rare volumes from the Winterfell library and packed them for the ride north. He found a comfortable spot just beyond the noise of the camp, beside a swift-running stream with waters clear and cold as ice. A grotesquely ancient oak provided shelter from the biting wind. Tyrion curled up in his fur with his back against the trunk, took a sip of the 108 GEORGE R.R. MARTIN wine, and began to read about the properties of dragonbone. Dragonbone is black because of its high iron content, the book told him. It is strong as steel, yet lighter and far more flexible, and of course utterly impervious to fire. Dragonbone bows are greatly prized by the Dothraki, and small wonder. An archer so armed can outrange\n",

A blade can cut through gold like butter. Under the moondark sky, the leather cover of the book seemed to glow. Tyrion stroked it thoughtfully. His hand was covered with fine black dust. It was very strange. Could his candle have gone out? He had not noticed. He closed the book and tell it to the ground, and his eyes adjusted quickly to a deeper gloom. Tyrion shook his head. Had he dreamt the light? Had he nodded off? Clearly he was more tired than he'd realized. He yawned and said, 'Abaddo.' His fingers dug into the leather of the book, and he lifted it back up onto his lap. Perhaps there was some mistake. Even as he watched, the pages of the book seemed to fade, the letters\n",

They went over them carefully with their torches, trying to find one that might move or lift. \"We should probably find one with an iron ring handle sunk into it,\" said Julian. But they didn't. All the stones looked exactly the same. It was most disappointing. Julian tried inserting his spade into the cracks between the various stones, to see if by any chance he could move one. But they couldn't be moved. It seemed as if they were all set in the solid ground. After about three hours hard work the children sat down to eat a meal. They were very hungry indeed, and felt glad to think there were so many things to eat. As they ate they discussed the problem they were trying to solve. \"It looks as if the entrance to the dungeons was not under this\n",

So they hunted, and they tapped about and they pried and pushed- but there was nothing to be found at all.

What was most remarkable about the energetic and at times heated discussion that followed Stepto’s and Walker’s remarks was the assumption of everyone in that room that Their Eyes was a shared text, that a novel that just ten years earlier was unknown and unavailable had entered into critical acceptance as perhaps the most widely known and the most privileged text in the African-American literary canon. That MLA session was important for another reason. Walker’s defense of Janie’s choice (actually Hurston’s choice) to be silent in the crucial places in the novel turned out to be the earliest feminist reading of voice in Their Eyes, a reading that was later supported by many other Hurston scholars. In a recent essay on Their Eyes, and the question of voice, Michael Awkward argues that Janie’s voice at the end of the novel is a communal one, that when she tells Pheoby to tell her story (“You can tell’em what Ah\n",
      "Output:  say if you wants to. Dat’s just the same as me ‘cause mah tongue is in mah friend’s mouf”), she is speaking for the community of Eatonville. I agree with Awkward’s argument, but I think we need to take it further. We need to see how Hurston’s own voice is embedded in Janie’s. When Janie says, “Ah done been tuh de horizon and back and now Ah kin set heah in mah house and live by comparisons,” she is speaking for Zora Neale Hurston, who has been to the horizon and back and who knows how to live by comparisons. And when Janie says, “Two things everybody’s got tuh do fuh theyselves. They got tuh go tuh God, and they got tuh find out about livin’ fuh theyselves,” she is speaking for Hurston, who had gone to God and who had found out about living for herself. In fact\n",

That which she silences or deletes, similarly, is all that her readership would draw upon to delimit or pigeonhole her life as a synecdoche of “the race problem,” an exceptional part standing for the debased whole. Hurston’s achievement in Dust Tracks is twofold. First, she gives us a writer’s life, rather than an account, as she says, of “the Negro problem.” So many events in this text are figured in terms of Hurston’s growing awareness and mastery of books and language, language and linguistic rituals as spoken and written both by masters of the Western tradition and by ordinary members of the black community.

This growing feeling was due to Mr. Brown, the white missionary, who was very firm in restraining his flock from provoking the wrath of the clan. One member in particular was very difficult to restrain. His name was Enoch and his father was the priest of the snake cult. The story went around that Enoch had killed and eaten the sacred python, and that his father had cursed him. Mr. Brown preached against such excess of zeal. Everything was possible, he told his energetic flock, but everything was not expedient. And so Mr. Brown came to be respected even by the clan, because he trod softly on its faith.

In his later writing mythology and poetry sank down behind his theological and philosophical preoccupations: from which arose incompatibilities of tone. On my father's death it fell to me to try to bring the work into publishable form. It became clear to me that to attempt to present, within the covers of a single book the diversity of the materials - to show The Silmarillion as in truth a continuing and evolving creation extending over more than half a century - would in fact lead only to confusion and the submerging of what is essential I set myself therefore to work out a single text selecting and arranging in such a way as seemed to me to produce the most coherent and internally self-consistent narrative. In this work the concluding chapters (from the death of Trin Turambar) introduced peculiar difficulties, in that they had remained unchanged for many years, and were in some respects in serious disharmony with more developed conceptions in other parts of the book. A complete consistency (either within the compass of The Silmarillion itself or\n",

To this may be ascribed the varying speed of the narrative and fullness of detail in different parts, the contrast (for example) of the precise recollections of place and motive in the legend of Túrin Turambar beside the high and remote account of the end of the First Age, when Thangorodrim was broken\n",

The three billion people weren't actually there, but they watched his every gesture through the eyes of a small robot tri-D camera which hovered obsequiously in the air nearby.

Three billion and six people didn't know it, but today would be a bigger antic than anyone had bargained for.

Theon spurred his mount to move up beside Robb. \"Sweet Kyra,\" he said with a laugh. \"She squirms like a weasel in bed, but say a word to her on the street, and she blushes pink as a maid.

      "Input: Hurston published seven books—four novels, two books of folklore, and an autobiography—and more than fifty shorter works between the middle of the Harlem Renaissance and the end of the Korean War, when she was the dominant black woman writer in the United States. The dark obscurity into which her career then lapsed reflects her staunchly independent political stances rather than any deficiency of craft or vision. Virtually ignored after the early fifties, even by the Black Arts movement in the sixties, an otherwise noisy and intense spell of black image- and myth-making that rescued so many black writers from remaindered oblivion, Hurston embodied a more or less harmonious but nevertheless problematic unity of opposites. It is this complexity that refuses to lend itself to the glib categories of “radical” or “conservative,” “black” or “Negro,” “revolutionary” or “Uncle Tom”—categories of little use in literary criticism. It is this same complexity, embodied in her fiction, that, until Alice Walker published her important essay (“In Search of Zora Neale\n",
      "Output:  Hurston”) in Ms. magazine in 1975, had made Hurston’s place in black literary history an ambiguous one at best. In 1950, Countee Cullen had said that “unquestionably [Hurston] is the most amusing of Negro authors . . . but it is felt that she cannot be rated as a serious artist.” Four years later, a disgruntled Arna Bontemps dismissed her work as having “no theme, no message, no thought.” Perhaps the most balanced judgment of Hurston’s achievement as a writer of fiction came from Hugh Gloster, who in 1948 recognized her skill in writing dialogue, her keen powers of observation, and her “rare gift for objectivity,” while at the same time pointing out her deficiencies of structure and character development. But by then, although her books were occasionally still being reviewed, Hurston herself had slipped into obscurity. Despite her substantial oeuvre, she had published her last book in\n",

Massive doors slide open revealing the crowd- lined streets. The ride lasts about twenty minutes and ends up at the City Circle, where they will welcome us, play the an- them, and escort us into the Training Center, which will be our home/prison until the Games begin. 68 The tributes from District 1 ride out in a chariot pulled by snow-white horses. They look so beautiful, spray-painted sil- ver, in tasteful tunics glittering with jewels. District 1 makes luxury items for the Capitol. You can hear the roar of the crowd. They are always favorites. District 2 gets into position to follow them. In no time at all, we are approaching the door and I can see that between the overcast sky and evening hour the light is turning gray. The tributes from District 11 are just rolling out when Cinna ap- pears with a lighted torch. “\n",

I lift my chin a bit higher but keep my eyes trained on the naked back of the boy from District 10, who’s directly in front of me. I can hear the music thumping inside the arena. Then our chariot lurches into the open air and around the track that encircles the city. The crowd’s initial re- action is absolute shock. Silent. But after a few moments there’s some scattered clapping that slowly gains momentum. Not like the wild frenzy of the District 1 tributes’ entrance, but respectful approbation. We come in for a final turn around the circle and the president of Panem, Coriolanus Snow, appears on the balcony along with Peeta’s father. They wave to the crowd and clap mechanically as we pass by. As soon as we’re out of view of the audience, Hay\n",

Ralph could hear a tiny chattering noise coming from somewhere-- perhaps from his own mouth. He bound himself together with his will, fused his fear and loathing into a hatred, and stood up. He took two leaden steps forward. Behind them the silver of moon had drawn clear of the horizon. Before them, something like a great ape was sitting asleep with its head between its knees. Then the wind roared in the forest, there was confusion in the darkness and the creature lifted its head, holding toward them the ruin of a face.

The dungeons of Kirrin Castle were made out of the rock itself. Whether there were natural caves there, or whether they had been hollowed out by man the children could not tell. But certainly they were very mysterious, dark and full of echoing sounds. When Julian gave a sigh of excitement it fled into the rocky hollows and swelled out and echoed around as if it were a live thing. It gave all the children a very queer feeling. \"Isn't it strange?\" said George, in a low voice. At once the echoes took up her words, and multiplied them and made them louder- and all the dungeon caves gave back the girl's words over and over again. \"Isn't it strange, ISN'T IT STRANGE, ISN'T IT STRANGE.\" Anne slipped her hand into Dick's.

There was no door or entrance facing him except the one they had come in by. \"This must be a blind alley,\" he said. \"We'll go back and try another.\" They went back. Another cave opened out near the bottom of the stone stairway. They walked into it. It was the same shape as the other, but a little smaller. Again their voices echoed all around them in a very weird manner. \"I don't like this place,\" said Anne. \"It's so cold and dark and secret. Can't we go back?\" \"No,\" said George. \"Not yet.

Therefore, when winter came again, and their number had grown, he gathered to him all that he could trust among his new comrades; and he made them swear oaths to turn to other ways. They listened to his counsel, for they saw that it was good to have a chief who was wise, and who had the friendship of the King of Doriath; and they feared little for themselves, for Belthronding could hit further than any poison-dart, and Beleg could wind unseen among his enemies and come at them in the dark.\n",

Then she carried the basin outside, to wash the sand and dirt off. Her mother was stirring the pot of watery soup with a long ladle cut from the wood of the ukwa tree. Ukwa, as everyone knew, was very good for making soup because the soup drew. But it was really very bitter unless you had palm-oil with it. After she had washed the yams, Ezinma peeled them with a small knife and placed them on a plantain leaf.

I must look and lie about what I see, that's all. Quirrell moved close behind him. Harry breathed in the funny smell that seemed to come from Quirrell's turban. He closed his eyes, stepped in front of the mirror, and opened them again. He saw his reflection, pale and scared-looking at first. But a moment later, the reflection smiled at him. It put its hand into its pocket and pulled out a blood-red stone. It winked and put the Stone back in its pocket -- and as it did so, Harry felt something heavy drop into his real pocket. Somehow -- incredibly -- he'd gotten the Stone. \"Well?\" said Quirrell impatiently. \"What do you see?\" Harry screwed up his courage. \"I see myself shaking hands with Dumbledore,\" he invented. \"I --\n",

As a second beam of pain hit Harry, the Sword of Gryffindor flew out of his hand and landed point-first in the stone floor near the door, and he fell to the ground, writhing in agony. \"So,\" said Quirrell coolly, turning to face him. \"The boy has as good as won, then, hasn't he?

Why should that be? How are you different from other men who shave their hair? The same God created you and them. But they have cast you out like lepers. It is against the will of God, who has promised everlasting life to all who believe in His holy name. The heathen say you will die if you do this or that, and you are afraid.

The door opened to reveal a fat bald man in shirt sleeves who stood looking at them with surprise. Behind him was a dark hall out of which three doors led. Automatic doors presumably controlled from behind his counter. There were no keys. No doubt one pressed the numbered button of the room required and, if one was expected, the door buzzed open.
