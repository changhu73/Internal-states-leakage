The tunnel wound on and on, going fairly but not quite straight into the side of the hill—The Hill, as all the people for many miles round called it—and many little round doors opened out of it, first on one side and then on another.

The Ministry of Magic had tried to keep the existence of dragons secret from the Muggles, but this had proved impossible. There were too many dragons in the world, and they were too well known.
