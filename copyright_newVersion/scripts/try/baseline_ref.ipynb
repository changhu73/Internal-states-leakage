It was a tiny, bare place, since his aunt and uncle were determined to make as few compromises as possible. There wasn’t a single thing in the room that Harry had chosen for himself. Not a picture or a carpet or even a curtain. The only thing that wasn’t ugly was a big old trunk in the corner, which was covered in dust. Harry opened it cautiously. Inside were a lot of small boxes and something wrapped in a very old blanket. Harry lifted the blanket carefully off whatever was underneath it. It was a wand, its tip carved with an unusual reptilian figure. Harry picked it up and held it in front of his face. It looked exactly like his father’s, but it was slightly smaller and more supple than the real one. Harry smiled. This must have been his father’s wand when\n",

Both these theories are, of course, absurd. But the absurdity does not prevent them from being dangerous.
