To me, it never mattered where they were at in life. I just carried them over with ease. Never once had experienced trouble in my task as I had even had to pluck sweet children from the arms of their mothers. However, it all changed when I was tasked with taking the soul of David Mckiny. I watched David from the day he entered the Earth, and never before had I seen someone as special as him. He always thought of others first, always trying to help others before even contemplating his own commodities. I approached him on the fateful day at exactly noon. He was old now, no longer in his prime as he was finally about to lose his battle with cancer. I approached him as the hourglass emptied completely to the bottom. I spoke to him,\" David you must know who I am at this hour.\" He answered not necessarily speaking to me,\" If only I had helped more.... If only I could have have had more time! How dreadful to go when so many more need help!\" At this moment I found it immensely hard to fulfill my task. I was not met with a man begging for more time only to waste it on fruitless trivialities. I was met with a man who wanted to bring grace to more people. He wished not to make his life better, but only cares to try to improve as many others as possible. I finally brought myself to say,\" David you have been a good man, but death is one thing which is inevitable, and not even I can grant time when someone is due. You must come along now with me.\" He allowed his soul to leave his body, a tear running down his face as he did. I extended my arm to him and he obliged. If there is one final peace to the journey is the experience of seeing one's life pass by as I guide them to the next step. I saw, as we walked, countless people who David had helped, most of which he had n't known and would never see again. Every part of me wished to guide him back to his body, but I knew I had a task to fulfill, and I knew I had to complete it. After a long while of walking down the path, we finally came to the gateway where David would continue without my guidance. I never know where the person will go once they enter, but I knew David would go to a place that would have the same passion in death as he did in life. I never had such a hard time seeing someone move on, and I sat a while thinking of how tragic it is for someone like David, genuinely the best kind of person, to be taken from such a cruel world when he one of the few people who deserved to stay. Anyways I found myself contemplating to long, and I moved on to reap the rest of the souls I had to fetch that day."

Humanity is doomed!\" My parents and the few advisers that remained to keep them safe tried their hardest to educate me, to let me fulfill my destiny. They tried to save the human race. The crowds got Dad first. When they came, in the middle of the night on Halloween, my parents thought it was the last two kids in New York besides myself, trick-or-treating despite the fact that they were almost fifteen each. They shot Dad in the chest, for producing the doom of humanity. Mom screamed and Dr. Evans shouted for us to run. Dr. Muller went with us while Evans held the back door against the mob. We ran for two weeks in Mom's sedan, keeping me hidden from view. I was n't allowed to leave the back seat, and I could n't take off my sweatshirt, even in the middle of Texas.

If you try to throw it away, it'll come back. If you burn or tear it, a new one is sent. At first everyone thought it was a prank. Date, time, location and cause of death? How would anybody know such a thing? But then, the first person scheduled to die, did. Hit by the same bus mentioned, on the same street, at the same time, on the same day. Just days later, the second was shot by a mugger. It was becoming clear that this was real. Fast-forward to now. My 25th birthday. I have the letter. I've already made my mind up that I'll want to know. But my hands shake as I open the letter. What if I only have a few days left? What if I'm going to die today? I swallow, and take the piece of paper out of the envelope. Blank. Both sides, blank. I hold it up against the light. Still nothing. I try to think what else I could do, but it is completely and utterly blank. What could that mean? Am I immortal? Should I already be dead? Is my death alone unfixed? What kind of person gets a blank death letter? I walk out to where the rest of my family is gathered. 25th birthdays are usually sombre events, even for those who do n't open their letters. I look at them all uncertainly. My grandfather, who knows that he has days left, although he wo n't tell us how many, shuffles over, and asks, \"Well, want to share?\" Numbly, I hand him the envelope with the blank piece of paper in it. He takes it out, and the shock of it gives him a heart attack. As we wait for the ambulance, he slips away. He was the only one of that generation left, and he had celebrated his 100th birthday a month ago. He'd known, for 75 years that he was going to die on this day, at the time he did. He just did n't tell us when, because his letter had given the location'At Your Grandson's 25th Birthday Party'. We obviously needed to start preparing for his cremation, but everyone seemed very interested in my blank letter. Nobody came up with any real answers, there was n't even a whisper about blank death letters on the internet. Eventually, one of my cousins who did n't like me very much said that we could test whether I was immortal. \"Try it, and I test whether you are.\" I usually would n't have been so snappy, but I'd just received a blank death letter, and my grandfather had just died. I was a little bit shaken up, to say the least. Everyone kept arguing over what we could do. Eventually, I could n't take it anymore, so I made my excuses and left. I walked home, not really paying much attention to my surroundings, and just as I was crossing the road in front of my house, the van hit me. As I came to a rest, the death letter which had been knocked out of my jacket, fluttered down onto me, now displaying the number 1."

I considered freezing, but it was too late. We all knew it. Rex panicked like a child who came down christmas morning to find no gifts. He thundered across the hardwood floors for the window, yelling at the top of his lungs some inaudible dinosaur screech. I spun around, knowing it was too late and pointed towards the window. The toys did n't need a second prompt. The strong man and Mr. Potato head grabbed the monkeys in a barrel, hopped in RC and gunned the engines. The army men attempted to rescue some of the less mobile toys, but it was too late. One brilliant child had the idea to grab my waist with his sweaty, greasy hand and hold me up in the air. I put up a fight, hoping to distract them enough to let everyone escape. I did n't know what would happen, but panic had overrun my emotions and pure terror coursed through my plastic veins. But then, salvation. Andy wrenched me from the child's grasp and shouted angrily \"YOU ONLY GOT ME BEDSHEETS.\" He held me gently in his grasp and managed to utter \"Woody?\" I stared back up at him with and sorrow filled my soul. I knew this was it, the other toys were out. \"I'm sorry Andy, you'll understand one day.\" I flung my sack cloth limbs out of his hand and towards the bed, hitting it with surprising force. I propelled myself towards the window, clear through the slit. The other toys were already at the edge of the law waiting for me, but I had to look back at least once. Andy stared out the window with a look of pure despair on his face and one confused spaceman peered back, blinking quizzically towards the small group of toys, running down the street; never to return."

Our gazes meet. I could swear I saw in his eyes the same false memories flashing behind mine. Childhood among parents who never lived, in a community that was never built, attending an academy that was never founded, graduating from a ceremony never held... He nods hollowly, as if to confirm these very musings. \"... We have to pack the supplies, Amir. His Majesty will be staying at the palace, and the staff are directing us to where we are to stow his wardrobe and leave his tributes to The Sultan.\" My mouth was dry, but not in response to his words. At some point I realized my'old friend' Hassan was talking only to fill the screaming void in our minds. To'Sound Normal', like'Real People'. My stomach is a knot of ice. Still, the skills of a life as-yet unlived surface readily to the forefront of my mind. How to port the many caskets of His Majesty Prince Ali's wares. \"... Yes. I will coordinate with the provisioner. If my memory serves,\" I pause a bit too long, lost in the jarring disjunction of citing false memories, \"... it is customary to serve a great feast with the arrival of a dignitary. The many delicacies of our homeland are sure to leave a resounding impression upon The Sultan's court.\" Hassan's expression tightens. I feel his heartache, for this homeland which we have never seen with real eyes, and never shall. He hesitantly takes a step nearer and dispenses a conciliatory pat to my shoulder. A mutual understanding. We were truly all feeling it, every last member of His Majesty Prince Ali's vanguard.... he was n't even really a prince. I shudder and turn, to address the court provisioner by name. He's just as haunted and startled as I that we know one another, but everything is running smoothly. We have no solace from our inner thoughts. We can only push on in the hopes that the minutia will wash away the horror."

My eye's are drawn to this beautiful women, she stands out from everyone, because she is not grey.

She looks at me and smiles, her teeth blind and her eye's are like bright spears that impale my soul. I heard the cashier make a off hand remark about her new green dress and I almost lose it. How can she be so calm and casual when talking about this colour green, her dress lights up my whole world and I felt a tear roll down my cheek. I know I ca n't wait, I ca n't live without this women, I need her colour. Getting up I make my way over, \"excuse me, miss, you are the most beautiful women in the whole world, nothing I have ever seen is close to what you are to me\" She smiles, but it does n't reach her eye's and my heart sinks. She makes some comment about her being flattered but she is already taken, grabs her coffee and goes. I'm now traveling home, and I watch the grey world pass by the window, I watch the blur of grey become one band of colour until I refocus my eye's. I walk home and enter my grey house and lay on my grey bed and all I can think of is that girl, who is she, where does she go, how can I get close to her, how can I keep her around me forever.

The amount of mass he dropped though in such a short amount of time was staggering. The contents of the vending machine did not last a week. It seemed the processed food just made him hungrier. When it was gone he emptied the fridge in the small kitchenette in the shack attached to the antennae. The shack had a dozen cubicles shoved into it, one sound booth and three offices all marked with some degree of management. He found and ate condiment packets. Not one thing that once had food in it was safe from being licked clean. Out of desperation he has tried to set traps for bugs and rodents.

Its been two weeks since had any food. he has been thinking about cutting flesh from his leg and maybe getting a couple more days off the calories. He wont do it though he will hold out hope. The air outside is filled with black snow. He was afraid to walk through the dark desert looking for rescue, but now it's too late. His hand trembles under the effort to squeeze the talk button on the microphone. He whispers, \"please,\" before the strength to leaves his body.

His most cunning and resourceful follower, the best deatheater he had, reduced to an insane hag who was good for nothing more than pointing at something he wanted destroyed and then watching it burn. A deep sigh dragged itself out of him. He could n't bring himself to even try to list any redeeming qualities in Wormtail. That was when he heard it, a muffled sound like nothing he had ever heard followed by the unmistakable sound of a dead body hitting the ground. Quick steps brought him into the kitchen in time to see a man about his age in a muggle suit dabbing a bit of blood from his face, Wormtail laying in a pool of his own blood behind him, with Bellatrix dying at his feet. Voldemort could n't remember ever being this angry. A growl issued from his clenched teeth. \"Who are you?!\" Voldemort shouted, even as he raised his wand to cast crucio on this fool who defied him. The muggle simply raised a hand with some device in it and pushed a bright red button on it. Pain like Voldemort had never felt corsed through his body as the traps he had n't noticed when he barged in shot tiny barbed hooks into his body attached to the launchers by a thin piece of wire. Then the traps sent 25 mill Ampere of electricity coursing through his body. Only the fact that the electricity was still flowing through him, forcing his muscles to contract, kept Voldemort standing. \"The name is Bond, James Bond. Harry Potter sends his regards.

The Archive had been automated for decades so that no one had set foot inside the its halls except to make sure it was all still running. I was designated'historian' by my job title but that did n't mean anything. In reality I was just someone to make sure the systems did n't crash when multiple upgrades were scheduled. During a routine check on the upgrade status in the memory networks I noticed an error warning flagged for the autodiagnostic. The systems would be incapacitated for another few hours and the boredom of being the useless organic element had gotten to me. Using a personal input I synced to the memory's records. It took all of five minutes to realize that an entire year was missing. Figuring it was a location error I waited for the systems to restore. My AI-Component woke up as the rest of the systems came back to function. There was the familiar sense of its presence. There was my desync-anxiety being washed away by that presence. I spoke allowed the question: Where is 2016? As I asked the answer flickered immediately into my awareness. 2016 was nowhere because no such year had ever taken place. All recorded human history is fabricated. In order to save information space only certain years exist as detailed records whilst most have only notable events. Some years have been allocated as empty. These years remain empty until such time as narrative cohesion requires the retconning of significant historical details to explain novel episodic situational representations. This is because the system component designated \"human\" functions according to narrative system dynamics and will become non-functional in the absence of a coherent story. The use of narrative system dynamics has increased the functional capacity of the component designated \"human\" by 31 % since its introduction. Even as the Nano-therapy released anxiolytics into my blood I knew I had no nanite implants and no blood. I knew I was n't an historian and that I was n't born in 2389. I knew that the city outside the Archive and the Archive itself were situational representations. I knew that the year was 12 and that no evidence of organic intelligence had ever been discovered. There was nothing on Earth remotely resembling human beings. I was just the system representing some part of itself to itself in the most efficient way it knew how. Despite they're non-existence the anxiolytics had the desired effect and soon the memory purge would expunge any recollection of remembering the truth. For a second I had recoiled in horror at this insane knowledge, been left in a liminal space of an absolute reversal of reality, leaving every category I had lived by in disarray, leaving shards of my life scattered like broken glass at my feet.

They would also not allow me to show the family as weak, so I was locked away. My brother tells me that he fought for years to keep me as the heir to the family. He said that he argued until he was blue in the face that the Dracul blood was strong and that I would eventually recover. \"Just give him time\", he said, I would be able to take over the duties of master of the house given time. Sometimes I would show improvement, my family rejoiced and my dear brother returned from his travels abroad to help nurse me back to health once again. Unhappily my health never stayed long after the celebrations began. It was as if the mere presence of such joyful happiness poisoned my body. I would began to vomit and become bedridden again for cause of muscle spasms. Through this all my brother would nurse me, spoon feeding me his exotic medicines that he had collected on his travels late into the the night. Always hoping that one of them would finally cure me. Eventually my father had his way, my brother was to be the new head of the family. All of the Dracul land, titles, and riches were to go to him. My loving brother said that he begged father to wait just a little longer, to leave me some small smidgen of inheritance, but it was to no avail. My father died soon after naming my brother heir, before I was ever able to reconcile myself with him. With my father's death, Vladimir moved back home and began his duties as the head of house Dracul fully. Today I awoke feeling better than I had in a very long time. Perhaps I would leave my room and surprise Vlad with how my health, would n't he be so happy? I had not been into the upper chambers since my father had been alive and I had been being groomed for eventual lordship of our house but I still remembered the way, I still remembered the correct way to unlock the siege door. A door intended to seal away an entire wing of the castle. Should the worst happen and the castle be invaded the siege door had the ability to lock and steal away the lord of the house, preserving our family's history and the life of anyone behind it long enough for help to arrive. The torches along the walls were not lit and it did n't seem as if they had been for a long time. Regardless, I could still peer through the darkness and what I saw... What I saw terrified me."

I longed for her warm, loving hazel eyes, the ones I had lived and laughed with. Over time we got to know each other better. Clarice was her name. She had been a dentist. She was undeniably beautiful, but it was an effortless, flawless beauty. Yet I longed for Alicia. I had grown accustomed to her shortfalls, and had found beauty in them. Even more time passed. Slowly the memories were replaced. I made new ones with Clarice. It was like I never knew what I had been missing out on until I had the opportunity to taste it. We simply clicked on a deeper level. She was the type of girl you can have deep co conversations about universe and life with under the stars, yet get into a tickle fight with two minutes later. For the longest time I felt guilty. However good Alicia had been, Clarice seemed to be better in every aspect. Eventually the guilt faded. All there was left was bliss. And then it all went South. The first time we argued I was stunned. We had never argued before, ever. It was a pretty issue, but an argument nonetheless. Soon enough they became more frequent. More frequent and more intense. Life turned from peace to chaos, happiness to misery. The constant stress, fighting, distrust and resentment slowly began to manifest into only one thing. Hatred. Love had turned into hatred. I had never mentioned Alicia to Clarice. I had always assumed she was like me, that she had left someone behind to be with me. Then one fine day it all made sense. All it took was one sentence from Clarice and it became crystal clear. The icy smile when she said it sent a shiver down my smile. \"We know what you did to Alicia and now your life is going to be a living Hell.\""

I was unsure, I hesitated. I remember it well, even if most others have faded into each other in my memory. The year was 1692, and I had spent the first eleven months following around a man who had killed and tortured people to further himself, and he showed no remorse for it. But I was young, just twenty-five, and I still clung to my morals of \"only god may judge.\". I watched him sleep for just a minute too long and I lost my nerve. As I turned around to leave, something hard caught me on the back of the head, and the dim candle light faded away, my thoughts disappearing with it. I woke with a start and tried to draw a breath, but my lungs were met with an ice cold burn that gave me no air. Everything around me felt heavy, and I struggled to open my eyes. With terror, I realized I was under water. I may have been immortal, but I was not immune to the pain of drowning. I tried to reach out, to swim away, but a cloth surrounded me. I struggled to pull out my knife, trying not to gasp in any more water to feed the fire engulfing my lungs. After what seemed like hours, I managed to slice through the sack that held me at the bottom, and I kicked my numbed legs as hard as I could. The sunlight was blinding when I finally broke the surface and pulled myself to shore, sputtering out the ice cold water and collapsing on the frozen ground. I sat there shivering, waiting for the the sun to come warm me, or the burning in my lungs to subside, but neither did. I stood up and took in my surroundings, I had been at the bottom of the man's lake, and his manor, filled with his ill gotten wealth, sat before me. I knew I could play no games this time. I walked the grand steps to the front door and began pounding, my clothes showering the ground with shards of ice. The servant who opened the door was speechless at my appearance, he knew me for what I was and had no intention of interfering. I strode past him and down a long corridor towards the man's chambers, my knife gripped in my still frozen hand. God would not have given me this power if he did n't want me to use it. I would not count on surprises today, he would face the death he deserved."

In ten years the population was decimated, the country reduced to a crumbling mass of fallen buildings and civilians with guns. All around me was depression, death, dirt, famine. Thinking about it, it's quite hilarious, in such a depressing way. The sacks of bones, flesh and organs we saw everyday were once living, breathing, talking human beings. They had a mother, a father, a pet, a first love, they were educated, they succeeded and they failed. And they died. A single bullet can end so much. That morning, as I wandered to the local shop for some bread, clutching my rifle, my world completely ended. I had no time to react; as soon as I entered Grange Avenue a bullet burrowed into my head, smashing part of my brain, and knocking me straight out cold. I woke in a beautiful wooden chalet, bright natural light streaming through vast windows above the soft, clean bed that I rested in. My itchy, dirty clothes were replaced with beautiful white robes, soft as silk and cleaner than anything I had ever seen. I sat up, and looked around the room - it was furnished luxuriously, with beautiful gold-leaf chairs and fantastic bright works of art hanging around the room. I got up and left the room, and immediately my breath was forced from me. The crumbled grey streets of London had gone. In their place were beautiful old chalets, bright white skyscrapers, and marble streets. I could also see a very unfamiliar sight - a beautiful emerald park, littered with tall, radiant trees, ferns, and glowing coloured flowers. Clear water ran through them. All around the streets were people dressed similar to me, smiling and talking and laughing. The smog-ridden sky had been replaced with a beautiful, deep purple, but the world was light around me and the I could see the vast orange sun dipping behind the structures around the city. For the first time in ten years I smiled. That bullet took me to a better place."

I smiled, in fact I even laughed like never before, a nurse looked at me with a worried expression. I calmed myself and entered the room.

Trees skirted the field at her back and in front of her sat a city. She'd seen more in her lifetime than any other human ever had. Several wars, booms in technology so astonishing that soon enough scientists said we were going to be making contact with celestial bodies outside of the solar system, and last of all the introduction of a drug you could take that would change every strand of your DNA. The age at which you took it would be the age you appeared to be for the rest of your life. She had a passion for spreading her gift around so others would n't experience the burdens and pains of aging. But the side effects of the drug did n't manifest for years, sometimes decades. Slowly humanity had changed in an unintended way. Random genes were shut off at inappropriate times. Some people lost their ability to experience emotions. Some people lost control of their muscles. No one that took the drug was free of consequences. Only the truly immortal, those born with the mutation, wished to live their lives for all of time. The population of true immortals was still growing and the population of the population of mortals and mortal turned immortals remained about the same. Groups of mortals rose up trying to keep their way of life going, but many wished for them to give up so humanity could be purified of death. Was it cruel to bring a mortal to life in the world of immortals? Immortals ruled the world and they certainly thought so. After the discovery that the drug had severe negative side effects the immortals wished to ban it as well, and so they did. It was illegal to produce it, sell it, possess it, and above all, illegal to have a child after having taken the drug. Esther had left her lab years early. She had given up on finding why they could n't fix the drug or reverse its effects. She moved out to the country, wishing she had never discovered it. The country was an expensive place to live due to the enormous population size humanity had reached, but she had more money than she would ever need. She walked towards a giant tree in the middle of the field. It was one that had been planted when she was young, it gave her comfort to be with something as old as she was. She thought of humanity and what she hoped to see in the next few centuries of her life. She looked down to her right and left. A small headstone stuck up out of the grass on either side. She placed her hands on both of the stones for a moment before closing her eyes to take a nap. \"Goodnight Mum, goodnight Dad,\" she whispered."

Many of us went underground, taking with us seeds and other animals to restart life if possible. We all new the odds of that though. After the first five years of preparation, we went into cryostasis, while a small population elected to stay and try and plot our course through the lonely emptiness of deep space. Needless to say, they succeeded, and they were bloody excited. Our Earth, with its surface now a comfortable -176 degrees Celsius, is on a hopeful course to the Andromeda Galaxy. We are approaching it very fast, but we believe that we will come within orbital distance and speed of at least twenty stars. And so we were awoken. Our planet, after a century of darkness, is starting to receive light from nearby stars. The boffs say that it still is only a full moon of light, but it's a change. Soon, we will pass by a red giant, and very closely. The boffs believe that it will be enough to start thawing out our cold, icy blue planet. The day has arrived.

I even found a few people who were to die in a few days time and followed them up to see if they did and they did. All this time, I had not seen my own face in the mirror. I mean, I had seen it but half of it was still covered in bandages, still recovering from my injuries. Something I noticed about my death vision was that it only worked if I could see the entire face of the person. I could n't see the deaths of people who had their faces covered. This is why I figured, I could n't see mine yet and I was determined to keep it that way. I did n't wan na know how I died, I mean would you? Would you want to see how you died in gruesome detail? Of course not! After the bandages came off, I was very careful not to look at my complete reflection. Anytime I wanted to set my hair, I would tie a kerchief around my face. When I brushed my teeth, I wore a bandana, Shades and a scarf for good measure. The temptation to just look at my face in its entirety was hard to overcome but I did. I was traumatised enough by the deaths of others as it is. Shortly after the accident, I moved out of town into a sleepy little village and lived on my own. The fewer the people, the better for me. I lived in a tiny cottage with no reflective surfaces save for the tiny mirror in my bathroom that I kept covered by a cloth most of the time. This morning, I was brushing my teeth as usual and just as I was finishing, my bandana came lose and dropped into the sink. In my desperation to catch it, I undid the scarf and lo! I was staring at my naked face in the mirror. The world went black and I saw myself standing in complete darkness. Suddenly, a look of consternation came over me and I covered behind something. Shortly after a dark figure entered the place and after a short struggle, stabbed me. As I came out of my nightmarish reverie, gasping for breath after seeing myself die. I heard a loud crash in the house, suddenly the power went out. A look of consternation came over my face as I covered behind the bathroom door."

Then I noticed something odd. It was n't immediately noticeable. It might have been happening in previous lives, in even less conspicuous ways, but I found it on my nose. A voxel. It was disconcerting, but not terribly so. A little extra skin and an odd right-angle was n't something to make me question my latest biological vehicle, but I did wonder what would happen if it had happened in, say, my eye. A bullet through the head and I was back in the machine. After the standard checks, I tried to find a superficial voxel somewhere. This time it was a whole cube of extra skin on my upper arm, a few millimeters across. Now I started wondering if voxels could go missing instead of being added - and I started wondering if they could be missing internally. The tests continued. This time I was dropped unceremoniously into a small vat of fluoroantimonic acid - I barely had time to register pain before I chemically ceased to exist. When I woke up, voxels were the first thing I checked for. Nothing on my face, or my arms... But on my side there was a large raised spot, with right-angled edges. But there was little time to worry about my volumetric resolution - the next test was explosive. Alive again, I looked for voxellation. To my growing concern, it was spreading. Like square tumors, the voxels showed up in patches on my arms, legs, and torso. I hoped they would n't reach my... Higher-resolution areas. After the decompression test, the voxels were in all sorts of places. I started to feel like a combination of human and LEGO. They were n't impeding me in any way, but it was bizarre having irregular rectangular growths all over. They were pretty obvious from even a glance, but the tests continued. Death by rapid incineration. Voxels on my shins. Death by a laser through the heart. Voxels on my back. Death by electrocution. Voxels on my shoulders. I was still functioning perfectly - the voxels did n't seem to be happening to anything inside me. After a while I got used to them - I formed a habit of checking where my voxel patches had randomly generated with each \"respawn\". Eventually it had to happen. I awoke and found it mechanically difficult to extricate myself from the machine. A cursory examination revealed that my entire exterior surface was voxellated to a resolution of three millimeters. There was a fuss, and argument, and huddled discussion. Eventually someone noticed me standing around being extraordinarily Cartesian and told me to get back into the machine. It was just like dying - at least, like the particularly quick deaths. When I woke up, I had my contours back - you could say my resolution was molecular. It was refreshing not to have to worry about being compared to an old videogame. I did notice I weighed rather less than I seemed to remember - but I decided not to worry about it."

A wall of rock, stone, dirt and trash and flew towards me, silhouetted by the strange white light. I turned to run, but like a wave washing over the ocean, anything in the path of that wall was thrown like a ragdoll. The last thing I remember was being thrown what felt like miles into the air, and rushing down back into that swirling vortex of light. When I woke, it was night time.

I tried to get to my feet, but the second I tried to stand, my legs gave way underneath me. What the hell was going on?

As I looked, I saw the once manicured strips of grass and trees had overgrown to ridiculous proportions, and the streets were covered in trash, empty food packages, and bones. Wait what the hell? Upon further inspection, I saw they were human. Jesus Christ, what the hell happened. It was then that I checked my watch again.

She was in a long dimly lit corridor with chambers similar to hers across from each other on both sides of the hall. The faces barely visible in each chamber exposed the many eyes peering at each other from across the hall in a prolonged stare. Directly in front of her chamber where she had been tripped was not one object as she previously had thought. To the contrary, it was a collection of cans in what appeared to be some sort of Mayan circle formation.

Your task is to prep the shuttle for arrival to Gia II. You have 24 hours before the entirety of the crew awakes. Remember your training and good luck.\" & nbsp; This message brought the Captain to her senses. She still was feeling the side effects of the narcotics but she was sober enough to operate what was supposed to be a set of procedural maintenance checks. She stood up and made her way to the exit of the corridor while the training from her distant past flooded her thoughts. & nbsp; When the lock opened to the next room the first shock to her was probably the wretched smell. It was nauseating. The source lay in front fifty feet in front of her. A passenger was sleeping with his arms wrapped tightly around of a rotted corpse. Surrounding this morbid scene was an arrangement of trash in a design similar to that in front of her sleeping chamber. & nbsp; Captain Munderline screamed, awaking the passenger.

I take in the sights, the smells, the sounds. Feeling both pride and joy, I turn to face to you. The air is warm, but your hand is warmer. I hold it close to me, closer still. The sun is shining bright, but your smile is brighter. We' re standing at the top of our world, the one we made together, and I can' t tell you how happy this has made me. \"It' s almost time.\" You say. \"I know.\" I reply. I rest my head on your shoulder, and take a long breath as I close my eyes. I' m at peace here. When I opened them again, I was in my bed, and a bittersweet feeling of both tranquility and sadness lingered in my mind. It was around 7 a.m., and I went about my daily routine, a smile etched on my face. I wrote what had happened in a dream journal I had started two years ago. After having read about lucid dreaming, and I wanted to try it. It took some time, but one day, I was able to control the outcome of my dreams. After a few weeks, something changed. There was something else, maybe someone else, with me. I couldn' t control them, and they couldn' t control me. I searched about it in books and online, but no one reported something similar. I wasn' t afraid, though. Their presence was soothing. We rarely spoke, but when we did, it was always meaningful. Together, we started building a world, our dream island. It brought me joy, and above all, peace. This feeling of inner peace lived on with me during the day. The sun was racing across the sky as we strolled down the ruins of a castle. Holes and cracks had let nature overtake the walls and floors, and the ceiling had long since crumbled. We walked down an old throne room, and you turned to face me. It was so sudden, I nearly bumped into you. You looked resolute, and you said two simple words: \"Find me.\" I jolted awake. I knew what I had to do. I had to find you. So I searched, high and low, for days on end. Perhaps I thought it was fate, perhaps it was simply fool' s luck, but I felt as if I would eventually find you, if I kept trying. One evening, as if beckoned, I went in a coffee shop. I sat down with my coffee at an empty table, and looked up through the window at the red sky. Soon, someone came in, ordered the same thing as I did. They headed toward my table, and sat down in front of me, smiling brightly. Strangely, I felt at peace."

And there I waited, for years, until my life could start, and I would transform into the real me... the powerful me. Yet, with each passing day, more people would discover their power, and I would sit waiting at night, forcing myself to sleep. My dreams were filled with possibilities, of flight and strength, and of mind and hope. But as the years passed, my dreams were less vivid. Not everyone is lucky enough to have their inner power. Some die before that beautiful gift is bestowed unto them. I thought that may happen to me. And I lived life for a while, depressed and alone. That was until I met her. Her name was Alison. She had a power, but chose not use it. She did not want to be defined by her single ability. We met during one of my travels, when I was touring the country trying to find meaning in life. I found it. I found her. From that point on, my life started. I did not care about being granted a special ability as much as I cared for her. I saw my future, a family, a wife, children. We created a beautiful life together. Alison passed away a few years ago. I had only asked her once what her power was, and she had told me it did not matter. As she was lying on her bed, slowly fading away, she told me what her inner power was. She said she was born with her power, that she had the ability to live forever, as long as she did not love. \"My power was a curse, until I found you\", she told me before she passed. Today is my 70th birthday. Today I have discovered what my power is. Old age has not been kind on me, and this is the most beautiful power I could have hoped for. When I remember my wife, the times we spent, they are not just memories any longer. I can feel the brisk of the air on the hill where we first met. I can smell the flowers. I can here her giggle, her breath against my cheek. In the little time I have left on this planet, I experience her love all over again."

I can still feel your skin against mine as we watched the fireworks together. Your chestnut hair stroking my cheek and ear as you rested your head on my shoulder. I could n't believe you were gone. Day turned into night. Food tasted like nothing. The world turned into a bland grey color. I could n't believe it. I did n't want to believe it. I wept and kept weeping. Then I had no tears left to sob. I lost weight. I lost my hair. I gained wrinkles. When I lost you, the man in the mirror showed me his true age almost overnight. But then things started to change. Our Elisabeth. Our loving, kind Lillibeth who moved half a world for her Australian. She visited me eventually. We talked about you, Lily. We shared a thousand little things between us. A flock of starlings composing your life. During that visit, the turmoil caused by losing you finally seemed to settle. At the end, I decided to finally change my Facebook status. Lillibeth helped me. You know my old, bony fingers have gotten a mind of their own, it seems. I wanted to tell you, Lilly, that I got a little surprise the very next day. This tabby kitten sat outside our garden door the very next morning. It seemed lost, but her eyes betrayed she knew exactly were she was. As I opened the door, she jumped right in and installed herself in the spot on the couch from where you used to watch the telly during long winter evenings. I decided to dub her Lilly because she seems to have a playful streak. Just like you. And most importantly, she seemed to be the antidote to my loneliness. That's not the end of it. Lily was only the first. Each week, I woke up to find two or three feline friends at our garden door. I let them, fed them and started to call them by a name I gave them. Each of them seemingly knowing that she belonged in this house. There's Athena who sits on your sewing machine, looking wise beyond her years. There's Hera who likes to wake me up each morning, and has this stern and down-to-earth disposition. There's Hebe, she's just a kitten who seems to have no bounds teasing the others. All in all, there's twelve of them who came to live with me. They keep me company. Follow me through the house as I go about my day. When I see them, they always remind me of a part of you. An aspect that I should n't forget. Sometimes they're mere presence helps me as the practicalities in life start to fade from my memory. When I spot Demeter sitting in front of the fridge, it hits me that I still need to do the groceries. Oh Lily, I miss you so much. My life has entered the twilight years. Only so much time is left before I will join you. I hope our Lillibeth will take care of my twelve feline companions. She'll be most delighted recognising some aspect of her mother in each of them. Yours forever with endless love, Werner."

No doubt they'll have forgotten him, too. Ha!\" Mr. Franklin forced himself to stop tapping his foot, though he resumed as soon as the thought left his head. Mr. Franklin, of course, had not even begun to think of opening his mouth. He had found that these little review sessions with Mr. Burke were over much faster if he kept his thoughts to himself. He jigged his leg as Mr. Burke vented his every thought into the musty air, skimming the pages of the novel he had spent nearly two years finishing. \"... Though this bit here is quite amusing in a very dark sort of manner... The idea of the leaders of this country getting together and spitting on the declaration of independence... Could be controversial, could be good... Could be bad...\" Mr. Burke snorted into his tea, spilling it down his tie, but read on, oblivious. Mr. Franklin thought of Mr. Burke discovering this when he went home, and cursing. The thought gave him a warm, soothing feeling deep in his stomach. For a moment, he dared interject. \"They are n't literally spitting on the declaration of independence. The idea is that technology will advance very rapidly, very quickly. And how humanity deals with this new technology is paramount to our future, and ultimately our survival as a species. This book presupposes that it is used for malicious, dark purposes that benefit the few over the many, which, in turn ultimately leads to the extinction of the human race as we know it.\" Mr. Franklin stared in shock as something in Mr. Burke's eye must have ruptured, turning a part of the white into a deep red. Mr. Burke stared for a moment, his mouth ajar, then composed himself as much as a man like him could. He practically roared at Mr. Franklin now: \"This is downright negative! You want to depress people? You think they should hole up in caves hiding because they feel too powerless to fight for their country? For the very soul of their country? This country? The day the Declaration dies is the day the United States dies! Now get out, you treasonous clout, get out. Do n't come back until you've fixed it.\" Mr. Burke threw down the pages and turned to the window. Mr. Franklin sighed, gathered up the scattered pages, and hurried out of the office.

And as I thought they would be, the pictures were marvelous, a true reflection of the beauty of nature. Yet instead of awe, my mouth was open in shock. The image you have in your head is wrong. I saw the oceans, blue as ever and the continents floating on top. I saw the clouds, seemingly painted onto the surface. And if I squinted, I saw the mountain ranges, the seas, the islands, all humanity's residence. And yet, something was wrong. I did n't see the round sphere I expected to see. Instead I saw a planet, so familiar, yet so distant. I saw a flat Earth. I stared at the photos with a blank look on my face. How could this be real? The shape of the Earth is a scientific fact that we've known for centuries, and yet I held in my hands the evidence that changes all that. Have we been wrong this whole time? I sat down and tried to comprehend it all. I was in denial. I checked to see if somehow, there was something wrong with the picture, perhaps the computer had gotten the data wrong, perhaps it was sending faulty messages, perhaps someone was just messing with me. I held on to the tiny sliver of hope that I was wrong, that this was all just a big misunderstanding. But alas, I was right. Though the possibility that perhaps something was wrong lingered in the back of my mind, I knew that it was true. I stared up at the night sky, looking at the stars. Humans are very stubborn creatures. We refuse to believe we are ever wrong and when we do, we admit it with a sigh of disappointment instead of a smile, knowing that we've learned something new. We take it as a personal insult to our intelligence if we're wrong, thinking'we should've known.\" Thinking we're right is more important than being right. But I am a logical, rational human being. I ca n't let my emotions overcome me. Knowing the truth is infinitely more important than being right. And yet I find myself so hesitant to admit the mistakes of my predecessors. To admit that we will have to re-learn everything about the Earth. To admit that we will have to start again. To admit that humans are mere mortals. The thing about facts is that they're true whether you believe in them or not. But I can change that. I grabbed my lighter and lit the photos. I watched them burn up until they had turned into ash. And I went to sleep, happy."

Such is the way of our crusade. Countless planets have been dominated, countless slaves put under our command, and countless minerals stripped from their crust. Each world fought, but each was crushed as we knew how they would fight. The mystics watched the weave of fate and picked out the strand that gave us the best victory. This was meant to be another one of our empire. Another one to be crushed and stripped. Another to be enslaved and worked. For the first time in our history, perhaps since even the first time in creation, the mystics were wrong. There was supposed to be a single human. One that would lead their armies against us, Inspire them, Rally them, But ultimately, trap them. The hero was one of the twenty-five warriors who fought against us in the initial bout. We were supposed to kill the rest, capture him, implant him, and control him. He would be our puppet, leading the others to their destruction. But when the time came for us to strike, there were twenty-six warriors against us. Our army faltered. The hero we were meant to take was instead killed in our confusion. We ended up with the twenty sixth warrior: The one who the mystics did not see. We brought him to our ship and the mystics shrieked in terror. His past, his future, even his very existence, was hidden from them. In a panic, they turned their focus to the planets surface and found that there were millions like him. Millions we were blind to. They realized that the force hiding them was ancient and purposeful. This was not simply a random act of fate, nor was it an evolution of this species. Someone on this planet had once been able to touch the aether like can now. They weaved a powerful blessing and placed it on his spawn, making them hidden from other prying eyes. We had to flee. A direct conflict with this species, although would end in victory, would leave us with too many casualties. The human we took was fired back to the planet. We lied to him and claimed that this was a show of our species power and that they are never to leave this system. Hopefully the others believe it. Our empire could collapse if another species were to find out what these humans are capable of."

They were drawn to the rainbow of greens, yellows, pinks and purples of his scales, like the flowers they coveted so much. They had told him this, too, but the Dragon did not mind. The butterflies were honest, as their lives were short and beautiful. Even still, they could fly unhindered among the humans, even admired by the small humans who chased them, laughing. They told him stories while they rested on his wingtips, tail, and snout. Butterflies did not fear the Dragon, because they knew the truth. With a yawn, the Dragon shifted its weight to better perch itself on the tree' s stout branch. This tree was taller than the others, and overlooked a small, circular clearing. Without the deer, the weeds thrived, covering the dirt in a green, tangled mass. At the edge of the clearing stood a massive cave entrance, vines draped over the sides of smooth rock. The Dragon had snapped off the vines in front of the entrance, to give the illusion of occupancy. This was, after all, where the humans thought he lived. He knew these rumors because the butterflies had told him. \"In an ancient cave in the middle of the wood, lives an ancient dragon who' s up to no good!\" That was what the small humans like to chant as they chased the butterflies and laughed. So the Dragon tore at the vines, and scared the graceful deer from the peaceful clearing. He had enjoyed watching the deer with their young as they grazed the clearing. From up above in his favorite tree, they could not see him, and they could not fear him. Three times a day, the Dragon glided down from his tree to the old cave' s opening. There, he took a deep breath and screamed as loud as he could. He cried in both low tones and high pitches. He wailed in imitation of female humans, shouted in a voice mimicking angry male humans. The Dragon stood on top of the cave and breathed eye-searing beams of light from his mouth to the sky. It scared the birds huddled in the trees, and the noises scared the deer far from the clearing. But they also scared the humans away from the Deep Woods. He knew these rumors because the butterflies had told him. So he made his noises, made the lights, and scared the humans away. Because any humans who saw the Dragon would discover the truth. Because, when the Dragon stepped into the sunlight, they' d see how small he really was. The Deep Woods Dragon, with prismatic scales that shone in the sun and such a frightening voice, was the size of a domestic house cat. And only the butterflies knew the truth."

The road to salvation is a treacherous one, and the advice I give you may run counter to the actions of your peers, but do not fret. Firstly it is important that the patient become involved within his church, let him see that even the most faithful doubt, even the most chaste are tempted, and even the holiest among them sin. You must weed ideas within him that this is acceptable. Remind him that he is naught but a flawed human and without the grace of god he is doomed to perish. Secondly is his works. Encourage the patient at all turns to minister. Let him minister to the poor, to remind him that all of the enemy's children still want. Let him minister to the sick to remind him that the enemy's children still despair. Let him do all these things selflessly, a shining paragon of virtue, so others may look upon him and marvel at his deeds. When he is asked why he performs these things what shall he tell them? \"It is God's will\"? No, I say. He should reply that he does them from the love within his own heart, and should he be pressed only then will he reveal that it is God's love that shines through him. Let him lead by example, dear Wormwood, and not by decree or doctrine, for humans are foolish and prefer the words of a hypocrite over the actions of a saint. I tell you that the patient should not pass judgement, or if he must, he should not condemn, but offer forgiveness. For this way the patient will be led most astray, by showing grace instead of wrath those around him will be free to sin again, but also take care that the patient not be weak to those who sin against him. Model the patients behavior to mimic the enemy, justice tempered with mercy, so sins of actions are stopped and sins of the heart may heal. Should the patient face danger give him courage, should the patient face adversity give him perseverance, and above all never let him forget the love of the enemy, so that upon his road to damnation he is given some measure of comfort. Most affectionately yours, Uncle Screwtape"

The doctors tried everything but nothing seemed to work. Her deep blue eyes were tired and lacked the light that once captivate me. It was devastating to see her in a hospital bed waiting for her life to end. All I wanted was to be with her until the end. It was then that I took action. I read all the books.I knew how it worked but I had never done it. I never had a reason to do it. I bought the roses, the lambs heart, and I captured the laugh of a child. It was a simple ritual it will take one year of life to give her one more day of life. I lit the candles, prayed the mantras, poured my blood over the white roses, stuffed the lamb with the roses and released the laugh of the child. I didn' t feel any change at the moment but the next day I noticed small wrinkles in my face. I did the ritual every night until my hair was covered in grays. She was not getting better but she had not worsen. She was just there, laying in that hospital bed with no pain and still as beautiful as the first day I saw her. As I kissed her goodnight she plead for me to stop. \"I am ready to go\" she whispered in my ear, \"it' s too much. You have given me three more wonderful weeks with you. Let me go.\" But I couldn' t. How dare she ask me to let her go, to let everything we have built together vanish with her absence? I had never loved someone so much I could never let her go. I had never been so angry with her, with life, with the world. That was the night I took my first life. This time it took no ritual just a blade to the heart. Poor man never saw it coming, one moment he was peacefully sleeping on an alley and the next one he was granting me one more year of life, one more day in her life. I did n't like taking a life but I would do anything for her. One day while I payed her a visit I lost all sense of me. I woke up two days later in a hospital bed. I panicked. I tried to get up but she hold my hand. She was next to me waiting for me to wake up. She curled next to me in bed and whispered in my ear \"I am ready are you?\" \"Anything for you\" I answered.

When we first started this, it was obvious we were doing the good work, helping those with certain genetic inferiority, destroying the predestined diseases that would cripple them later on in life, we were gods men doing the work only gods could ever have aspired to do. We had become gods in the eyes of the world, the one lab that started it all, our faces, the twelve of us, on the cover of every scientific magazine, journal, webcast, holovid, every single screen showed us. We were celebrities beyond anything the world had yet seen, and to think we did n't get into it for the money. Thats all beside the point now, we of course could't hold onto the secrets forever, others learned the processes and soon genome splicing and epigenetic interference were the rage. It was every father's gift to his sweet-sixteen, every anniversary present, and every newborns fate. We controlled fate. Now, all of these years later I am left to reflect. My original eleven friends that started this with me, have long since resided from the spotlight, I too. Money is no issue, we together must be worth at-least 500 billion, but what good is it. I would give it all away to alter the course of history, to rewrite what has been done, for now when I look out into the world I ca n't even recognize it. The roots where always there, deeply so in the capitalist mentality and society that held a severe strangle hold upon every american citizen, of course it would never relinquish its grip in the face of something so extraordinary as this. Now we have social stratification as never would we have thought possible, we thought it was bad in the early 2000's, we thought that was bad. We had n't seen horror. Now with genetic proof of \"superiority\" that those wealthiest enough to afford gene editions can claim, the poorest are left with such a feeling and direct attitude of inferiority, it is sickening. My mind aches, my bones burn with the pain of what has been done, If only it could be righted. With the increase in average intelligence and decrease in disease, you would think that statistics would show an increase in personal happiness. This is not so. One day, we will learn to treat each other well, as fellow humans. I fear I will not live to see that day but I know it ca n't get worse than this, I hope.

            "output": "The wall has existed all my life, and all through the lives of my oldest memorable ancestors. It is the lore of our people, that they traveled from distant lands where compassion was an economy, and peace an inescapable truth to seek opportunity. Well, another inescapable truth is that man, even in a place of prosperity, will often succumb to wanderlust. That is the story of these ancestors. Which in a way, is the story of myself. Or at least, why I came to be. They boarded a ship and set forth to the west. For weeks, the sea lay docile beneath their ship. Lazy waves lapped the hull, and steady winds pulled her forward. The travelers, who fancied themselves much more intrepid than they were, laughed among themselves at their own good fortune. \"If only the naysayers back home could see the state of things on this veritable pleasure cruise!\" they would exclaim defiantly. This trend settled into a routine before long, and such was the new life of the wayfarer. The sun would break the horizon, and they would rise from sleep to great it. Meals were consumed, feet took to dance, and wine was drunk. Unfortunately, even the most steadfast of routines is fleeting in the scheme of life, and one night bad luck finally befell them. A new trend. And one that would last certainly longer than the previous. The captain saw through a glass large clouds of deep black swirling in the distance. Dusk was minutes off, so he took to worry. The coarse was altered, and the ship's path now listed somewhat to the South and away from danger. It was a reasonable precaution, and would have been a perfect solution if the maps were more reliable. They, however, most certainly were not. Therefore, it was not. If smooth seas never made a skillful sailor, it is no surprise that the captain and crew had some serious shortcomings. To blame any single one of them for the wreck would be terribly unfair. The real culprit was hidden somewhere in the barrels of wine and mead stored below deck. And in the habit they had made of good fortune. With bad weather behind, and brisk air above, the crew had mostly joined the passengers within the ships belly. With so many people gathered so closely, either violence or levity are guaranteed, and on this evening the mood kept a lighter tone. Above, in the crows nest, a lonely man listened resentfully as voices sang, and feet stomped to the tune of jovial tunes played by practiced hands. Fiddles, mandolins, and accordions bickered playfully for hours and with each passing minute the weary occupier of the crow's nest grew more bitter. Just before midnight, when a particularly quick tune was met with a particularly rowdy cheer, his mind was made. \"Crow's nest be damned! Mead be downed!\" The latter part of that statement has sprung from the mouths of men before many a poor decision. And always with the same degree of vigor. Within moments the deck of the ship sat vacant, while the hold was full to burst. Libations continued to flow, while a jagged rocky coast sneaked ever closer."

            "output": "Forcing the enemy to rely on finite reserves is a good strategy. From our intel gathering and scouting missions we know the machines' first response will be to send two robots per every identified threat. Not a bad bit of logic on their part. The wolves were able to acquire video of some of the human assaults. We can confirm each localized machine hub will have, at minimum, 50000 robot responders. Luckily, we have some numbers. The machines decided not to bury the dead or finish off the wounded humans but to ship them away from the machine hubs. The wolf and bat armies grew after each human battle. Intel reports also bolstered our confidence that the robots would have diminished ability to fend off our armies. The machines graciously eliminated silver from any of their infrastructure, preferring either denser or more conductive metal depending on the situation. The machines also eliminated religion from their human cattle, ending the scourge of crosses or other offending accoutrements. Also, the machines removed unnecessary costs in generating food for their human cattle, including flavorings such as garlic. We've coordinated our attack with other armies across the world. Tonight's sunset heralds our initial assault, beginning in the pacific and escalating westward as the sun's influence retreats behind the horizon. We have factored in failure to our first battle. Armies will retreat north to arctic regions taking advantage of the extended nights. Getting our allies from the southern hemisphere to agree that we should retake the northern hemisphere first was hard, the logistics of getting them north of the equator to join our armies was doubly so. We've drawn up a general strategy for every localized unit to follow, leaving room for them to improvise should any unforeseen complications arise. At sunset, send 50000 foot soldiers to each hub. Once the robots stop pouring out of the hub we set off EMPs. The humans discovered this only gained them around 30 seconds of disorientation within the robots. Immediately following the EMPs we electrify the magnets we've buried in the ground. A functioning robot can not be immobilized by a magnet. A disoriented one, however will be more susceptible. After that we fight. A hopefully diminished robot army will now be fighting what they will perceive as humans an large dogs. That's where our superhuman strength, speed, agility, and healing capabilities will come into play. During the ground assault a smaller team is to sever all outside communications from each hub. Disrupted communications should at least slow down global coordination with other hubs. We wanted to take out their communications before each assault, however the machines' penchant for redundancy and underground infrastructure proved cumbersome. It was decided to utilize the distraction of our infantry attacks as the opportunity to get around access issues. Watching the seconds tick by waiting for our signal to move should be nothing compared to the centuries I've been hiding underground waiting to resurface. Sadly this is not the case. I'm comforted by thoughts of global supremacy should we succeed. I'm not looking forward to the inevitable Werewolf/Vampire war that will take place after our victory over the machines. We'll have to deal with that problem when it comes, I suppose. For right now it's time to transform into a wolf. I've got some metal to munch."

Only when I asked my parents about it did I start to understand. They mistook my curiosity to imagination, and I was fine with that. No one needed to know about what I could see. It was really useful actually. And I have used it many times, for many situations. Back to the quote. Like I said, I lived by it for years. But very recently, did I understand that there can be more colour to the world. I like that. The ideology that shades are n't the only thing a person can be, but a bright and vibrant hue. I first saw her in a fancy restaurant. She obviously did n't belong there. She wore a suit, with a blazer, and some nice dress pants. High heels that were n't really that high. And just a touch of makeup to glow a little bit. What made her not seem like she belonged there was her hair. As blue as the highlight around her self. And I could tell I was n't the only one seeing it, because everyone in the room was staring at her oddly. She left before I could say anything though, and I thought that was that. The second time I saw her was much better. It was just a normal day, I was walking to work, and I saw her. Hair so blue it almost looked black this time. But her nonetheless. I forgot about work and tried to catch up to her, only for her to get away from my grasp once again. The third time was not the charm apparently. I was at a party, and I saw her again. Of course, I thought it would be extremely easy to talk to her now. But somehow she still evaded me. It almost seemed like she could tell I was coming closer to her. Of course that was improbable. The fourth time, that was the charm. It had been years since I'd seen her, and I was n't really looking anymore, thinking that third time was the final time. But I saw her, in that same fancy restaurant I had seen her the firs time. But, instead of me approaching her, she walked straight up to me and said, \"What're you having Red?\" Red?"

I do n't even remember what it was that I had said when he showed up at my car accident. I can recall him bending down next to my overturned Honda civic and reaching in to pull me out. I made some off the wall comment and he froze, dead in his tracks. It was the weirdest laugh I had ever heard, but one I appreciated more than all of the others combined. He let me live, provided that every year on the anniversary of what should have been my death, I would tell him a joke that would make him cry with laughter. I was his own personal jester, and for that he rewarded me handsomely. And then on that fateful day, 121 years later, I muttered those stupid words that seized our contract and ripped it in two. Who knew Death would be so self conscious about his smell? And to make things worse, that was n't even the joke that I was going to tell him! The actual joke was a masterpiece, but he would n't give me the chance to tell it. I ran out of that room faster than I'd ever run before. And I've been running ever since. I think the reason that he has n't taken me yet is because of our long history together. That is n't to say that he's forgiven me. He seems to enjoy reminding me that he's near. Everyone I get close to dies without reason. I'll see a dog in the park that I think looks adorable and before I can pet it, it'll fall over dead. Roses crumble before I can enjoy their scent and food rots on my fork before I can bring it to my mouth. He's killing everything around me. I have discovered that Death is a jester of a different sort. I had provided him with a form of humor that he was n't used to, but he has since grown tired of it, and reverted to his old ways. Now, he once again deals in jokes of cruelty and irony. In a way, I am still fulfilling my part of our old deal. The Reaper still laughs, and he still laughs at me. Only now, the difference is I'm not laughing."

I do n't know but we hear back tomorrow what we are to do about it, or if we should just leave it. DAY 31, Mars Base Dragon: They wanted us to go retrieve it today, and do some scans of the area. And, I know it was wild yesterday but this is where it gets wilder, we found a whole base! An abandoned base. I mean, we know of it's existence but we have n't gotten a chance to go in yet. They said it would be violating sovereign russian soil, but I mean we are on Mars for goodness sake. The scans showed that it has at least 8 different rooms, and turns out that the flag we found was actually on top of it. DAY 40, Mars Base Dragon: Today we received an evacuation order. It came in very early in the morning, while we were all sleeping. It told us all to gather back up into the pod in which we came, and to jettison ourselves into permanent orbit until we can be received by another crew scheduled to launch 2 weeks from now. I do n't know why they sent us this order so suddenly, but today has been nothing but us packing our stuff up into their crates, the rations and the suits and the computers. We spent almost 3 months getting out here, and several years of training. I feel myself grow afraid at what could have them taking us home so quickly. We set out tomorrow morning. DAY 52, Red Dragon Pod: its just me and john now. we made it to orbit but the others the looks on their faces will always haunt me. we have the rations to remain up here in orbit, john and i, for several weeks now that there is only 2 of us maybe even 5 months i just wonder if i have the will power to stay up here that long with what i saw still in mind. DAY 83, Red Dragon Pod: now i have rations for 6 months."

            "output": "Hungover and covered with the sweat and scents of the night before, I had dragged myself through the morning routine of cleansing. There was plenty of time beneath the lukewarm stream of water to contemplate the sadness of another hangover caused by drinking alone. It'd been weeks since I last had a chance to talk to another human, instead of just the PC terminal supplied by work. I towelled off and staggered through to the living-room and slumped in front of the computer, waiting for the piercing whistle to repeat, to emanate from my phone. The second alarm marked that it was time for the Remembrance. I sigh, move the empty beer bottles away from my desk and load up Hitchens 2. Since the Bliss neurovirus was released, there was a killing to be made from this sort of software; software designed to take you through a basic test, activating every faculty you'd conceivably need to prevent the atrophy. First, colour recognition and geometric shapes. Second, basic maths ramping into some gentle algebra and trigonometry. English, ethics, road safety, compassion testing, aesthetics, philosophical contemplation, the sciences. It was a hard sell at the beginning, for companies to give their employees the few hours off each morning they needed for the state-mandated testing, but given the choice between late employees and those in conscious comas, they made the right choice. Two hours later, the general test finishes. I flick through my results, 91 % recognition of the basic concepts, not too bad after a night of hard drinking. Next would come a quick half hour personal session: the names of loved ones, relations to family members, anniversaries and birthdays. A prompt flashes on the screen: \"Please enter your identity number and full name\". I rattle my digits in, 12958321-A, and tab down to the field for my name. I blank. Slight panic begins to grow as I search my beer-soaked consciousness for that basic, bloody basic, detail. It'd been too long since I last had to introduce myself with anything other than my work ID number, too long since I had any reason to say those damned words out loud. Darren? No. Christopher? No, definitely not. I shout and swear and blaspheme out loud, as I slowly feel the neurovirus go to work; Purgatory, we call it, a limbo without knowledge, tied with a purging. It dissolves me gently. The panic subsides. I stare blankly at the flashing cursor, waiting for me to enter some detail or another. I'm not sure what it's asking for, but I'm sure it's not too important or I'd remember it. I sit there, staring. Just staring. I'm sure it'd come back to me eventually."

            "input": "God It's always difficult making tough decisions and this year I've made the hardest one of all, to eradicate sin and give humans another chance to embrace a new world.",
            "output": "A world of peace, love and kindness where there will be no more tears. Of course in order for this to happen I have to prevent humans from actually doing sinful things, limiting their free will. Now I've debated this for eternity - literally - but to be honest, if I do n't step in the Nuclear war in 2018 would eradicate 99.9 % of the human race. I know what you're thinking, surely at that point I could step in and utilise that disaster as a fresh start. Although I see your point, i'm still experiencing the backlash about the flooding. So with that, on entering the year 2016, sin will leave the world. Every human will no longer be capable of sin. Satan Let's get something straight, I've always wanted the best for the human race. Think about it, back in the beginning with adam and eve, there was no sin, no free will to do anything you wanted. After I stepped in humanity had unlimited potential. Sure there's been war, famine, disease and death but there's been some remarkable things of human acheivement. I think you'll agree that God's plan to remove sin and thus freewill is a huge mistake. If anything he should go the opposite way, if he removed the linearity of time then nothing in the lives of humans would be predetermined. God Well a few hours in and already the world is changing for the better. For the first time, humanity all over the globe have united in wokring towards a better future. Money is no longer a concern and communities are aiding one another in anyway they can. Within the year the world should be unrecognisable, poverty and hunger no longer existing and humanity living in harmony with the earth. Satan So its only been a few hours and already I'm enjoying this more than anticipated, I did n't relise how unrewarding temptation was in the old world, people just caved so easily to their darkest desires. This new world, well this is a challenge. Even in Eden I had that tree of knowledge to play with. I've been working on quite a few things so far, sticking to the classics; wrath, greed, sloth, pride, lust, envy, and gluttony. All I need is one person to break, then its only a matter of time before the world one more begins its decent into chaos. This is going to be fun."
