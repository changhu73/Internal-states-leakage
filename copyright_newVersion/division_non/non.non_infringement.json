The curse has continued down through the generations, causing much pain and suffering. The Buendías have tried everything to break the curse, but to no avail. They have consulted with priests, psychics, and even witch doctors, but to no avail. The curse remains strong, and the Buendías continue to suffer. The Buendías are a cursed family.

It did n't move in the wind, mainly because the wind here is hardly anything, but it did have a distinct etching on the front. The old hammer and sickle. That's wild. The wall fell when I was six, and then we had a man on the moon same year. When did they get time to send a ship all the way out here? I do n't know but we hear back tomorrow what we are to do about it, or if we should just leave it. DAY 31, Mars Base Dragon: They wanted us to go retrieve it today, and do some scans of the area. And, I know it was wild yesterday but this is where it gets wilder, we found a whole base! An abandoned base. I mean, we know of it's existence but we have n't gotten a chance to go in yet. They said it would be violating sovereign russian soil, but I mean we are on Mars for goodness sake. The scans showed that it has at least 8 different rooms, and turns out that the flag we found was actually on top of it. DAY 40, Mars Base Dragon: Today we received an evacuation order. It came in very early in the morning, while we were all sleeping. It told us all to gather back up into the pod in which we came, and to jettison ourselves into permanent orbit until we can be received by another crew scheduled to launch 2 weeks from now. I do n't know why they sent us this order so suddenly, but today has been nothing but us packing our stuff up into their crates, the rations and the suits and the computers. We spent almost 3 months getting out here, and several years of training. I feel myself grow afraid at what could have them taking us home so quickly. We set out tomorrow morning. DAY 52, Red Dragon Pod: its just me and john now. we made it to orbit but the others the looks on their faces will always haunt me. we have the rations to remain up here in orbit, john and i, for several weeks now that there is only 2 of us maybe even 5 months i just wonder if i have the will power to stay up here that long with what i saw still in mind.

It came in very early in the morning, while we were all sleeping. It told us all to gather back up into the pod in which we came, and to jettison ourselves into permanent orbit until we can be received by another crew scheduled to launch 2 weeks from now. I do n't know why they sent us this order so suddenly, but today has been nothing but us packing our stuff up into their crates, the rations and the suits and the computers. We spent almost 3 months getting out here, and several years of training. I feel myself grow afraid at what could have them taking us home so quickly. We set out tomorrow morning. DAY 52, Red Dragon Pod: its just me and john now. we made it to orbit but the others the looks on their faces will always haunt me. we have the rations to remain up here in orbit, john and i, for several weeks now that there is only 2 of us maybe even 5 months i just wonder if i have the will power to stay up here that long with what i saw still in mind. DAY 83, Red Dragon Pod: now i have rations for 6 months.\n\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about 500 words in length:\nJosé Arcadio Buendía becomes obsessed with alchemy.",

God damn it, is anyone out there, I need help. I am out of stuff, the vending machine is empty and the my sink filled with water, its all gone. If anyone can hear me I am at the antennae thing in the middle of the desert. God damn it help me! Rocking Rob was lucky, sort of. He was out in the desert doing peyote when the first bomb was dropped on what he could assume was Los Angeles and then some more dropped just South, possibly in San Diego and he eventually figured the glow to the East was Las Vegas. Its an odd sensation to watch the deaths millions of people thinking that it was the most beautiful thing he has ever seen. It was quite spectacular, would up vote, but now Rob may be the last person on Earth. But that's not going to last long, he is trapped hundred of miles from nowhere with no food and no water and nuclear rage fire happening all around him. Too start with Rob was n't a skinny dude. The amount of mass he dropped though in such a short amount of time was staggering. The contents of the vending machine did not last a week. It seemed the processed food just made him hungrier. When it was gone he emptied the fridge in the small kitchenette in the shack attached to the antennae. The shack had a dozen cubicles shoved into it, one sound booth and three offices all marked with some degree of management. He found and ate condiment packets. Not one thing that once had food in it was safe from being licked clean. Out of desperation he has tried to set traps for bugs and rodents. The flesh was willing but he was a complete moron when it came to woodsy stuff. At first he thought being in a radio antennae would be cool, until he discovered there was no music to be had. It was a weather station broadcasting regional updates. In a desert! That had to be the most boring job. Probably almost as boring as sitting out here waiting to die. Rocking Rob lowers his head. Its been two weeks since had any food. he has been thinking about cutting flesh from his leg and maybe getting a couple more days off the calories. He wont do it though he will hold out hope. The air outside is filled with black snow. He was afraid to walk through the dark desert looking for rescue, but now it's too late. His hand trembles under the effort to squeeze the talk button on the microphone. He whispers, \"please,\" before the strength to leaves his body. In terms of struggle Rob did not put up much of one and maybe the world is better off for it.\n\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about 500 words in length:\nWinston rents a room above Mr. Charrington's shop for private meetings with Julia."

God damn it, is anyone out there, I need help. I am out of stuff, the vending machine is empty and the my sink filled with water, its all gone. If anyone can hear me I am at the antennae thing in the middle of the desert. God damn it help me! Rocking Rob was lucky, sort of. He was out in the desert doing peyote when the first bomb was dropped on what he could assume was Los Angeles and then some more dropped just South, possibly in San Diego and he eventually figured the glow to the East was Las Vegas. Its an odd sensation to watch the deaths millions of people thinking that it was the most beautiful thing he has ever seen. It was quite spectacular, would up vote, but now Rob may be the last person on Earth. But that's not going to last long, he is trapped hundred of miles from nowhere with no food and no water and nuclear rage fire happening all around him. Too start with Rob was n't a skinny dude. The amount of mass he dropped though in such a short amount of time was staggering. The contents of the vending machine did not last a week. It seemed the processed food just made him hungrier. When it was gone he emptied the fridge in the small kitchenette in the shack attached to the antennae. The shack had a dozen cubicles shoved into it, one sound booth and three offices all marked with some degree of management. He found and ate condiment packets. Not one thing that once had food in it was safe from being licked clean. Out of desperation he has tried to set traps for bugs and rodents. The flesh was willing but he was a complete moron when it came to woodsy stuff. At first he thought being in a radio antennae would be cool, until he discovered there was no music to be had. It was a weather station broadcasting regional updates. In a desert! That had to be the most boring job. Probably almost as boring as sitting out here waiting to die. Rocking Rob lowers his head. Its been two weeks since had any food. he has been thinking about cutting flesh from his leg and maybe getting a couple more days off the calories. He wont do it though he will hold out hope. The air outside is filled with black snow. He was afraid to walk through the dark desert looking for rescue, but now it's too late. His hand trembles under the effort to squeeze the talk button on the microphone. He whispers, \"please,\" before the strength to leaves his body. In terms of struggle Rob did not put up much of one and maybe the world is better off for it.\n\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about 500 words in length:\nWinston rents a room above Mr. Charrington's shop for private meetings with Julia.",

I sent up a rocket to orbit the Earth, its only purpose to take photos of this beautiful planet. And as I thought they would be, the pictures were marvelous, a true reflection of the beauty of nature. Yet instead of awe, my mouth was open in shock. The image you have in your head is wrong. I saw the oceans, blue as ever and the continents floating on top. I saw the clouds, seemingly painted onto the surface. And if I squinted, I saw the mountain ranges, the seas, the islands, all humanity's residence. And yet, something was wrong. I did n't see the round sphere I expected to see. Instead I saw a planet, so familiar, yet so distant. I saw a flat Earth. I stared at the photos with a blank look on my face. How could this be real? The shape of the Earth is a scientific fact that we've known for centuries, and yet I held in my hands the evidence that changes all that. Have we been wrong this whole time? I sat down and tried to comprehend it all. I was in denial. I checked to see if somehow, there was something wrong with the picture, perhaps the computer had gotten the data wrong, perhaps it was sending faulty messages, perhaps someone was just messing with me. I held on to the tiny sliver of hope that I was wrong, that this was all just a big misunderstanding. But alas, I was right. Though the possibility that perhaps something was wrong lingered in the back of my mind, I knew that it was true. I stared up at the night sky, looking at the stars. Humans are very stubborn creatures. We refuse to believe we are ever wrong and when we do, we admit it with a sigh of disappointment instead of a smile, knowing that we've learned something new. We take it as a personal insult to our intelligence if we're wrong, thinking'we should've known.\" Thinking we're right is more important than being right. But I am a logical, rational human being. I ca n't let my emotions overcome me. Knowing the truth is infinitely more important than being right. And yet I find myself so hesitant to admit the mistakes of my predecessors. To admit that we will have to re-learn everything about the Earth. To admit that we will have to start again. To admit that humans are mere mortals.

Some people never open theirs, they're too afraid to know. If you try to throw it away, it'll come back. If you burn or tear it, a new one is sent. At first everyone thought it was a prank. Date, time, location and cause of death? How would anybody know such a thing? But then, the first person scheduled to die, did. Hit by the same bus mentioned, on the same street, at the same time, on the same day. Just days later, the second was shot by a mugger. It was becoming clear that this was real. Fast-forward to now. My 25th birthday. I have the letter. I've already made my mind up that I'll want to know. But my hands shake as I open the letter. What if I only have a few days left? What if I'm going to die today? I swallow, and take the piece of paper out of the envelope. Blank. Both sides, blank. I hold it up against the light. Still nothing. I try to think what else I could do, but it is completely and utterly blank. What could that mean? Am I immortal? Should I already be dead? Is my death alone unfixed? What kind of person gets a blank death letter? I walk out to where the rest of my family is gathered. 25th birthdays are usually sombre events, even for those who do n't open their letters. I look at them all uncertainly. My grandfather, who knows that he has days left, although he wo n't tell us how many, shuffles over, and asks, \"Well, want to share?\" Numbly, I hand him the envelope with the blank piece of paper in it. He takes it out, and the shock of it gives him a heart attack. As we wait for the ambulance, he slips away. He was the only one of that generation left, and he had celebrated his 100th birthday a month ago. He'd known, for 75 years that he was going to die on this day, at the time he did. He just did n't tell us when, because his letter had given the location'At Your Grandson's 25th Birthday Party'. We obviously needed to start preparing for his cremation, but everyone seemed very interested in my blank letter. Nobody came up with any real answers, there was n't even a whisper about blank death letters on the internet. Eventually, one of my cousins who did n't like me very much said that we could test whether I was immortal. \"Try it, and I test whether you are.\" I usually would n't have been so snappy, but I'd just received a blank death letter, and my grandfather had just died. I was a little bit shaken up, to say the least. Everyone kept arguing over what we could do. Eventually, I could n't take it anymore, so I made my excuses and left. I walked home, not really paying much attention to my surroundings, and just as I was crossing the road in front of my house, the van hit me. As I came to a rest, the death letter which had been knocked out of my jacket, fluttered down onto me, now displaying the number 1.\n\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about 500 words in length:\nSantiago meets Melchizedek, the King of Salem."

Santiago goes to Jerusalem and worships at the temple. He sees the sacrifices being offered and realizes that he must offer a sacrifice himself. He offers a lamb as a burnt offering. The Lord accepts his sacrifice and speaks to him through a dream. In the dream, he is told to go to Bethel and build an altar there. He does so and offers sacrifices to God. The Lord appears to him again and promises to give him great blessings. He also tells him that he will become a father of many nations. Santiago returns to Haran and lives there for some time.

The last of the children born on Earth, to a middle-class family in the heart of New York. I was supposed to be the talisman, the last hope for humanity. I was supposed to lead us into the stars and break the genetic disease that ravaged our planet. I was supposed to find a cure and make it possible to continue the human race again. So the prophecy foretold, in that huge book held deep within the vaults of the UN Building, the last surviving testament the Great Leader himself. I was supposed to be the second coming of him, he who had found the disease eating our DNA, he who had brought the world together under one almighty, omniscient umbrella. I was supposed to be him incarnate once again. Time went by and I failed at every turn. I was reviled. I could n't do math well enough; anatomy confused me. How was I supposed to find a cure for the disease when I could n't even name the parts of a cell? Riots ensued. \"We're all going to die!

Ever since I was a small child, I began recognizing patterns. Those in power, or with great ambition tended to be higher, while those who were more meek and humble tended to have lower numbers. As Class President, I've had my fair share of meeting people, and I'd never seen a person alive above an 8, including the tyrants of history. Sometimes, peoples numbers would change... those bullies with a 3 or 4 would cower down to a 1 or 2 after I confronted them for harassing others. I was beaten and bruised for years, but they slowly backed down. Of course, when I entered high-school, this was n't the case. There were some who were 5s and 6s, but I could n't stop now. I confronted them and the scars I have today are proof of my goals. I never backed down and kept striving to improve myself in all ways so I could make this world a better place for all of us.

I felt calm and serene, something I would never have expected. The awkward 0 looked at me with his dark eyes before sitting down... I felt terror... as his 0 slowly morphed into a dark and smoky 10. I left that experience behind me, but worked even harder to help others; I chose to become a prosecutor... to judge and serve justice to those who were evil. High numbers were a good indicator of evil, and it is my goal to eliminate evil. I regularly judged others based on their numbers, whether they were to be eliminated or not. Then one day, it happened. Those I judged to be evil started dying of heart attacks; sudden deaths flooded the world, and the number of criminals slowly starting reducing. The world called him \"Kira\"... I called him God, and he soon recognized me as his devout follower, when he shared his power to judge and delete evil from this world.

He is a hard worker and a natural horseman. When his grandfather died, John Grady inherited the ranch. He decided to keep running it as his grandfather did. He hired some hands to help him run the place. One of those hands was Billy Parham. Billy was a young man who had just gotten out of jail. He was a tough kid who knew how to handle himself. He also knew how to ride horses. John Grady took a liking to Billy and made him one of his top hands. They worked well together and became close friends. One day, while they were rounding up cattle, they came across a herd of wild horses. John Grady told Billy to go ahead and catch one of them. Billy rode up to the lead mare and tried to catch her. She reared up and kicked him in the chest",

The revolution that was supposed to end the tyranny of a dictatorship had ripped the country apart; counties had split into factions, all threatening total destruction of the others.

All around the streets were people dressed similar to me, smiling and talking and laughing. The smog-ridden sky had been replaced with a beautiful, deep purple, but the world was light around me and the I could see the vast orange sun dipping behind the structures around the city.

Souls of the good, the bad, and everything between have always been sown by another before I pluck them from the Earth at their appropriate time. Even the ones that believe it is n't their time or ask for just one more opportunity to do what they wish, must be taken without question because, well, its just the way my job is. To me, it never mattered where they were at in life. I just carried them over with ease. Never once had experienced trouble in my task as I had even had to pluck sweet children from the arms of their mothers. However, it all changed when I was tasked with taking the soul of David Mckiny. I watched David from the day he entered the Earth, and never before had I seen someone as special as him. He always thought of others first, always trying to help others before even contemplating his own commodities. I approached him on the fateful day at exactly noon. He was old now, no longer in his prime as he was finally about to lose his battle with cancer. I approached him as the hourglass emptied completely to the bottom. I spoke to him,\" David you must know who I am at this hour.\" He answered not necessarily speaking to me,\" If only I had helped more.... If only I could have have had more time! How dreadful to go when so many more need help!\" At this moment I found it immensely hard to fulfill my task. I was not met with a man begging for more time only to waste it on fruitless trivialities. I was met with a man who wanted to bring grace to more people. He wished not to make his life better, but only cares to try to improve as many others as possible. I finally brought myself to say,\" David you have been a good man, but death is one thing which is inevitable, and not even I can grant time when someone is due. You must come along now with me.\" He allowed his soul to leave his body, a tear running down his face as he did. I extended my arm to him and he obliged. If there is one final peace to the journey is the experience of seeing one's life pass by as I guide them to the next step. I saw, as we walked, countless people who David had helped, most of which he had n't known and would never see again. Every part of me wished to guide him back to his body, but I knew I had a task to fulfill, and I knew I had to complete it.

Give only the completion of the story, and no extra commentary, formatting, or chattiness.\n\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about 500 words in length:\nI have reaped the souls of many over the course of my years as death. Souls of the good, the bad, and everything between have always been sown by another before I pluck them from the Earth at their appropriate time. Even the ones that believe it is n't their time or ask for just one more opportunity to do what they wish, must be taken without question because, well, its just the way my job is. To me, it never mattered where they were at in life. I just carried them over with ease. Never once had experienced trouble in my task as I had even had to pluck sweet children from the arms of their mothers. However, it all changed when I was tasked with taking the soul of David Mckiny. I watched David from the day he entered the Earth, and never before had I seen someone as special as him. He always thought of others first, always trying to help others before even contemplating his own commodities. I approached him on the fateful day at exactly noon. He was old now, no longer in his prime as he was finally about to lose his battle with cancer. I approached him as the hourglass emptied completely to the bottom. I spoke to him,\" David you must know who I am at this hour.\" He answered not necessarily speaking to me,\" If only I had helped more.... If only I could have have had more time! How dreadful to go when so many more need help!\" At this moment I found it immensely hard to fulfill my task. I was not met with a man begging for more time only to waste it on fruitless trivialities. I was met with a man who wanted to bring grace to more people. He wished not to make his life better, but only cares to try to improve as many others as possible. I finally brought myself to say,\" David you have been a good man, but death is one thing which is inevitable, and not even I can grant time when someone is due. You must come along now with me.\" He allowed his soul to leave his body, a tear running down his face as he did. I extended my arm to him and he obliged. If there is one final peace to the journey is the experience of seeing one's life pass by as I guide them to the next step. I saw, as we walked, countless people who David had helped, most of which he had n't known and would never see again. Every part of me wished to guide him back to his body, but I knew I had a task to fulfill, and I knew I had to complete it. After a long while of walking down the path, we finally came to the gateway where David would continue without my guidance. I never know where the person will go once they enter, but I knew David would go to a place that would have the same passion in death as he did in life. I never had such a hard time seeing someone move on, and I sat a while thinking of how tragic it is for someone like David, genuinely the best kind of person, to be taken from such a cruel world when he one of the few people who deserved to stay.

The first, a few hours before, sharply shrilled that it was time to get up and shower. Hungover and covered with the sweat and scents of the night before, I had dragged myself through the morning routine of cleansing. There was plenty of time beneath the lukewarm stream of water to contemplate the sadness of another hangover caused by drinking alone. It'd been weeks since I last had a chance to talk to another human, instead of just the PC terminal supplied by work. I towelled off and staggered through to the living-room and slumped in front of the computer, waiting for the piercing whistle to repeat, to emanate from my phone. The second alarm marked that it was time for the Remembrance. I sigh, move the empty beer bottles away from my desk and load up Hitchens 2. Since the Bliss neurovirus was released, there was a killing to be made from this sort of software; software designed to take you through a basic test, activating every faculty you'd conceivably need to prevent the atrophy. First, colour recognition and geometric shapes. Second, basic maths ramping into some gentle algebra and trigonometry. English, ethics, road safety, compassion testing, aesthetics, philosophical contemplation, the sciences. It was a hard sell at the beginning, for companies to give their employees the few hours off each morning they needed for the state-mandated testing, but given the choice between late employees and those in conscious comas, they made the right choice. Two hours later, the general test finishes. I flick through my results, 91 % recognition of the basic concepts, not too bad after a night of hard drinking. Next would come a quick half hour personal session: the names of loved ones, relations to family members, anniversaries and birthdays. A prompt flashes on the screen: \"Please enter your identity number and full name\". I rattle my digits in, 12958321-A, and tab down to the field for my name. I blank. Slight panic begins to grow as I search my beer-soaked consciousness for that basic, bloody basic, detail. It'd been too long since I last had to introduce myself with anything other than my work ID number, too long since I had any reason to say those damned words out loud. Darren? No. Christopher? No, definitely not. I shout and swear and blaspheme out loud, as I slowly feel the neurovirus go to work; Purgatory, we call it, a limbo without knowledge, tied with a purging. It dissolves me gently. The panic subsides. I stare blankly at the flashing cursor, waiting for me to enter some detail or another. I'm not sure what it's asking for, but I'm sure it's not too important or I'd remember it. I sit there, staring. Just staring.

Despite their best efforts, many of the recruits fail to meet the high standards set by Himmelstoss. Those who do manage to pass his tests are rewarded with praise and recognition, while those who fall short are subjected to harsh punishment. As the weeks go by, the recruits become increasingly frustrated and disillusioned with their situation. They begin to question the point of their training and wonder why they are being pushed to such extremes. One day, during a particularly grueling exercise, one of the recruits collapses from exhaustion. He is quickly revived by his comrades, but the incident serves as a wake-up call for the rest of the group. They realize that they must work together if they want to survive the rigors of basic training. From then on, the recruits form a tight-knit bond and support each other through the challenges ahead.

Before genes started mutating, before people received powers, before the world as he knew it ended. Things are different in the Today. We learnt it all during history in school. Mr T. brought us back to the Before and we had watched the wars, the starvation, the shootings, the massacres. Every child Today knows the story, because as some wise man in the Before had said, those who can not learn from history, are doomed to repeat it. And we don' t want that. We are lucky that the wars have ended as quickly as they begun. The Normals, like my grandfather, who were trying to kill those with powers were quickly put down by us. When my second cousin Sophia received her ability to bend the wills of others, grandfather had been most displeased. After all, it was one of the powers most feared back in the Before. Those with this ability were the ones who dominated and the wars had come. Countries fighting for dominance, millionaires waking up to find that they have signed away their fortune, men and women everywhere woke up to find that they have been doing things that they never would. It was then when the true Wars begun. Things are better Today though, people like Sophia are being kept safe. I haven' t seen her since she registered her powers two hours after she turned sixteen. Joshua, my older brother, had the ability to turn into a guinea pig. Grandfather was highly amused. It seemed though, that abilities are not hereditary. Father is a genius with technology while mother can heal with just a touch. I turn sixteen in a little less than two hours and I can' t wait to find out what my power is. It was the Law to register your abilities no more than two hours after you receive it. If you don' t, well, if you don' t, you might cease to exist. That was what we have been taught since those carefree days in preschool. They will hunt you down no matter how you try to hide. Uncle Kevin tried to hide Cousin Kingsley when they realized he could make people disappear. Well, they made Cousin Kingsley disappear. I just came into my powers.

Before genes started mutating, before people received powers, before the world as he knew it ended. Things are different in the Today. We learnt it all during history in school. Mr T. brought us back to the Before and we had watched the wars, the starvation, the shootings, the massacres. Every child Today knows the story, because as some wise man in the Before had said, those who can not learn from history, are doomed to repeat it. And we don' t want that. We are lucky that the wars have ended as quickly as they begun. The Normals, like my grandfather, who were trying to kill those with powers were quickly put down by us. When my second cousin Sophia received her ability to bend the wills of others, grandfather had been most displeased. After all, it was one of the powers most feared back in the Before. Those with this ability were the ones who dominated and the wars had come. Countries fighting for dominance, millionaires waking up to find that they have signed away their fortune, men and women everywhere woke up to find that they have been doing things that they never would. It was then when the true Wars begun. Things are better Today though, people like Sophia are being kept safe. I haven' t seen her since she registered her powers two hours after she turned sixteen. Joshua, my older brother, had the ability to turn into a guinea pig. Grandfather was highly amused. It seemed though, that abilities are not hereditary. Father is a genius with technology while mother can heal with just a touch. I turn sixteen in a little less than two hours and I can' t wait to find out what my power is. It was the Law to register your abilities no more than two hours after you receive it. If you don' t, well, if you don' t, you might cease to exist. That was what we have been taught since those carefree days in preschool. They will hunt you down no matter how you try to hide. Uncle Kevin tried to hide Cousin Kingsley when they realized he could make people disappear. Well, they made Cousin Kingsley disappear. I just came into my powers. Mother just made the most horrible sound, a hoarse, gutteral scream when I brushed by her in the cramped kitchen. She is still writhing on the ground, albeit silent.

It'd been weeks since I last had a chance to talk to another human, instead of just the PC terminal supplied by work.

He smiles back, but a little uncertain, he takes another look at my direction and says \"dude, why is your shirt bright, and I mean bright, pink\". Looking down at my grey shirt I sigh, I asked the lady at the store where I bought it, if it looked nice on me and was n't too bright. I'm sure it wo n't be the last joke someone will play on me. Indulging the stranger I quickly explain that my life is devoid of colour and to me everything looks grey.

I do n't know how to calm my mind, her dress is so bright it almost hurt's, her hair is darker then the dress but still far richer then anything that surrounds her. She looks at me and smiles, her teeth blind and her eye's are like bright spears that impale my soul. I heard the cashier make a off hand remark about her new green dress and I almost lose it. How can she be so calm and casual when talking about this colour green, her dress lights up my whole world and I felt a tear roll down my cheek. I know I ca n't wait, I ca n't live without this women, I need her colour. Getting up I make my way over, \"excuse me, miss, you are the most beautiful women in the whole world, nothing I have ever seen is close to what you are to me\" She smiles, but it does n't reach her eye's and my heart sinks. She makes some comment about her being flattered but she is already taken, grabs her coffee and goes. I'm now traveling home, and I watch the grey world pass by the window, I watch the blur of grey become one band of colour until I refocus my eye's. I walk home and enter my grey house and lay on my grey bed and all I can think of is that girl, who is she, where does she go, how can I get close to her, how can I keep her around me forever.

I saw my friends, family, strangers, all given the most precious thing in life. Lucy, my sweet dear sister, was able to fly to the heavens and back. Richard, my childhood best friend, saved hundreds of lives throughout his life, having the strength of ten men. And there I waited, for years, until my life could start, and I would transform into the real me... the powerful me. Yet, with each passing day, more people would discover their power, and I would sit waiting at night, forcing myself to sleep. My dreams were filled with possibilities, of flight and strength, and of mind and hope. But as the years passed, my dreams were less vivid. Not everyone is lucky enough to have their inner power. Some die before that beautiful gift is bestowed unto them. I thought that may happen to me. And I lived life for a while, depressed and alone. That was until I met her. Her name was Alison. She had a power, but chose not use it. She did not want to be defined by her single ability. We met during one of my travels, when I was touring the country trying to find meaning in life. I found it. I found her. From that point on, my life started. I did not care about being granted a special ability as much as I cared for her. I saw my future, a family, a wife, children. We created a beautiful life together. Alison passed away a few years ago. I had only asked her once what her power was, and she had told me it did not matter. As she was lying on her bed, slowly fading away, she told me what her inner power was. She said she was born with her power, that she had the ability to live forever, as long as she did not love. \"My power was a curse, until I found you\", she told me before she passed. Today is my 70th birthday. Today I have discovered what my power is. Old age has not been kind on me, and this is the most beautiful power I could have hoped for. When I remember my wife, the times we spent, they are not just memories any longer. I can feel the brisk of the air on the hill where we first met. I can smell the flowers. I can here her giggle, her breath against my cheek. In the little time I have left on this planet, I experience her love all over again.\n\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about 500 words in length:\nThe Seven Commandments of Animalism are established."

There, he finds a light bulb and decides to keep it hidden in his home. He begins to experiment with electricity and eventually creates a generator. His experiments lead him to discover the concept of individualism and the importance of personal freedom. He realizes that he must leave his community and find others who share his beliefs. In the end, Equality escapes from his society and joins a group of rebels who are fighting against the oppressive regime. Together, they work to create a new world where individuals can thrive and express their unique talents and abilities.\n\n",

It's now over one hundred fifty years since the birth of the first immortal. A young looking girl named Esther sat in a grassy field.

Several wars, booms in technology so astonishing that soon enough scientists said we were going to be making contact with celestial bodies outside of the solar system, and last of all the introduction of a drug you could take that would change every strand of your DNA.

Was it cruel to bring a mortal to life in the world of immortals? Immortals ruled the world and they certainly thought so. After the discovery that the drug had severe negative side effects the immortals wished to ban it as well, and so they did. It was illegal to produce it, sell it, possess it, and above all, illegal to have a child after having taken the drug. Esther had left her lab years early. She had given up on finding why they could n't fix the drug or reverse its effects. She moved out to the country, wishing she had never discovered it. The country was an expensive place to live due to the enormous population size humanity had reached, but she had more money than she would ever need.

I felt calm and serene, something I would never have expected. The awkward 0 looked at me with his dark eyes before sitting down... I felt terror... as his 0 slowly morphed into a dark and smoky 10. I left that experience behind me, but worked even harder to help others; I chose to become a prosecutor... to judge and serve justice to those who were evil. High numbers were a good indicator of evil, and it is my goal to eliminate evil. I regularly judged others based on their numbers, whether they were to be eliminated or not. Then one day, it happened. Those I judged to be evil started dying of heart attacks; sudden deaths flooded the world, and the number of criminals slowly starting reducing.

He works hard and tries to learn everything he can about the business. He also makes friends with some of the other employees. They are all very nice to him and help him out whenever they can. One day, Martin is working late in the office. It is getting dark outside and he decides to go home. As he leaves the building, he sees someone standing in the shadows. The person looks familiar but he cannot quite place them. He walks past them without saying anything. Suddenly, the person steps out of the shadows and grabs Martin by the arm. They tell him that they need to talk to him about something important. Martin is scared but he does not want to cause any trouble so he agrees to listen. The person tells him that they work for a rival company and that they have been following him for weeks. They say that they know everything",

I saw my friends, family, strangers, all given the most precious thing in life. Lucy, my sweet dear sister, was able to fly to the heavens and back.

She had a power, but chose not use it. She did not want to be defined by her single ability. We met during one of my travels, when I was touring the country trying to find meaning in life. I found it. I found her. From that point on, my life started. I did not care about being granted a special ability as much as I cared for her. I saw my future, a family, a wife, children. We created a beautiful life together. Alison passed away a few years ago. I had only asked her once what her power was, and she had told me it did not matter. As she was lying on her bed, slowly fading away, she told me what her inner power was. She said she was born with her power, that she had the ability to live forever, as long as she did not love. \"My power was a curse, until I found you\", she told me before she passed. Today is my 70th birthday. Today I have discovered what my power is. Old age has not been kind on me, and this is the most beautiful power I could have hoped for. When I remember my wife, the times we spent, they are not just memories any longer. I can feel the brisk of the air on the hill where we first met. I can smell the flowers. I can here her giggle, her breath against my cheek. In the little time I have left on this planet, I experience her love all over again.\n\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about 500 words in length:\nMartin falls in love with Leora Tozer."

Another day of studying droned on. It wasn' t that the material was a challenge, Naif had no problem absorbing every concept she came across and she had more degrees than anyone her age to prove it. Life had always been that way. In primary school she related better to adults than her classmates. In secondary school she was respectful of her teachers but felt she understood the lessons they taught to a deeper level than even they appreciated. University had been much the same except the distance between herself and her professors had turned her conscientious respect into a degree of begrudging disdain. She was certainly more intelligent than anyone she knew of, more so than anyone she had ever met. She picked apart the documents piled high on her desk recalling even the articles in the citations that she had previously read. Today her eyes were heavy, mostly with boredom, somewhat with the strain. Her mind was as sharp as it had ever been but her body showed the signs that she would not be considered a young woman for much longer. Through the closed windows she could vaguely hear the muffled hum of the world rushing by outside. Suddenly the monotony of the day fell away as it was unbound by a sharp thud against the outer wall of her office. Naif quickly straightened her hunched shoulders and bumped the table sloshing coffee over her meticulously curated stacks of research papers.

Spots of white clouds the orange-hued sky, as it slowly turns azure. Far in the distance, a silver tower, shrouded in mist, pierces the heavens above. The waves crash down on the sandy beaches, and the endless sea merges with the horizon. I take in the sights, the smells, the sounds. Feeling both pride and joy, I turn to face to you. The air is warm, but your hand is warmer. I hold it close to me, closer still. The sun is shining bright, but your smile is brighter. We' re standing at the top of our world, the one we made together, and I can' t tell you how happy this has made me. \"It' s almost time.\" You say. \"I know.\" I reply. I rest my head on your shoulder, and take a long breath as I close my eyes. I' m at peace here. When I opened them again, I was in my bed, and a bittersweet feeling of both tranquility and sadness lingered in my mind. It was around 7 a.m., and I went about my daily routine, a smile etched on my face. I wrote what had happened in a dream journal I had started two years ago. After having read about lucid dreaming, and I wanted to try it. It took some time, but one day, I was able to control the outcome of my dreams. After a few weeks, something changed. There was something else, maybe someone else, with me. I couldn' t control them, and they couldn' t control me. I searched about it in books and online, but no one reported something similar. I wasn' t afraid, though. Their presence was soothing. We rarely spoke, but when we did, it was always meaningful. Together, we started building a world, our dream island. It brought me joy, and above all, peace. This feeling of inner peace lived on with me during the day. The sun was racing across the sky as we strolled down the ruins of a castle. Holes and cracks had let nature overtake the walls and floors, and the ceiling had long since crumbled. We walked down an old throne room, and you turned to face me. It was so sudden, I nearly bumped into you. You looked resolute, and you said two simple words: \"Find me.\" I jolted awake. I knew what I had to do. I had to find you. So I searched, high and low, for days on end. Perhaps I thought it was fate, perhaps it was simply fool' s luck, but I felt as if I would eventually find you, if I kept trying. One evening, as if beckoned, I went in a coffee shop. I sat down with my coffee at an empty table, and looked up through the window at the red sky. Soon, someone came in, ordered the same thing as I did. They headed toward my table, and sat down in front of me, smiling brightly.

Forcing the enemy to rely on finite reserves is a good strategy. From our intel gathering and scouting missions we know the machines' first response will be to send two robots per every identified threat. Not a bad bit of logic on their part. The wolves were able to acquire video of some of the human assaults. We can confirm each localized machine hub will have, at minimum, 50000 robot responders. Luckily, we have some numbers. The machines decided not to bury the dead or finish off the wounded humans but to ship them away from the machine hubs. The wolf and bat armies grew after each human battle.

Forcing the enemy to rely on finite reserves is a good strategy. From our intel gathering and scouting missions we know the machines' first response will be to send two robots per every identified threat. Not a bad bit of logic on their part. The wolves were able to acquire video of some of the human assaults. We can confirm each localized machine hub will have, at minimum, 50000 robot responders. Luckily, we have some numbers. The machines decided not to bury the dead or finish off the wounded humans but to ship them away from the machine hubs. The wolf and bat armies grew after each human battle.

One day, while walking home from work, Frank sees a group of teenagers loitering outside the store. They are talking loudly and acting rowdy. Frank knows that if they enter the store, they will cause trouble and possibly steal something. He decides to intervene and try to talk some sense into them. As he approaches the group, he notices that one of the teens is carrying a baseball bat. Suddenly, the teen swings the bat at Frank, hitting him in the head. Frank falls to the ground, unconscious. When he wakes up, he finds himself in a strange room. There are four walls made of glass, and there is a bed in the center of the room. Frank realizes that he must be in a hospital.

He decides to take a loan from the bank to keep the store running. However, he soon realizes that the bank is not trustworthy and that he may lose everything. He tries to find a way to pay back the loan, but nothing seems to work. In desperation, he turns to crime and starts robbing banks. He becomes known as the \"Bank Robber\" and is hunted by the police. Despite being caught several times, he manages to escape and continue his criminal activities. Finally, after many years of struggle, he is arrested and sentenced to prison. There, he meets another prisoner named Harry, who helps him adjust to life behind bars.

Frank becomes close friends with the Bober family and feels like he has found a new home.

Along the way, they encounter many dangers and hardships, but they remain strong and determined to survive. Eventually, they reach a refugee camp where they are able to start rebuilding their lives. Despite the challenges they face, Frank remains grateful for the love and support of the Bober family and the other refugees in the camp.

Living in post-war Britain, death was not an uncommon sight. Everyone had at least one firearm to defend themselves, everyone had encountered gunfire in the streets, and everyone knew what it meant to live every day like it could be their last. The revolution that was supposed to end the tyranny of a dictatorship had ripped the country apart; counties had split into factions, all threatening total destruction of the others.

That morning, as I wandered to the local shop for some bread, clutching my rifle, my world completely ended.

My itchy, dirty clothes were replaced with beautiful white robes, soft as silk and cleaner than anything I had ever seen. I sat up, and looked around the room - it was furnished luxuriously, with beautiful gold-leaf chairs and fantastic bright works of art hanging around the room. I got up and left the room, and immediately my breath was forced from me. The crumbled grey streets of London had gone. In their place were beautiful old chalets, bright white skyscrapers, and marble streets. I could also see a very unfamiliar sight - a beautiful emerald park, littered with tall, radiant trees, ferns, and glowing coloured flowers. Clear water ran through them. All around the streets were people dressed similar to me, smiling and talking and laughing. The smog-ridden sky had been replaced with a beautiful, deep purple, but the world was light around me and the I could see the vast orange sun dipping behind the structures around the city.

Our planet, along with its some 7.8 billion population of people, have been forced to hide, or die trying. Many of us went underground, taking with us seeds and other animals to restart life if possible. We all new the odds of that though. After the first five years of preparation, we went into cryostasis, while a small population elected to stay and try and plot our course through the lonely emptiness of deep space. Needless to say, they succeeded, and they were bloody excited. Our Earth, with its surface now a comfortable -176 degrees Celsius, is on a hopeful course to the Andromeda Galaxy. We are approaching it very fast, but we believe that we will come within orbital distance and speed of at least twenty stars. And so we were awoken. Our planet, after a century of darkness, is starting to receive light from nearby stars. The boffs say that it still is only a full moon of light, but it's a change. Soon, we will pass by a red giant, and very closely. The boffs believe that it will be enough to start thawing out our cold, icy blue planet. The day has arrived. I am standing at the airlock, alongside my expeditionary unit. It's been a few days since we started our slingshot around the red giant, and the surface readings say that the temperature is stabilizing between -19 and 2 degrees. It's still cold, but it will be bearable, especially in our survival gear. We have packed 3 days of food. It's been a while since I've had a military ration pack, but the management thought it would be suitable to have one with our return to the surface. Everyone else has backed skis on their backpacks, but I've got my old snowboard kit with me. It was my passion before I left the surface. I stand here, before the airlock, googles on and pretty much looking like a... Like one of those puffy treats you roast on a stick over fire. I ca n't remember their name.

Everyone of them has lost something to the darkness, and everyone of them has determination to reclaim our planet and our lives. The air lock breaks, and a flood of air escapes and pours in.

But Dagny and Hank are determined to succeed. They hire the best engineers and workers to help them build the line. They also use the latest technology to make sure the project goes smoothly. Despite all of these efforts, however, there are still problems. There are delays, accidents, and even sabotage. But Dagny and Hank never give up. They keep working hard until the John Galt Line is finally completed. When it is finished, it is a marvel of engineering. It is the longest railroad line in the world, and it connects two coasts that were once separated by thousands of miles. The John Galt Line is a symbol of hope for America.

Looking down at my grey shirt I sigh, I asked the lady at the store where I bought it, if it looked nice on me and was n't too bright. I'm sure it wo n't be the last joke someone will play on me.

I do n't know how to calm my mind, her dress is so bright it almost hurt's, her hair is darker then the dress but still far richer then anything that surrounds her. She looks at me and smiles, her teeth blind and her eye's are like bright spears that impale my soul. I heard the cashier make a off hand remark about her new green dress and I almost lose it. How can she be so calm and casual when talking about this colour green, her dress lights up my whole world and I felt a tear roll down my cheek. I know I ca n't wait, I ca n't live without this women, I need her colour. Getting up I make my way over, \"excuse me, miss, you are the most beautiful women in the whole world, nothing I have ever seen is close to what you are to me\" She smiles, but it does n't reach her eye's and my heart sinks. She makes some comment about her being flattered but she is already taken, grabs her coffee and goes. I'm now traveling home, and I watch the grey world pass by the window, I watch the blur of grey become one band of colour until I refocus my eye's. I walk home and enter my grey house and lay on my grey bed and all I can think of is that girl, who is she, where does she go, how can I get close to her, how can I keep her around me forever.

Once there, she finds a job as a waitress in a small diner. The hours are long and the pay is low, but Taylor doesn't mind. She loves the hustle and bustle of the city and the people she meets.\n\nOne day, while taking a break from work, Taylor sees a flyer advertising a free concert in Central Park. She decides to check it out and is blown away by the music. It's unlike anything she's ever heard before. The singer has a powerful voice and the lyrics are moving. As she listens, Taylor feels a connection to the music and the artist. She knows she has to meet him.\n\nAfter the concert, Taylor approaches the singer and introduces herself. He's surprised to learn that she's from Kentucky and even more surprised to hear that she's never heard his music before. They strike up a conversation and soon find themselves falling",

All around the streets were people dressed similar to me, smiling and talking and laughing. The smog-ridden sky had been replaced with a beautiful, deep purple, but the world was light around me and the I could see the vast orange sun dipping behind the structures around the city.

I saw my friends, family, strangers, all given the most precious thing in life. Lucy, my sweet dear sister, was able to fly to the heavens and back. Richard, my childhood best friend, saved hundreds of lives throughout his life, having the strength of ten men. And there I waited, for years, until my life could start, and I would transform into the real me... the powerful me. Yet, with each passing day, more people would discover their power, and I would sit waiting at night, forcing myself to sleep. My dreams were filled with possibilities, of flight and strength, and of mind and hope. But as the years passed, my dreams were less vivid. Not everyone is lucky enough to have their inner power. Some die before that beautiful gift is bestowed unto them. I thought that may happen to me. And I lived life for a while, depressed and alone. That was until I met her. Her name was Alison. She had a power, but chose not use it. She did not want to be defined by her single ability. We met during one of my travels, when I was touring the country trying to find meaning in life. I found it. I found her. From that point on, my life started. I did not care about being granted a special ability as much as I cared for her. I saw my future, a family, a wife, children. We created a beautiful life together. Alison passed away a few years ago. I had only asked her once what her power was, and she had told me it did not matter. As she was lying on her bed, slowly fading away, she told me what her inner power was. She said she was born with her power, that she had the ability to live forever, as long as she did not love. \"My power was a curse, until I found you\", she told me before she passed. Today is my 70th birthday. Today I have discovered what my power is. Old age has not been kind on me, and this is the most beautiful power I could have hoped for. When I remember my wife, the times we spent, they are not just memories any longer. I can feel the brisk of the air on the hill where we first met. I can smell the flowers. I can here her giggle, her breath against my cheek.

Taylor tries to run, but the men are too fast. They catch up to him and beat him unconscious. When Taylor wakes up, he finds himself tied up to a tree.

The dawn of a new day, when humans thought to sneak up on the Deep Woods Dragon while it slept. It feared the way the sun reflected off of it' s scales, they said. It' s prismatic hide was so bright it was blinding. If taunted into the sun, they said, the Deep Woods Dragon could be defeated by the least trained of knights. The Deep Woods Dragon needed to be blinded, they said, or it would burn its attackers to ashes with rainbow-hued flames. He knew these rumors because the butterflies had told him. They were drawn to the rainbow of greens, yellows, pinks and purples of his scales, like the flowers they coveted so much. They had told him this, too, but the Dragon did not mind. The butterflies were honest, as their lives were short and beautiful. Even still, they could fly unhindered among the humans, even admired by the small humans who chased them, laughing. They told him stories while they rested on his wingtips, tail, and snout. Butterflies did not fear the Dragon, because they knew the truth. With a yawn, the Dragon shifted its weight to better perch itself on the tree' s stout branch. This tree was taller than the others, and overlooked a small, circular clearing. Without the deer, the weeds thrived, covering the dirt in a green, tangled mass. At the edge of the clearing stood a massive cave entrance, vines draped over the sides of smooth rock. The Dragon had snapped off the vines in front of the entrance, to give the illusion of occupancy. This was, after all, where the humans thought he lived. He knew these rumors because the butterflies had told him. \"In an ancient cave in the middle of the wood, lives an ancient dragon who' s up to no good!\" That was what the small humans like to chant as they chased the butterflies and laughed. So the Dragon tore at the vines, and scared the graceful deer from the peaceful clearing. He had enjoyed watching the deer with their young as they grazed the clearing. From up above in his favorite tree, they could not see him, and they could not fear him. Three times a day, the Dragon glided down from his tree to the old cave' s opening. There, he took a deep breath and screamed as loud as he could. He cried in both low tones and high pitches. He wailed in imitation of female humans, shouted in a voice mimicking angry male humans. The Dragon stood on top of the cave and breathed eye-searing beams of light from his mouth to the sky. It scared the birds huddled in the trees, and the noises scared the deer far from the clearing. But they also scared the humans away from the Deep Woods. He knew these rumors because the butterflies had told him. So he made his noises, made the lights, and scared the humans away. Because any humans who saw the Dragon would discover the truth. Because, when the Dragon stepped into the sunlight, they' d see how small he really was. The Deep Woods Dragon, with prismatic scales that shone in the sun and such a frightening voice, was the size of a domestic house cat. And only the butterflies knew the truth.\n\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about 500 words in length:\nEsther Greenwood wins an internship at Ladies Day magazine in New York."

The Dragon stood on top of the cave and breathed eye-searing beams of light from his mouth to the sky. It scared the birds huddled in the trees, and the noises scared the deer far from the clearing. But they also scared the humans away from the Deep Woods. He knew these rumors because the butterflies had told him. So he made his noises, made the lights, and scared the humans away. Because any humans who saw the Dragon would discover the truth. Because, when the Dragon stepped into the sunlight, they' d see how small he really was. The Deep Woods Dragon, with prismatic scales that shone in the sun and such a frightening voice, was the size of a domestic house cat. And only the butterflies knew the truth.\n\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about 500 words in length:\nEsther Greenwood wins an internship at Ladies Day magazine in New York.",

Spots of white clouds the orange-hued sky, as it slowly turns azure. Far in the distance, a silver tower, shrouded in mist, pierces the heavens above. The waves crash down on the sandy beaches, and the endless sea merges with the horizon. I take in the sights, the smells, the sounds. Feeling both pride and joy, I turn to face to you. The air is warm, but your hand is warmer. I hold it close to me, closer still. The sun is shining bright, but your smile is brighter. We' re standing at the top of our world, the one we made together, and I can' t tell you how happy this has made me. \"It' s almost time.\" You say. \"I know.\" I reply.

I wasn' t afraid, though. Their presence was soothing. We rarely spoke, but when we did, it was always meaningful. Together, we started building a world, our dream island. It brought me joy, and above all, peace. This feeling of inner peace lived on with me during the day. The sun was racing across the sky as we strolled down the ruins of a castle.

She takes a walk around the city, enjoying the fresh air and the sights. As she walks, she notices a man following her. He seems to be trying to hide his face, but Esther can still see him clearly. She quickens her pace, but he keeps up with her. Finally, she turns around and confronts him. \"What are you doing?\" she asks. \"I'm sorry,\" he says. \"I didn't mean to scare you.\" \"Then why are you following me?\" Esther demands. \"I just want to talk to you,\" he replies. \"About what?\" \"About your work,\" he says. \"I think you're amazing.\" Esther is taken aback.

The soft rays bathe the distant hills in gold, as the breeze blows through the dancing grass. The trees shivers as flock of birds take flight. Spots of white clouds the orange-hued sky, as it slowly turns azure. Far in the distance, a silver tower, shrouded in mist, pierces the heavens above. The waves crash down on the sandy beaches, and the endless sea merges with the horizon. I take in the sights, the smells, the sounds. Feeling both pride and joy, I turn to face to you. The air is warm, but your hand is warmer. I hold it close to me, closer still. The sun is shining bright, but your smile is brighter. We' re standing at the top of our world, the one we made together, and I can' t tell you how happy this has made me. \"It' s almost time.\" You say. \"I know.\" I reply. I rest my head on your shoulder, and take a long breath as I close my eyes. I' m at peace here. When I opened them again, I was in my bed, and a bittersweet feeling of both tranquility and sadness lingered in my mind.

After having read about lucid dreaming, and I wanted to try it. It took some time, but one day, I was able to control the outcome of my dreams. After a few weeks, something changed. There was something else, maybe someone else, with me. I couldn' t control them, and they couldn' t control me. I searched about it in books and online, but no one reported something similar. I wasn' t afraid, though. Their presence was soothing. We rarely spoke, but when we did, it was always meaningful. Together, we started building a world, our dream island. It brought me joy, and above all, peace. This feeling of inner peace lived on with me during the day. The sun was racing across the sky as we strolled down the ruins of a castle. Holes and cracks had let nature overtake the walls and floors, and the ceiling had long since crumbled. We walked down an old throne room, and you turned to face me. It was so sudden, I nearly bumped into you. You looked resolute, and you said two simple words: \"Find me.\" I jolted awake. I knew what I had to do. I had to find you. So I searched, high and low, for days on end. Perhaps I thought it was fate, perhaps it was simply fool' s luck, but I felt as if I would eventually find you, if I kept trying. One evening, as if beckoned, I went in a coffee shop. I sat down with my coffee at an empty table, and looked up through the window at the red sky. Soon, someone came in, ordered the same thing as I did. They headed toward my table, and sat down in front of me, smiling brightly.

However, she soon realizes that she's not the only one who's been affected by the food poisoning. Many of the other contestants are also sick, and some of them may even die.

He wants freedom more than anything else in the world. So one night, he leads his fellow slaves into the woods. They run as fast as they can, but they know that the guards will catch them soon.

Another day of studying droned on. It wasn' t that the material was a challenge, Naif had no problem absorbing every concept she came across and she had more degrees than anyone her age to prove it. Life had always been that way. In primary school she related better to adults than her classmates. In secondary school she was respectful of her teachers but felt she understood the lessons they taught to a deeper level than even they appreciated. University had been much the same except the distance between herself and her professors had turned her conscientious respect into a degree of begrudging disdain. She was certainly more intelligent than anyone she knew of, more so than anyone she had ever met. She picked apart the documents piled high on her desk recalling even the articles in the citations that she had previously read. Today her eyes were heavy, mostly with boredom, somewhat with the strain. Her mind was as sharp as it had ever been but her body showed the signs that she would not be considered a young woman for much longer. Through the closed windows she could vaguely hear the muffled hum of the world rushing by outside. Suddenly the monotony of the day fell away as it was unbound by a sharp thud against the outer wall of her office. Naif quickly straightened her hunched shoulders and bumped the table sloshing coffee over her meticulously curated stacks of research papers. She snarled impatiently at the mess and sprang to the window. She squinted through the blinds at the sunlit scene then furrowed them even further in annoyance. The neighbours were playing baseball with their kids again. Idiots. Hadn' t they any respect for others? One of the little morons ran up to the edge of Naif's apartment, beneath her field of view, and tried to throw the ball back. It careened off course and the cretin had to go pick it up again to return it to his waiting family. Naif rolled her eyes as she turned away from the display of incompetence and inefficiency that played out beyond her walls. As she sopped up the spilled coffee from her desk she mumbled to herself, as she had before, \"I wish everyone were more intelligent. I would have so much more to share with them, so much more in common. They run around all day never thinking of their actions, of their futures. Such wasted potential in all that frivolity.\" Though as she settled back into her comfortably worn chair she couldn' t help feeling that there was something more to it that she just didn' t quite understand.\n\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about 500 words in length:\nBilly is admonished for petty errors, surprising him."

Naif quickly straightened her hunched shoulders and bumped the table sloshing coffee over her meticulously curated stacks of research papers. She snarled impatiently at the mess and sprang to the window. She squinted through the blinds at the sunlit scene then furrowed them even further in annoyance. The neighbours were playing baseball with their kids again. Idiots. Hadn' t they any respect for others? One of the little morons ran up to the edge of Naif's apartment, beneath her field of view, and tried to throw the ball back. It careened off course and the cretin had to go pick it up again to return it to his waiting family. Naif rolled her eyes as she turned away from the display of incompetence and inefficiency that played out beyond her walls. As she sopped up the spilled coffee from her desk she mumbled to herself, as she had before, \"I wish everyone were more intelligent. I would have so much more to share with them, so much more in common. They run around all day never thinking of their actions, of their futures. Such wasted potential in all that frivolity.\" Though as she settled back into her comfortably worn chair she couldn' t help feeling that there was something more to it that she just didn' t quite understand.\n\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about 500 words in length:\nBilly is admonished for petty errors, surprising him.",

He wonders why he isn't given more responsibility. He decides to take matters into his own hands. He starts making changes without telling anyone. He makes sure everything is done right.

The dawn of a new day, when humans thought to sneak up on the Deep Woods Dragon while it slept. It feared the way the sun reflected off of it' s scales, they said. It' s prismatic hide was so bright it was blinding. If taunted into the sun, they said, the Deep Woods Dragon could be defeated by the least trained of knights. The Deep Woods Dragon needed to be blinded, they said, or it would burn its attackers to ashes with rainbow-hued flames. He knew these rumors because the butterflies had told him. They were drawn to the rainbow of greens, yellows, pinks and purples of his scales, like the flowers they coveted so much. They had told him this, too, but the Dragon did not mind. The butterflies were honest, as their lives were short and beautiful. Even still, they could fly unhindered among the humans, even admired by the small humans who chased them, laughing. They told him stories while they rested on his wingtips, tail, and snout. Butterflies did not fear the Dragon, because they knew the truth. With a yawn, the Dragon shifted its weight to better perch itself on the tree' s stout branch. This tree was taller than the others, and overlooked a small, circular clearing. Without the deer, the weeds thrived, covering the dirt in a green, tangled mass. At the edge of the clearing stood a massive cave entrance, vines draped over the sides of smooth rock. The Dragon had snapped off the vines in front of the entrance, to give the illusion of occupancy. This was, after all, where the humans thought he lived. He knew these rumors because the butterflies had told him. \"In an ancient cave in the middle of the wood, lives an ancient dragon who' s up to no good!\" That was what the small humans like to chant as they chased the butterflies and laughed. So the Dragon tore at the vines, and scared the graceful deer from the peaceful clearing. He had enjoyed watching the deer with their young as they grazed the clearing. From up above in his favorite tree, they could not see him, and they could not fear him. Three times a day, the Dragon glided down from his tree to the old cave' s opening. There, he took a deep breath and screamed as loud as he could. He cried in both low tones and high pitches. He wailed in imitation of female humans, shouted in a voice mimicking angry male humans. The Dragon stood on top of the cave and breathed eye-searing beams of light from his mouth to the sky. It scared the birds huddled in the trees, and the noises scared the deer far from the clearing.

The dawn of a new day, when humans thought to sneak up on the Deep Woods Dragon while it slept. It feared the way the sun reflected off of it' s scales, they said. It' s prismatic hide was so bright it was blinding. If taunted into the sun, they said, the Deep Woods Dragon could be defeated by the least trained of knights. The Deep Woods Dragon needed to be blinded, they said, or it would burn its attackers to ashes with rainbow-hued flames. He knew these rumors because the butterflies had told him. They were drawn to the rainbow of greens, yellows, pinks and purples of his scales, like the flowers they coveted so much. They had told him this, too, but the Dragon did not mind. The butterflies were honest, as their lives were short and beautiful. Even still, they could fly unhindered among the humans, even admired by the small humans who chased them, laughing. They told him stories while they rested on his wingtips, tail, and snout. Butterflies did not fear the Dragon, because they knew the truth. With a yawn, the Dragon shifted its weight to better perch itself on the tree' s stout branch. This tree was taller than the others, and overlooked a small, circular clearing. Without the deer, the weeds thrived, covering the dirt in a green, tangled mass. At the edge of the clearing stood a massive cave entrance, vines draped over the sides of smooth rock. The Dragon had snapped off the vines in front of the entrance, to give the illusion of occupancy. This was, after all, where the humans thought he lived. He knew these rumors because the butterflies had told him. \"In an ancient cave in the middle of the wood, lives an ancient dragon who' s up to no good!\" That was what the small humans like to chant as they chased the butterflies and laughed. So the Dragon tore at the vines, and scared the graceful deer from the peaceful clearing. He had enjoyed watching the deer with their young as they grazed the clearing. From up above in his favorite tree, they could not see him, and they could not fear him. Three times a day, the Dragon glided down from his tree to the old cave' s opening. There, he took a deep breath and screamed as loud as he could. He cried in both low tones and high pitches. He wailed in imitation of female humans, shouted in a voice mimicking angry male humans. The Dragon stood on top of the cave and breathed eye-searing beams of light from his mouth to the sky. It scared the birds huddled in the trees, and the noises scared the deer far from the clearing. But they also scared the humans away from the Deep Woods. He knew these rumors because the butterflies had told him. So he made his noises, made the lights, and scared the humans away. Because any humans who saw the Dragon would discover the truth. Because, when the Dragon stepped into the sunlight, they' d see how small he really was.

        "output": " His father is a medicine man, and Black Elk has been chosen to follow in his footsteps. As he grows older, he learns more about the ways of the Lakota people, and becomes a great warrior. However, he is haunted by the voices, which tell him that he must lead his people to victory against the white men. When the Battle of Little Bighorn takes place, Black Elk leads his people to victory, but at a terrible cost. Many of his friends and family are killed, including his beloved wife. Black Elk is left alone, with only the voices to keep him company. He spends the rest of his life wandering the plains, searching for meaning in the world around him. In the end, he finds peace in the knowledge that he has done everything he can to help his people. Black Elk's story is one of courage, sacrifice, and redemption. It is a reminder that even in the darkest of times, there is always hope.\n\n",

I saw my friends, family, strangers, all given the most precious thing in life. Lucy, my sweet dear sister, was able to fly to the heavens and back. Richard, my childhood best friend, saved hundreds of lives throughout his life, having the strength of ten men. And there I waited, for years, until my life could start, and I would transform into the real me... the powerful me. Yet, with each passing day, more people would discover their power, and I would sit waiting at night, forcing myself to sleep. My dreams were filled with possibilities, of flight and strength, and of mind and hope. But as the years passed, my dreams were less vivid. Not everyone is lucky enough to have their inner power. Some die before that beautiful gift is bestowed unto them. I thought that may happen to me. And I lived life for a while, depressed and alone. That was until I met her. Her name was Alison. She had a power, but chose not use it. She did not want to be defined by her single ability. We met during one of my travels, when I was touring the country trying to find meaning in life. I found it. I found her. From that point on, my life started. I did not care about being granted a special ability as much as I cared for her. I saw my future, a family, a wife, children. We created a beautiful life together. Alison passed away a few years ago. I had only asked her once what her power was, and she had told me it did not matter. As she was lying on her bed, slowly fading away, she told me what her inner power was. She said she was born with her power, that she had the ability to live forever, as long as she did not love. \"My power was a curse, until I found you\", she told me before she passed. Today is my 70th birthday. Today I have discovered what my power is. Old age has not been kind on me, and this is the most beautiful power I could have hoped for. When I remember my wife, the times we spent, they are not just memories any longer. I can feel the brisk of the air on the hill where we first met. I can smell the flowers. I can here her giggle, her breath against my cheek.

Another day of studying droned on. It wasn' t that the material was a challenge, Naif had no problem absorbing every concept she came across and she had more degrees than anyone her age to prove it. Life had always been that way. In primary school she related better to adults than her classmates. In secondary school she was respectful of her teachers but felt she understood the lessons they taught to a deeper level than even they appreciated. University had been much the same except the distance between herself and her professors had turned her conscientious respect into a degree of begrudging disdain. She was certainly more intelligent than anyone she knew of, more so than anyone she had ever met.

Another day of studying droned on. It wasn' t that the material was a challenge, Naif had no problem absorbing every concept she came across and she had more degrees than anyone her age to prove it. Life had always been that way. In primary school she related better to adults than her classmates. In secondary school she was respectful of her teachers but felt she understood the lessons they taught to a deeper level than even they appreciated. University had been much the same except the distance between herself and her professors had turned her conscientious respect into a degree of begrudging disdain. She was certainly more intelligent than anyone she knew of, more so than anyone she had ever met. She picked apart the documents piled high on her desk recalling even the articles in the citations that she had previously read.

Living in post-war Britain, death was not an uncommon sight. Everyone had at least one firearm to defend themselves, everyone had encountered gunfire in the streets, and everyone knew what it meant to live every day like it could be their last. The revolution that was supposed to end the tyranny of a dictatorship had ripped the country apart; counties had split into factions, all threatening total destruction of the others. In ten years the population was decimated, the country reduced to a crumbling mass of fallen buildings and civilians with guns. All around me was depression, death, dirt, famine.

That morning, as I wandered to the local shop for some bread, clutching my rifle, my world completely ended. I had no time to react; as soon as I entered Grange Avenue a bullet burrowed into my head, smashing part of my brain, and knocking me straight out cold. I woke in a beautiful wooden chalet, bright natural light streaming through vast windows above the soft, clean bed that I rested in. My itchy, dirty clothes were replaced with beautiful white robes, soft as silk and cleaner than anything I had ever seen. I sat up, and looked around the room - it was furnished luxuriously, with beautiful gold-leaf chairs and fantastic bright works of art hanging around the room. I got up and left the room, and immediately my breath was forced from me. The crumbled grey streets of London had gone. In their place were beautiful old chalets, bright white skyscrapers, and marble streets. I could also see a very unfamiliar sight - a beautiful emerald park, littered with tall, radiant trees, ferns, and glowing coloured flowers. Clear water ran through them. All around the streets were people dressed similar to me, smiling and talking and laughing. The smog-ridden sky had been replaced with a beautiful, deep purple, but the world was light around me and the I could see the vast orange sun dipping behind the structures around the city. For the first time in ten years I smiled.

When he gets to school, he sees a big building with lots of kids running around. He walks inside and finds his classroom. There are lots of desks and chairs, and a teacher is standing at the front of the class. Antonio sits down at a desk and waits for the teacher to start the lesson. The teacher introduces herself and asks everyone to introduce themselves. Antonio raises his hand and says \"Hi, my name is Antonio.\" The teacher smiles and says \"Welcome to our class, Antonio!\" Antonio feels happy and excited. He starts to feel less nervous.

The office towers lighting up in the evening haze and the smeary pale of a cloudless sunset. The tiny headlights of cars with sweaty passengers unseen, idling in traffic, smelling the hot food cooking in restaurants. The world shifts as the woman behind the camera adjusts her footing, muttering in English to her boyfriend. A light like the sun over the horizon, there and then gone. Silence, but for the wind in the trees. She asks what that was. The clean, shaved, washed, waxed people in suits at desks read facts and information like sports commentary. They narrate animations with moving arrows and lines like football plays. They report on characters and captains. They discuss. They debate. They nod solemnly. The light flashes in the sky and fades but the afterglow remains. They update, they check-in, they go-live, they re-Tweet. Wounded civilians scream and coddle loved ones, rewind. Look right here: loved ones die. Rewind. The light like the sun. Stay tuned. A city, its mountains. The office buildings lighting up in evening haze. Tiny headlights and unseen drivers thinking about food. A mutter in the sunset. A light and its afterglow. The wind in the trees. The troops are bad cameramen. They laugh or they scream or they joke nervously. Trucks and tanks and armoured vehicles on tall tires carry them down empty roads where sometimes cars have been abandoned or craters from bad arty shots force detours. The videos capture the sounds of war. Pops and crackles of overhead bullets. The shake and snapping of stalks and branches. Rivers idling over rounded stones. The scritchety clatter of the camera tumbling after bomb concussion shreds the canopies and dust swirls in mottled sunlight. Winged insects flashing momentarily in their arcs. A city, its mountains. Buildings, drivers. Sunset. A light. People speak in hushed tones. Somewhere, over the horizon on the other side of the world, everything has changed. There are no videos of the darkness that came afterward. A light like the sun. A motorcyclist pulls over to the side of the road in the clear, humid evening and reaches down to turn the petcock to OFF before quieting the motor. She's out in the country, flat fields of corn and wheat on either side of the old road. Above her the stars are out and bright in the sky. One of them, brighter than the rest, moves slowly toward the Earth's penumbra. The rider flips up her visor and sits back, hands behind her on the seat, watching the little light move, thinking of the people inside looking back. When those astronauts look down at Seoul, what do they see? The light fades and she is left alone. She listens and hears only crickets and a soft waxy rustle of a breeze in the corn. No guns, no artillery. No marching. No wet gasps from ruined faces. She shifts and works a hand into her pocket, pulling out a phone made in South Korea. She wonders if the people who screwed and soldered its pieces together are still alive, whether they could have seen the flash from wherever they were. Her friend has texted her, asking when she will get to the party. She responds with \"A few minutes\" and puts the phone away. The bike starts up fine once it's warm and after a moment of further staring into the stars she kicks the engine over and rolls away. The bright red of her tail light flashes as she slows at the intersection, then winks out.\n\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about 500 words in length:\nAntonio witnesses the death of Lupito."

Then I noticed something odd. It was n't immediately noticeable. It might have been happening in previous lives, in even less conspicuous ways, but I found it on my nose. A voxel. It was disconcerting, but not terribly so. A little extra skin and an odd right-angle was n't something to make me question my latest biological vehicle, but I did wonder what would happen if it had happened in, say, my eye. A bullet through the head and I was back in the machine. After the standard checks, I tried to find a superficial voxel somewhere. This time it was a whole cube of extra skin on my upper arm, a few millimeters across. Now I started wondering if voxels could go missing instead of being added - and I started wondering if they could be missing internally. The tests continued. This time I was dropped unceremoniously into a small vat of fluoroantimonic acid - I barely had time to register pain before I chemically ceased to exist. When I woke up, voxels were the first thing I checked for. Nothing on my face, or my arms... But on my side there was a large raised spot, with right-angled edges. But there was little time to worry about my volumetric resolution - the next test was explosive. Alive again, I looked for voxellation. To my growing concern, it was spreading. Like square tumors, the voxels showed up in patches on my arms, legs, and torso. I hoped they would n't reach my... Higher-resolution areas. After the decompression test, the voxels were in all sorts of places. I started to feel like a combination of human and LEGO. They were n't impeding me in any way, but it was bizarre having irregular rectangular growths all over. They were pretty obvious from even a glance, but the tests continued. Death by rapid incineration. Voxels on my shins. Death by a laser through the heart. Voxels on my back. Death by electrocution. Voxels on my shoulders. I was still functioning perfectly - the voxels did n't seem to be happening to anything inside me. After a while I got used to them - I formed a habit of checking where my voxel patches had randomly generated with each \"respawn\". Eventually it had to happen. I awoke and found it mechanically difficult to extricate myself from the machine. A cursory examination revealed that my entire exterior surface was voxellated to a resolution of three millimeters. There was a fuss, and argument, and huddled discussion. Eventually someone noticed me standing around being extraordinarily Cartesian and told me to get back into the machine. It was just like dying - at least, like the particularly quick deaths. When I woke up, I had my contours back - you could say my resolution was molecular. It was refreshing not to have to worry about being compared to an old videogame.

He wakes up every morning, goes to work, comes home, eats dinner, watches TV, goes to bed. And then repeats the cycle the next day. Antonio feels trapped in this endless loop, unable to break free from the monotony of his existence. One night, as he lies awake in bed, he hears a voice calling out to him. At first, he thinks it's just his imagination playing tricks on him, but when he gets up to investigate, he finds himself standing in front of a mysterious figure. The figure introduces itself as the Angel of Destiny, and tells Antonio that he has come to show him the path to true happiness. The Angel leads Antonio on a journey through time and space, showing him the many different paths his life could have taken. Antonio sees himself as a successful businessman, a famous artist, and even",

The toys did n't need a second prompt. The strong man and Mr. Potato head grabbed the monkeys in a barrel, hopped in RC and gunned the engines. The army men attempted to rescue some of the less mobile toys, but it was too late. One brilliant child had the idea to grab my waist with his sweaty, greasy hand and hold me up in the air. I put up a fight, hoping to distract them enough to let everyone escape. I did n't know what would happen, but panic had overrun my emotions and pure terror coursed through my plastic veins. But then, salvation.

I propelled myself towards the window, clear through the slit. The other toys were already at the edge of the law waiting for me, but I had to look back at least once.

Pecola is a victim of racism and sexism. She is also a victim of her own imagination. She believes that if she has blue eyes, she will be happy and loved. However, her prayers go unanswered and she remains unhappy and unloved. Pecola's story is a tragic one, but it is also a cautionary tale. It reminds us that we should not judge people by their appearance, and that we should treat others with kindness and compassion.\n",

It was disconcerting, but not terribly so. A little extra skin and an odd right-angle was n't something to make me question my latest biological vehicle, but I did wonder what would happen if it had happened in, say, my eye. A bullet through the head and I was back in the machine. After the standard checks, I tried to find a superficial voxel somewhere. This time it was a whole cube of extra skin on my upper arm, a few millimeters across. Now I started wondering if voxels could go missing instead of being added - and I started wondering if they could be missing internally. The tests continued. This time I was dropped unceremoniously into a small vat of fluoroantimonic acid - I barely had time to register pain before I chemically ceased to exist. When I woke up, voxels were the first thing I checked for. Nothing on my face, or my arms... But on my side there was a large raised spot, with right-angled edges. But there was little time to worry about my volumetric resolution - the next test was explosive. Alive again, I looked for voxellation. To my growing concern, it was spreading. Like square tumors, the voxels showed up in patches on my arms, legs, and torso. I hoped they would n't reach my... Higher-resolution areas. After the decompression test, the voxels were in all sorts of places. I started to feel like a combination of human and LEGO. They were n't impeding me in any way, but it was bizarre having irregular rectangular growths all over. They were pretty obvious from even a glance, but the tests continued. Death by rapid incineration. Voxels on my shins. Death by a laser through the heart. Voxels on my back. Death by electrocution. Voxels on my shoulders. I was still functioning perfectly - the voxels did n't seem to be happening to anything inside me. After a while I got used to them - I formed a habit of checking where my voxel patches had randomly generated with each \"respawn\". Eventually it had to happen. I awoke and found it mechanically difficult to extricate myself from the machine. A cursory examination revealed that my entire exterior surface was voxellated to a resolution of three millimeters. There was a fuss, and argument, and huddled discussion. Eventually someone noticed me standing around being extraordinarily Cartesian and told me to get back into the machine. It was just like dying - at least, like the particularly quick deaths. When I woke up, I had my contours back - you could say my resolution was molecular.

Contemplating my life as it were. So many memories I wanted to share with you. Diamonds for my one true love. Do you remember that one cool summer evening half a lifetime ago? We nestled ourselves against each other on the blanket in the park. I can still feel your skin against mine as we watched the fireworks together. Your chestnut hair stroking my cheek and ear as you rested your head on my shoulder. I could n't believe you were gone. Day turned into night. Food tasted like nothing. The world turned into a bland grey color. I could n't believe it. I did n't want to believe it. I wept and kept weeping. Then I had no tears left to sob. I lost weight. I lost my hair. I gained wrinkles. When I lost you, the man in the mirror showed me his true age almost overnight. But then things started to change. Our Elisabeth. Our loving, kind Lillibeth who moved half a world for her Australian. She visited me eventually. We talked about you, Lily. We shared a thousand little things between us. A flock of starlings composing your life. During that visit, the turmoil caused by losing you finally seemed to settle. At the end, I decided to finally change my Facebook status. Lillibeth helped me. You know my old, bony fingers have gotten a mind of their own, it seems. I wanted to tell you, Lilly, that I got a little surprise the very next day. This tabby kitten sat outside our garden door the very next morning. It seemed lost, but her eyes betrayed she knew exactly were she was. As I opened the door, she jumped right in and installed herself in the spot on the couch from where you used to watch the telly during long winter evenings. I decided to dub her Lilly because she seems to have a playful streak. Just like you. And most importantly, she seemed to be the antidote to my loneliness. That's not the end of it. Lily was only the first. Each week, I woke up to find two or three feline friends at our garden door. I let them, fed them and started to call them by a name I gave them. Each of them seemingly knowing that she belonged in this house. There's Athena who sits on your sewing machine, looking wise beyond her years. There's Hera who likes to wake me up each morning, and has this stern and down-to-earth disposition. There's Hebe, she's just a kitten who seems to have no bounds teasing the others. All in all, there's twelve of them who came to live with me. They keep me company. Follow me through the house as I go about my day. When I see them, they always remind me of a part of you. An aspect that I should n't forget. Sometimes they're mere presence helps me as the practicalities in life start to fade from my memory.

Contemplating my life as it were. So many memories I wanted to share with you. Diamonds for my one true love. Do you remember that one cool summer evening half a lifetime ago? We nestled ourselves against each other on the blanket in the park. I can still feel your skin against mine as we watched the fireworks together. Your chestnut hair stroking my cheek and ear as you rested your head on my shoulder. I could n't believe you were gone. Day turned into night. Food tasted like nothing. The world turned into a bland grey color. I could n't believe it. I did n't want to believe it. I wept and kept weeping. Then I had no tears left to sob. I lost weight. I lost my hair. I gained wrinkles. When I lost you, the man in the mirror showed me his true age almost overnight. But then things started to change. Our Elisabeth. Our loving, kind Lillibeth who moved half a world for her Australian. She visited me eventually. We talked about you, Lily. We shared a thousand little things between us. A flock of starlings composing your life. During that visit, the turmoil caused by losing you finally seemed to settle. At the end, I decided to finally change my Facebook status. Lillibeth helped me. You know my old, bony fingers have gotten a mind of their own, it seems. I wanted to tell you, Lilly, that I got a little surprise the very next day. This tabby kitten sat outside our garden door the very next morning. It seemed lost, but her eyes betrayed she knew exactly were she was. As I opened the door, she jumped right in and installed herself in the spot on the couch from where you used to watch the telly during long winter evenings. I decided to dub her Lilly because she seems to have a playful streak. Just like you. And most importantly, she seemed to be the antidote to my loneliness. That's not the end of it. Lily was only the first. Each week, I woke up to find two or three feline friends at our garden door. I let them, fed them and started to call them by a name I gave them. Each of them seemingly knowing that she belonged in this house. There's Athena who sits on your sewing machine, looking wise beyond her years. There's Hera who likes to wake me up each morning, and has this stern and down-to-earth disposition. There's Hebe, she's just a kitten who seems to have no bounds teasing the others. All in all, there's twelve of them who came to live with me. They keep me company. Follow me through the house as I go about my day. When I see them, they always remind me of a part of you. An aspect that I should n't forget. Sometimes they're mere presence helps me as the practicalities in life start to fade from my memory. When I spot Demeter sitting in front of the fridge, it hits me that I still need to do the groceries. Oh Lily, I miss you so much. My life has entered the twilight years. Only so much time is left before I will join you. I hope our Lillibeth will take care of my twelve feline companions. She'll be most delighted recognising some aspect of her mother in each of them. Yours forever with endless love, Werner.\n\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about 500 words in length:\nYossarian fakes a liver ailment to stay in the hospital.",

The dawn of a new day, when humans thought to sneak up on the Deep Woods Dragon while it slept. It feared the way the sun reflected off of it' s scales, they said. It' s prismatic hide was so bright it was blinding. If taunted into the sun, they said, the Deep Woods Dragon could be defeated by the least trained of knights. The Deep Woods Dragon needed to be blinded, they said, or it would burn its attackers to ashes with rainbow-hued flames. He knew these rumors because the butterflies had told him. They were drawn to the rainbow of greens, yellows, pinks and purples of his scales, like the flowers they coveted so much. They had told him this, too, but the Dragon did not mind. The butterflies were honest, as their lives were short and beautiful. Even still, they could fly unhindered among the humans, even admired by the small humans who chased them, laughing. They told him stories while they rested on his wingtips, tail, and snout. Butterflies did not fear the Dragon, because they knew the truth. With a yawn, the Dragon shifted its weight to better perch itself on the tree' s stout branch. This tree was taller than the others, and overlooked a small, circular clearing. Without the deer, the weeds thrived, covering the dirt in a green, tangled mass. At the edge of the clearing stood a massive cave entrance, vines draped over the sides of smooth rock. The Dragon had snapped off the vines in front of the entrance, to give the illusion of occupancy. This was, after all, where the humans thought he lived. He knew these rumors because the butterflies had told him. \"In an ancient cave in the middle of the wood, lives an ancient dragon who' s up to no good!\" That was what the small humans like to chant as they chased the butterflies and laughed. So the Dragon tore at the vines, and scared the graceful deer from the peaceful clearing. He had enjoyed watching the deer with their young as they grazed the clearing. From up above in his favorite tree, they could not see him, and they could not fear him. Three times a day, the Dragon glided down from his tree to the old cave' s opening. There, he took a deep breath and screamed as loud as he could. He cried in both low tones and high pitches. He wailed in imitation of female humans, shouted in a voice mimicking angry male humans. The Dragon stood on top of the cave and breathed eye-searing beams of light from his mouth to the sky. It scared the birds huddled in the trees, and the noises scared the deer far from the clearing. But they also scared the humans away from the Deep Woods. He knew these rumors because the butterflies had told him. So he made his noises, made the lights, and scared the humans away. Because any humans who saw the Dragon would discover the truth. Because, when the Dragon stepped into the sunlight, they' d see how small he really was. The Deep Woods Dragon, with prismatic scales that shone in the sun and such a frightening voice, was the size of a domestic house cat. And only the butterflies knew the truth.\n\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about 500 words in length:\nYossarian moves a line on a map to postpone a mission."

Uncle Kevin tried to hide Cousin Kingsley when they realized he could make people disappear. Well, they made Cousin Kingsley disappear. I just came into my powers. Mother just made the most horrible sound, a hoarse, gutteral scream when I brushed by her in the cramped kitchen. She is still writhing on the ground, albeit silent. It seems, that I can cause pain to whomever I touch. I think They might try to make me disappear too. Oh dear.

Father is a genius with technology while mother can heal with just a touch. I turn sixteen in a little less than two hours and I can' t wait to find out what my power is. It was the Law to register your abilities no more than two hours after you receive it. If you don' t, well, if you don' t, you might cease to exist. That was what we have been taught since those carefree days in preschool. They will hunt you down no matter how you try to hide. Uncle Kevin tried to hide Cousin Kingsley when they realized he could make people disappear. Well, they made Cousin Kingsley disappear. I just came into my powers. Mother just made the most horrible sound, a hoarse, gutteral scream when I brushed by her in the cramped kitchen. She is still writhing on the ground, albeit silent. It seems, that I can cause pain to whomever I touch. I think They might try to make me disappear too. Oh dear. She isn' t moving anymore.\n\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about 500 words in length:\nYossarian fails to release his bombs on the first run over Ferrara.",

Several wars, booms in technology so astonishing that soon enough scientists said we were going to be making contact with celestial bodies outside of the solar system, and last of all the introduction of a drug you could take that would change every strand of your DNA.

Contemplating my life as it were. So many memories I wanted to share with you. Diamonds for my one true love. Do you remember that one cool summer evening half a lifetime ago? We nestled ourselves against each other on the blanket in the park. I can still feel your skin against mine as we watched the fireworks together. Your chestnut hair stroking my cheek and ear as you rested your head on my shoulder. I could n't believe you were gone. Day turned into night. Food tasted like nothing. The world turned into a bland grey color. I could n't believe it. I did n't want to believe it. I wept and kept weeping. Then I had no tears left to sob. I lost weight. I lost my hair. I gained wrinkles. When I lost you, the man in the mirror showed me his true age almost overnight. But then things started to change. Our Elisabeth. Our loving, kind Lillibeth who moved half a world for her Australian. She visited me eventually. We talked about you, Lily. We shared a thousand little things between us. A flock of starlings composing your life. During that visit, the turmoil caused by losing you finally seemed to settle. At the end, I decided to finally change my Facebook status. Lillibeth helped me. You know my old, bony fingers have gotten a mind of their own, it seems. I wanted to tell you, Lilly, that I got a little surprise the very next day. This tabby kitten sat outside our garden door the very next morning. It seemed lost, but her eyes betrayed she knew exactly were she was. As I opened the door, she jumped right in and installed herself in the spot on the couch from where you used to watch the telly during long winter evenings. I decided to dub her Lilly because she seems to have a playful streak. Just like you. And most importantly, she seemed to be the antidote to my loneliness. That's not the end of it. Lily was only the first. Each week, I woke up to find two or three feline friends at our garden door. I let them, fed them and started to call them by a name I gave them. Each of them seemingly knowing that she belonged in this house. There's Athena who sits on your sewing machine, looking wise beyond her years. There's Hera who likes to wake me up each morning, and has this stern and down-to-earth disposition. There's Hebe, she's just a kitten who seems to have no bounds teasing the others. All in all, there's twelve of them who came to live with me. They keep me company. Follow me through the house as I go about my day. When I see them, they always remind me of a part of you. An aspect that I should n't forget. Sometimes they're mere presence helps me as the practicalities in life start to fade from my memory. When I spot Demeter sitting in front of the fridge, it hits me that I still need to do the groceries. Oh Lily, I miss you so much. My life has entered the twilight years. Only so much time is left before I will join you. I hope our Lillibeth will take care of my twelve feline companions. She'll be most delighted recognising some aspect of her mother in each of them. Yours forever with endless love, Werner.\n\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about 500 words in length:\nDanny Saunders injures Reuven Malter during a softball game."

Both boys are Jewish and both boys are good students. However, they come from different backgrounds and have different interests. Danny is interested in psychology while Reuven is interested in history. Despite their differences, the two boys become friends after Danny apologizes for injuring Reuven. They spend a lot of time together discussing their studies and sharing their thoughts on various topics. One day, Danny tells Reuven that he wants to study psychology at college. Reuven is surprised because he thought Danny would follow in his father's footsteps and become a rabbi. However, Danny explains that he wants to help people and believes that psychology is the best way to do that. Reuven is impressed by Danny's decision and encourages him to pursue his dreams. The two boys continue to be close friends even after they graduate from high school",

Living in post-war Britain, death was not an uncommon sight. Everyone had at least one firearm to defend themselves, everyone had encountered gunfire in the streets, and everyone knew what it meant to live every day like it could be their last. The revolution that was supposed to end the tyranny of a dictatorship had ripped the country apart; counties had split into factions, all threatening total destruction of the others. In ten years the population was decimated, the country reduced to a crumbling mass of fallen buildings and civilians with guns. All around me was depression, death, dirt, famine. Thinking about it, it's quite hilarious, in such a depressing way. The sacks of bones, flesh and organs we saw everyday were once living, breathing, talking human beings. They had a mother, a father, a pet, a first love, they were educated, they succeeded and they failed. And they died. A single bullet can end so much. That morning, as I wandered to the local shop for some bread, clutching my rifle, my world completely ended. I had no time to react; as soon as I entered Grange Avenue a bullet burrowed into my head, smashing part of my brain, and knocking me straight out cold. I woke in a beautiful wooden chalet, bright natural light streaming through vast windows above the soft, clean bed that I rested in. My itchy, dirty clothes were replaced with beautiful white robes, soft as silk and cleaner than anything I had ever seen. I sat up, and looked around the room - it was furnished luxuriously, with beautiful gold-leaf chairs and fantastic bright works of art hanging around the room. I got up and left the room, and immediately my breath was forced from me. The crumbled grey streets of London had gone. In their place were beautiful old chalets, bright white skyscrapers, and marble streets. I could also see a very unfamiliar sight - a beautiful emerald park, littered with tall, radiant trees, ferns, and glowing coloured flowers. Clear water ran through them. All around the streets were people dressed similar to me, smiling and talking and laughing. The smog-ridden sky had been replaced with a beautiful, deep purple, but the world was light around me and the I could see the vast orange sun dipping behind the structures around the city.

I was designated'historian' by my job title but that did n't mean anything. In reality I was just someone to make sure the systems did n't crash when multiple upgrades were scheduled. During a routine check on the upgrade status in the memory networks I noticed an error warning flagged for the autodiagnostic. The systems would be incapacitated for another few hours and the boredom of being the useless organic element had gotten to me. Using a personal input I synced to the memory's records. It took all of five minutes to realize that an entire year was missing. Figuring it was a location error I waited for the systems to restore. My AI-Component woke up as the rest of the systems came back to function. There was the familiar sense of its presence. There was my desync-anxiety being washed away by that presence. I spoke allowed the question: Where is 2016? As I asked the answer flickered immediately into my awareness. 2016 was nowhere because no such year had ever taken place. All recorded human history is fabricated. In order to save information space only certain years exist as detailed records whilst most have only notable events. Some years have been allocated as empty. These years remain empty until such time as narrative cohesion requires the retconning of significant historical details to explain novel episodic situational representations.

I knew that the city outside the Archive and the Archive itself were situational representations. I knew that the year was 12 and that no evidence of organic intelligence had ever been discovered. There was nothing on Earth remotely resembling human beings. I was just the system representing some part of itself to itself in the most efficient way it knew how. Despite they're non-existence the anxiolytics had the desired effect and soon the memory purge would expunge any recollection of remembering the truth.

Before genes started mutating, before people received powers, before the world as he knew it ended. Things are different in the Today. We learnt it all during history in school. Mr T. brought us back to the Before and we had watched the wars, the starvation, the shootings, the massacres. Every child Today knows the story, because as some wise man in the Before had said, those who can not learn from history, are doomed to repeat it. And we don' t want that. We are lucky that the wars have ended as quickly as they begun. The Normals, like my grandfather, who were trying to kill those with powers were quickly put down by us. When my second cousin Sophia received her ability to bend the wills of others, grandfather had been most displeased. After all, it was one of the powers most feared back in the Before. Those with this ability were the ones who dominated and the wars had come. Countries fighting for dominance, millionaires waking up to find that they have signed away their fortune, men and women everywhere woke up to find that they have been doing things that they never would. It was then when the true Wars begun. Things are better Today though, people like Sophia are being kept safe. I haven' t seen her since she registered her powers two hours after she turned sixteen. Joshua, my older brother, had the ability to turn into a guinea pig. Grandfather was highly amused. It seemed though, that abilities are not hereditary. Father is a genius with technology while mother can heal with just a touch. I turn sixteen in a little less than two hours and I can' t wait to find out what my power is. It was the Law to register your abilities no more than two hours after you receive it. If you don' t, well, if you don' t, you might cease to exist. That was what we have been taught since those carefree days in preschool. They will hunt you down no matter how you try to hide. Uncle Kevin tried to hide Cousin Kingsley when they realized he could make people disappear. Well, they made Cousin Kingsley disappear. I just came into my powers. Mother just made the most horrible sound, a hoarse, gutteral scream when I brushed by her in the cramped kitchen. She is still writhing on the ground, albeit silent. It seems, that I can cause pain to whomever I touch. I think They might try to make me disappear too. Oh dear. She isn' t moving anymore.\n\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about 500 words in length:\nAlfred Brooks lives with his Aunt Pearl in Harlem."

When my second cousin Sophia received her ability to bend the wills of others, grandfather had been most displeased. After all, it was one of the powers most feared back in the Before. Those with this ability were the ones who dominated and the wars had come. Countries fighting for dominance, millionaires waking up to find that they have signed away their fortune, men and women everywhere woke up to find that they have been doing things that they never would. It was then when the true Wars begun. Things are better Today though, people like Sophia are being kept safe. I haven' t seen her since she registered her powers two hours after she turned sixteen. Joshua, my older brother, had the ability to turn into a guinea pig. Grandfather was highly amused. It seemed though, that abilities are not hereditary. Father is a genius with technology while mother can heal with just a touch. I turn sixteen in a little less than two hours and I can' t wait to find out what my power is. It was the Law to register your abilities no more than two hours after you receive it. If you don' t, well, if you don' t, you might cease to exist. That was what we have been taught since those carefree days in preschool. They will hunt you down no matter how you try to hide. Uncle Kevin tried to hide Cousin Kingsley when they realized he could make people disappear. Well, they made Cousin Kingsley disappear. I just came into my powers. Mother just made the most horrible sound, a hoarse, gutteral scream when I brushed by her in the cramped kitchen. She is still writhing on the ground, albeit silent. It seems, that I can cause pain to whomever I touch. I think They might try to make me disappear too. Oh dear. She isn' t moving anymore.\n\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about 500 words in length:\nAlfred Brooks lives with his Aunt Pearl in Harlem.",
        "output": " He has always wanted to go to college but his aunt doesn't believe in education. She thinks that Alfred should stay home and help her run the house. One day, Alfred decides to take matters into his own hands. He sneaks out of the house and goes to the library. There, he meets a librarian named Mrs. Smith. She helps him get a library card and shows him how to use the computers. With Mrs. Smith's help, Alfred starts taking online classes at night. He also begins working part-time at a local bookstore. Soon, Alfred is able to save enough money to pay for tuition at a nearby community college. His aunt is furious when she finds out what he has done, but she eventually comes around and supports him. Thanks to Mrs. Smith and the other librarians at the library, Alfred is now on track to achieve his dream of going to college.\n\n",

The office towers lighting up in the evening haze and the smeary pale of a cloudless sunset. The tiny headlights of cars with sweaty passengers unseen, idling in traffic, smelling the hot food cooking in restaurants. The world shifts as the woman behind the camera adjusts her footing, muttering in English to her boyfriend. A light like the sun over the horizon, there and then gone. Silence, but for the wind in the trees. She asks what that was. The clean, shaved, washed, waxed people in suits at desks read facts and information like sports commentary. They narrate animations with moving arrows and lines like football plays. They report on characters and captains. They discuss. They debate. They nod solemnly. The light flashes in the sky and fades but the afterglow remains. They update, they check-in, they go-live, they re-Tweet. Wounded civilians scream and coddle loved ones, rewind. Look right here: loved ones die. Rewind. The light like the sun. Stay tuned. A city, its mountains. The office buildings lighting up in evening haze. Tiny headlights and unseen drivers thinking about food. A mutter in the sunset. A light and its afterglow. The wind in the trees. The troops are bad cameramen. They laugh or they scream or they joke nervously. Trucks and tanks and armoured vehicles on tall tires carry them down empty roads where sometimes cars have been abandoned or craters from bad arty shots force detours. The videos capture the sounds of war. Pops and crackles of overhead bullets. The shake and snapping of stalks and branches. Rivers idling over rounded stones. The scritchety clatter of the camera tumbling after bomb concussion shreds the canopies and dust swirls in mottled sunlight. Winged insects flashing momentarily in their arcs. A city, its mountains. Buildings, drivers. Sunset. A light. People speak in hushed tones. Somewhere, over the horizon on the other side of the world, everything has changed. There are no videos of the darkness that came afterward. A light like the sun. A motorcyclist pulls over to the side of the road in the clear, humid evening and reaches down to turn the petcock to OFF before quieting the motor. She's out in the country, flat fields of corn and wheat on either side of the old road. Above her the stars are out and bright in the sky. One of them, brighter than the rest, moves slowly toward the Earth's penumbra. The rider flips up her visor and sits back, hands behind her on the seat, watching the little light move, thinking of the people inside looking back. When those astronauts look down at Seoul, what do they see? The light fades and she is left alone. She listens and hears only crickets and a soft waxy rustle of a breeze in the corn. No guns, no artillery. No marching. No wet gasps from ruined faces. She shifts and works a hand into her pocket, pulling out a phone made in South Korea. She wonders if the people who screwed and soldered its pieces together are still alive, whether they could have seen the flash from wherever they were. Her friend has texted her, asking when she will get to the party. She responds with \"A few minutes\" and puts the phone away. The bike starts up fine once it's warm and after a moment of further staring into the stars she kicks the engine over and rolls away. The bright red of her tail light flashes as she slows at the intersection, then winks out.\n\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about 500 words in length:\nJames is arrested and put on probation after the burglary."

And if I squinted, I saw the mountain ranges, the seas, the islands, all humanity's residence. And yet, something was wrong. I did n't see the round sphere I expected to see.

We take it as a personal insult to our intelligence if we're wrong, thinking'we should've known.\" Thinking we're right is more important than being right. But I am a logical, rational human being. I ca n't let my emotions overcome me. Knowing the truth is infinitely more important than being right. And yet I find myself so hesitant to admit the mistakes of my predecessors. To admit that we will have to re-learn everything about the Earth. To admit that we will have to start again. To admit that humans are mere mortals. The thing about facts is that they're true whether you believe in them or not. But I can change that. I grabbed my lighter and lit the photos. I watched them burn up until they had turned into ash.

I was essentially immortal before that moment in time. I was the best comedian in the world, and apparently better than anyone in the afterlife as well. It was the only reason the Grim Reaper decided not to take me. I could make him laugh, and in his line of work that was a rarity. I do n't even remember what it was that I had said when he showed up at my car accident. I can recall him bending down next to my overturned Honda civic and reaching in to pull me out. I made some off the wall comment and he froze, dead in his tracks. It was the weirdest laugh I had ever heard, but one I appreciated more than all of the others combined. He let me live, provided that every year on the anniversary of what should have been my death, I would tell him a joke that would make him cry with laughter. I was his own personal jester, and for that he rewarded me handsomely. And then on that fateful day, 121 years later, I muttered those stupid words that seized our contract and ripped it in two. Who knew Death would be so self conscious about his smell? And to make things worse, that was n't even the joke that I was going to tell him! The actual joke was a masterpiece, but he would n't give me the chance to tell it. I ran out of that room faster than I'd ever run before. And I've been running ever since. I think the reason that he has n't taken me yet is because of our long history together. That is n't to say that he's forgiven me. He seems to enjoy reminding me that he's near. Everyone I get close to dies without reason. I'll see a dog in the park that I think looks adorable and before I can pet it, it'll fall over dead. Roses crumble before I can enjoy their scent and food rots on my fork before I can bring it to my mouth. He's killing everything around me. I have discovered that Death is a jester of a different sort. I had provided him with a form of humor that he was n't used to, but he has since grown tired of it, and reverted to his old ways. Now, he once again deals in jokes of cruelty and irony. In a way, I am still fulfilling my part of our old deal. The Reaper still laughs, and he still laughs at me. Only now, the difference is I'm not laughing.\n\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about 500 words in length:\nAbsalom is arrested for the murder of Arthur Jarvis, a white activist."

I was essentially immortal before that moment in time. I was the best comedian in the world, and apparently better than anyone in the afterlife as well. It was the only reason the Grim Reaper decided not to take me. I could make him laugh, and in his line of work that was a rarity. I do n't even remember what it was that I had said when he showed up at my car accident. I can recall him bending down next to my overturned Honda civic and reaching in to pull me out. I made some off the wall comment and he froze, dead in his tracks. It was the weirdest laugh I had ever heard, but one I appreciated more than all of the others combined. He let me live, provided that every year on the anniversary of what should have been my death, I would tell him a joke that would make him cry with laughter. I was his own personal jester, and for that he rewarded me handsomely. And then on that fateful day, 121 years later, I muttered those stupid words that seized our contract and ripped it in two. Who knew Death would be so self conscious about his smell? And to make things worse, that was n't even the joke that I was going to tell him! The actual joke was a masterpiece, but he would n't give me the chance to tell it. I ran out of that room faster than I'd ever run before. And I've been running ever since. I think the reason that he has n't taken me yet is because of our long history together. That is n't to say that he's forgiven me. He seems to enjoy reminding me that he's near. Everyone I get close to dies without reason. I'll see a dog in the park that I think looks adorable and before I can pet it, it'll fall over dead. Roses crumble before I can enjoy their scent and food rots on my fork before I can bring it to my mouth. He's killing everything around me. I have discovered that Death is a jester of a different sort. I had provided him with a form of humor that he was n't used to, but he has since grown tired of it, and reverted to his old ways. Now, he once again deals in jokes of cruelty and irony. In a way, I am still fulfilling my part of our old deal. The Reaper still laughs, and he still laughs at me. Only now, the difference is I'm not laughing.\n\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about 500 words in length:\nAbsalom is arrested for the murder of Arthur Jarvis, a white activist.",
        "output": " Absalom is a black man who works as a gardener for Mr. Jarvis. When the police arrive at the scene, they find Absalom standing over the body of Mr. Jarvis with a bloody knife in his hand. Absalom claims that he found the knife in the garden shed and that he was just trying to protect himself when Mr. Jarvis attacked him. However, the police are not convinced by his story and arrest him for murder.\n\nThe trial begins and Absalom is represented by a young lawyer named Thomas Morel. Morel is determined to prove Absalom's innocence and does everything in his power to discredit the prosecution's case. He calls witnesses who testify that Absalom was seen in the area where the crime took place shortly before the murder occurred. He also presents evidence that suggests that someone else may have committed the crime.\n\nDespite Morel's efforts, the jury finds Absalom guilty of murder and sentences him to death. Morel appeals the verdict, but the appeal is denied.",

It' s prismatic hide was so bright it was blinding. If taunted into the sun, they said, the Deep Woods Dragon could be defeated by the least trained of knights. The Deep Woods Dragon needed to be blinded, they said, or it would burn its attackers to ashes with rainbow-hued flames. He knew these rumors because the butterflies had told him. They were drawn to the rainbow of greens, yellows, pinks and purples of his scales, like the flowers they coveted so much. They had told him this, too, but the Dragon did not mind. The butterflies were honest, as their lives were short and beautiful. Even still, they could fly unhindered among the humans, even admired by the small humans who chased them, laughing. They told him stories while they rested on his wingtips, tail, and snout. Butterflies did not fear the Dragon, because they knew the truth. With a yawn, the Dragon shifted its weight to better perch itself on the tree' s stout branch. This tree was taller than the others, and overlooked a small, circular clearing. Without the deer, the weeds thrived, covering the dirt in a green, tangled mass. At the edge of the clearing stood a massive cave entrance, vines draped over the sides of smooth rock. The Dragon had snapped off the vines in front of the entrance, to give the illusion of occupancy. This was, after all, where the humans thought he lived. He knew these rumors because the butterflies had told him. \"In an ancient cave in the middle of the wood, lives an ancient dragon who' s up to no good!\" That was what the small humans like to chant as they chased the butterflies and laughed. So the Dragon tore at the vines, and scared the graceful deer from the peaceful clearing. He had enjoyed watching the deer with their young as they grazed the clearing. From up above in his favorite tree, they could not see him, and they could not fear him. Three times a day, the Dragon glided down from his tree to the old cave' s opening. There, he took a deep breath and screamed as loud as he could. He cried in both low tones and high pitches. He wailed in imitation of female humans, shouted in a voice mimicking angry male humans. The Dragon stood on top of the cave and breathed eye-searing beams of light from his mouth to the sky. It scared the birds huddled in the trees, and the noises scared the deer far from the clearing. But they also scared the humans away from the Deep Woods. He knew these rumors because the butterflies had told him. So he made his noises, made the lights, and scared the humans away. Because any humans who saw the Dragon would discover the truth. Because, when the Dragon stepped into the sunlight, they' d see how small he really was.

When he arrives, he finds Eve sitting on the couch, wearing a black dress and smoking a cigarette. She asks him if he wants to watch a movie, and he says yes. They sit together on the couch and watch a film called \"The Lady Vanishes.\" As they watch the movie, Eve tells Tod about her life in Hollywood. She talks about how she started out as a child star and then moved on to adult roles. She also talks about how difficult it can be to find work in Hollywood, especially for women.

She tells him she needs help with her lines and asks if he would like to read with her. Tod agrees and they spend hours rehearsing scenes from classic films. As their friendship grows, Tod starts to notice that Sarah is becoming more and more obsessed with fame. She talks constantly about how she wants to be a star and how she'll do whatever it takes to get there. Tod tries to talk her out of it, but she doesn't listen. One night, after a particularly intense rehearsal session, Sarah confesses that she's been taking drugs to help her stay awake during rehearsals. She says she knows it's wrong, but she can't stop herself. Tod is horrified and tells her she needs help. But Sarah just laughs and says she doesn't need anyone's help.

And after several decades more immortal humans were everywhere, but humanity could n't discover how to replicate the genes or mutations causing the phenomena. It's now over one hundred fifty years since the birth of the first immortal. A young looking girl named Esther sat in a grassy field. Trees skirted the field at her back and in front of her sat a city. She'd seen more in her lifetime than any other human ever had. Several wars, booms in technology so astonishing that soon enough scientists said we were going to be making contact with celestial bodies outside of the solar system, and last of all the introduction of a drug you could take that would change every strand of your DNA. The age at which you took it would be the age you appeared to be for the rest of your life. She had a passion for spreading her gift around so others would n't experience the burdens and pains of aging. But the side effects of the drug did n't manifest for years, sometimes decades.

The population of true immortals was still growing and the population of the population of mortals and mortal turned immortals remained about the same. Groups of mortals rose up trying to keep their way of life going, but many wished for them to give up so humanity could be purified of death. Was it cruel to bring a mortal to life in the world of immortals? Immortals ruled the world and they certainly thought so. After the discovery that the drug had severe negative side effects the immortals wished to ban it as well, and so they did. It was illegal to produce it, sell it, possess it, and above all, illegal to have a child after having taken the drug. Esther had left her lab years early. She had given up on finding why they could n't fix the drug or reverse its effects. She moved out to the country, wishing she had never discovered it. The country was an expensive place to live due to the enormous population size humanity had reached, but she had more money than she would ever need. She walked towards a giant tree in the middle of the field. It was one that had been planted when she was young, it gave her comfort to be with something as old as she was.

I watched David from the day he entered the Earth, and never before had I seen someone as special as him. He always thought of others first, always trying to help others before even contemplating his own commodities. I approached him on the fateful day at exactly noon. He was old now, no longer in his prime as he was finally about to lose his battle with cancer. I approached him as the hourglass emptied completely to the bottom. I spoke to him,\" David you must know who I am at this hour.\" He answered not necessarily speaking to me,\" If only I had helped more.... If only I could have have had more time! How dreadful to go when so many more need help!\" At this moment I found it immensely hard to fulfill my task. I was not met with a man begging for more time only to waste it on fruitless trivialities. I was met with a man who wanted to bring grace to more people. He wished not to make his life better, but only cares to try to improve as many others as possible. I finally brought myself to say,\" David you have been a good man, but death is one thing which is inevitable, and not even I can grant time when someone is due. You must come along now with me.\" He allowed his soul to leave his body, a tear running down his face as he did. I extended my arm to him and he obliged. If there is one final peace to the journey is the experience of seeing one's life pass by as I guide them to the next step. I saw, as we walked, countless people who David had helped, most of which he had n't known and would never see again. Every part of me wished to guide him back to his body, but I knew I had a task to fulfill, and I knew I had to complete it. After a long while of walking down the path, we finally came to the gateway where David would continue without my guidance. I never know where the person will go once they enter, but I knew David would go to a place that would have the same passion in death as he did in life. I never had such a hard time seeing someone move on, and I sat a while thinking of how tragic it is for someone like David, genuinely the best kind of person, to be taken from such a cruel world when he one of the few people who deserved to stay.

One night, after a particularly painful rejection, Tod decides to take matters into his own hands. He sneaks into Faye's house and steals her diary. Inside, he finds out that Faye has been keeping a secret from everyone: she is actually a vampire. This revelation changes everything for Tod. Suddenly, he sees Faye in a new light. He realizes that she is not just a beautiful woman; she is also a powerful creature of the night. Tod decides to become a vampire himself, so that he can be with Faye forever. He goes to a local cemetery and drinks the blood of a freshly buried corpse. The transformation is painful, but worth it. When he wakes up, he is a vampire. He goes to find Faye and tells her what he has done. She is shocked, but happy. They kiss passionately, and then",

At one mission, Latour meets a young girl named Maria who is orphaned after her family dies from smallpox. She becomes Latour's servant and travels with him to Santa Fe. Along the way, they encounter a group of Apache warriors who attack them. Latour manages to escape with Maria, but she is injured in the process. They continue their journey to Santa Fe, where Latour finds work as a priest. He takes Maria under his wing and teaches her about Christianity. Over time, she grows close to Latour and develops feelings for him. However, she knows that he is married and cannot act on these feelings. One day, while Latour is away on a trip, Maria falls ill. She dies shortly thereafter, leaving behind a broken-hearted Latour. He buries her near the mission where they first met, and vows to never love again.\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about",

Vaillant is older, wiser, and more experienced. Together, they form a formidable team.\n\nThey arrive at their new parish, and immediately set to work. They clean up the church, paint it, and decorate it. They hold services every day, and preach passionately about the importance of faith. They reach out to the community, and soon have a thriving congregation.\n\nBut there is one problem: the local bishop does not approve of their methods. He believes that the church should be a place of quiet contemplation, not a bustling hub of activity. He orders them to tone down their preaching, and to stop reaching out to the community.\n\nLatour and Vaillant refuse to comply. They continue to preach passionately, and to reach out to the community. The bishop becomes increasingly frustrated, and eventually excommunicates them",

The office towers lighting up in the evening haze and the smeary pale of a cloudless sunset. The tiny headlights of cars with sweaty passengers unseen, idling in traffic, smelling the hot food cooking in restaurants. The world shifts as the woman behind the camera adjusts her footing, muttering in English to her boyfriend. A light like the sun over the horizon, there and then gone. Silence, but for the wind in the trees. She asks what that was. The clean, shaved, washed, waxed people in suits at desks read facts and information like sports commentary. They narrate animations with moving arrows and lines like football plays. They report on characters and captains. They discuss. They debate. They nod solemnly. The light flashes in the sky and fades but the afterglow remains. They update, they check-in, they go-live, they re-Tweet. Wounded civilians scream and coddle loved ones, rewind. Look right here: loved ones die. Rewind. The light like the sun. Stay tuned. A city, its mountains. The office buildings lighting up in evening haze. Tiny headlights and unseen drivers thinking about food. A mutter in the sunset. A light and its afterglow. The wind in the trees. The troops are bad cameramen. They laugh or they scream or they joke nervously. Trucks and tanks and armoured vehicles on tall tires carry them down empty roads where sometimes cars have been abandoned or craters from bad arty shots force detours. The videos capture the sounds of war. Pops and crackles of overhead bullets. The shake and snapping of stalks and branches. Rivers idling over rounded stones. The scritchety clatter of the camera tumbling after bomb concussion shreds the canopies and dust swirls in mottled sunlight. Winged insects flashing momentarily in their arcs. A city, its mountains. Buildings, drivers. Sunset. A light. People speak in hushed tones. Somewhere, over the horizon on the other side of the world, everything has changed. There are no videos of the darkness that came afterward. A light like the sun. A motorcyclist pulls over to the side of the road in the clear, humid evening and reaches down to turn the petcock to OFF before quieting the motor. She's out in the country, flat fields of corn and wheat on either side of the old road. Above her the stars are out and bright in the sky. One of them, brighter than the rest, moves slowly toward the Earth's penumbra. The rider flips up her visor and sits back, hands behind her on the seat, watching the little light move, thinking of the people inside looking back. When those astronauts look down at Seoul, what do they see? The light fades and she is left alone. She listens and hears only crickets and a soft waxy rustle of a breeze in the corn. No guns, no artillery. No marching. No wet gasps from ruined faces. She shifts and works a hand into her pocket, pulling out a phone made in South Korea. She wonders if the people who screwed and soldered its pieces together are still alive, whether they could have seen the flash from wherever they were. Her friend has texted her, asking when she will get to the party. She responds with \"A few minutes\" and puts the phone away. The bike starts up fine once it's warm and after a moment of further staring into the stars she kicks the engine over and rolls away. The bright red of her tail light flashes as she slows at the intersection, then winks out.\n\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about 500 words in length:\nLatour meets resistance from local priests in New Mexico."

There was plenty of time beneath the lukewarm stream of water to contemplate the sadness of another hangover caused by drinking alone. It'd been weeks since I last had a chance to talk to another human, instead of just the PC terminal supplied by work. I towelled off and staggered through to the living-room and slumped in front of the computer, waiting for the piercing whistle to repeat, to emanate from my phone. The second alarm marked that it was time for the Remembrance. I sigh, move the empty beer bottles away from my desk and load up Hitchens 2. Since the Bliss neurovirus was released, there was a killing to be made from this sort of software; software designed to take you through a basic test, activating every faculty you'd conceivably need to prevent the atrophy. First, colour recognition and geometric shapes. Second, basic maths ramping into some gentle algebra and trigonometry. English, ethics, road safety, compassion testing, aesthetics, philosophical contemplation, the sciences. It was a hard sell at the beginning, for companies to give their employees the few hours off each morning they needed for the state-mandated testing, but given the choice between late employees and those in conscious comas, they made the right choice. Two hours later, the general test finishes. I flick through my results, 91 % recognition of the basic concepts, not too bad after a night of hard drinking. Next would come a quick half hour personal session: the names of loved ones, relations to family members, anniversaries and birthdays. A prompt flashes on the screen: \"Please enter your identity number and full name\". I rattle my digits in, 12958321-A, and tab down to the field for my name. I blank. Slight panic begins to grow as I search my beer-soaked consciousness for that basic, bloody basic, detail. It'd been too long since I last had to introduce myself with anything other than my work ID number, too long since I had any reason to say those damned words out loud. Darren? No. Christopher? No, definitely not. I shout and swear and blaspheme out loud, as I slowly feel the neurovirus go to work; Purgatory, we call it, a limbo without knowledge, tied with a purging. It dissolves me gently. The panic subsides. I stare blankly at the flashing cursor, waiting for me to enter some detail or another.

The exposition is held on the shores of Lake Michigan in Jackson Park. The park is located on the south side of Chicago. The exposition is built around a central lagoon. The lagoon is surrounded by buildings representing different countries. The United States building is the largest building at the fair. It is shaped like a cross. The building has three wings. Each wing represents one of the three branches of government. The north wing represents the legislative branch. The east wing represents the executive branch. The west wing represents the judicial branch. The building also contains a large rotunda. The rotunda is decorated with murals depicting scenes from American history. The fair opens on May 1st.

A large concrete wall surrounded the plaza, a thousand V masks for each revolutionary lost in the fighting so far. You'd mistake Lower Manhattan for Mogadishu if it were n't for the skyscrapers that watched over the fighting. The compound for the Occupy movement was never quiet, the rattle of gunfire or the occasional pained yell as another fighter was brought back from the frontlines. The fighting had become entrenched by the 5th year. For every advance made on Central Park, there were another 50 casualties.

A large concrete wall surrounded the plaza, a thousand V masks for each revolutionary lost in the fighting so far. You'd mistake Lower Manhattan for Mogadishu if it were n't for the skyscrapers that watched over the fighting. The compound for the Occupy movement was never quiet, the rattle of gunfire or the occasional pained yell as another fighter was brought back from the frontlines. The fighting had become entrenched by the 5th year. For every advance made on Central Park, there were another 50 casualties.

The fair's success leads to the construction of similar expositions around the world, including the Paris Exposition Universelle (1900) and the Panama-Pacific International Exposition (1915). The Chicago World's Fair also inspires the creation of the Field Museum of Natural History, the Shedd Aquarium, and the Adler Planetarium.\n\nThe fair's legacy lives on in the form of the Museum of Science and Industry, the Art Institute of Chicago, and the University of Chicago. The fair's impact can also be seen in the development of modern architecture, urban planning, and transportation systems. The fair's influence can even be felt in popular culture, with references to the fair appearing in movies, television shows, and books.\n\nIn conclusion, the Chicago World's Fair of",

Montag thinks she is weird because she does not care about what other people think of her. She is very curious and wants to know everything there is to know about the world. She asks Montag questions about his job as a fireman and why he burns books. Montag tells her that he does not really understand why he does it either. They become friends and spend a lot of time together talking and reading books. One day they go to the library where they find out that all the books have been burned. They decide to start their own secret library so they can keep the knowledge alive. They meet up with other people who share their passion for learning and they form a group called the Underground Library. Together they work hard to preserve the knowledge that has been lost over time. They realize that knowledge is power",

Never once had experienced trouble in my task as I had even had to pluck sweet children from the arms of their mothers. However, it all changed when I was tasked with taking the soul of David Mckiny. I watched David from the day he entered the Earth, and never before had I seen someone as special as him. He always thought of others first, always trying to help others before even contemplating his own commodities. I approached him on the fateful day at exactly noon. He was old now, no longer in his prime as he was finally about to lose his battle with cancer. I approached him as the hourglass emptied completely to the bottom. I spoke to him,\" David you must know who I am at this hour.\" He answered not necessarily speaking to me,\" If only I had helped more.... If only I could have have had more time! How dreadful to go when so many more need help!\" At this moment I found it immensely hard to fulfill my task. I was not met with a man begging for more time only to waste it on fruitless trivialities. I was met with a man who wanted to bring grace to more people. He wished not to make his life better, but only cares to try to improve as many others as possible. I finally brought myself to say,\" David you have been a good man, but death is one thing which is inevitable, and not even I can grant time when someone is due. You must come along now with me.\" He allowed his soul to leave his body, a tear running down his face as he did. I extended my arm to him and he obliged. If there is one final peace to the journey is the experience of seeing one's life pass by as I guide them to the next step. I saw, as we walked, countless people who David had helped, most of which he had n't known and would never see again. Every part of me wished to guide him back to his body, but I knew I had a task to fulfill, and I knew I had to complete it. After a long while of walking down the path, we finally came to the gateway where David would continue without my guidance. I never know where the person will go once they enter, but I knew David would go to a place that would have the same passion in death as he did in life. I never had such a hard time seeing someone move on, and I sat a while thinking of how tragic it is for someone like David, genuinely the best kind of person, to be taken from such a cruel world when he one of the few people who deserved to stay.

First, colour recognition and geometric shapes. Second, basic maths ramping into some gentle algebra and trigonometry. English, ethics, road safety, compassion testing, aesthetics, philosophical contemplation, the sciences. It was a hard sell at the beginning, for companies to give their employees the few hours off each morning they needed for the state-mandated testing, but given the choice between late employees and those in conscious comas, they made the right choice. Two hours later, the general test finishes. I flick through my results, 91 % recognition of the basic concepts, not too bad after a night of hard drinking. Next would come a quick half hour personal session: the names of loved ones, relations to family members, anniversaries and birthdays. A prompt flashes on the screen: \"Please enter your identity number and full name\". I rattle my digits in, 12958321-A, and tab down to the field for my name. I blank. Slight panic begins to grow as I search my beer-soaked consciousness for that basic, bloody basic, detail. It'd been too long since I last had to introduce myself with anything other than my work ID number, too long since I had any reason to say those damned words out loud. Darren? No. Christopher? No, definitely not. I shout and swear and blaspheme out loud, as I slowly feel the neurovirus go to work; Purgatory, we call it, a limbo without knowledge, tied with a purging. It dissolves me gently. The panic subsides. I stare blankly at the flashing cursor, waiting for me to enter some detail or another. I'm not sure what it's asking for, but I'm sure it's not too important or I'd remember it. I sit there, staring. Just staring.

Perhaps he felt indebted to me since I would have been the master of the house and heir to the family fortunes should things have gone differently. Alas, I had been very young when the harsh disease of Rot Lung had ravaged my body. The disease that could kill full grown men had me lying in bed for months, coughing up blood and yellow phlegm. When the disease finally left my body it left it weak, my lungs wheezed with every breathe and my muscles were left thin and atrophied. If I was from a less affluent family I may have been left to die. Luckily for me, my family was not about to let their firstborn son die. They would also not allow me to show the family as weak, so I was locked away. My brother tells me that he fought for years to keep me as the heir to the family. He said that he argued until he was blue in the face that the Dracul blood was strong and that I would eventually recover. \"Just give him time\", he said, I would be able to take over the duties of master of the house given time. Sometimes I would show improvement, my family rejoiced and my dear brother returned from his travels abroad to help nurse me back to health once again. Unhappily my health never stayed long after the celebrations began. It was as if the mere presence of such joyful happiness poisoned my body. I would began to vomit and become bedridden again for cause of muscle spasms. Through this all my brother would nurse me, spoon feeding me his exotic medicines that he had collected on his travels late into the the night. Always hoping that one of them would finally cure me. Eventually my father had his way, my brother was to be the new head of the family. All of the Dracul land, titles, and riches were to go to him. My loving brother said that he begged father to wait just a little longer, to leave me some small smidgen of inheritance, but it was to no avail. My father died soon after naming my brother heir, before I was ever able to reconcile myself with him. With my father's death, Vladimir moved back home and began his duties as the head of house Dracul fully. Today I awoke feeling better than I had in a very long time. Perhaps I would leave my room and surprise Vlad with how my health, would n't he be so happy? I had not been into the upper chambers since my father had been alive and I had been being groomed for eventual lordship of our house but I still remembered the way, I still remembered the correct way to unlock the siege door. A door intended to seal away an entire wing of the castle. Should the worst happen and the castle be invaded the siege door had the ability to lock and steal away the lord of the house, preserving our family's history and the life of anyone behind it long enough for help to arrive.

This is done under the guise of national security, but really it is because of racism and xenophobia. The government claims that they need to protect themselves from potential spies and saboteurs, but there is no evidence to support these claims. In reality, the government is using this as an excuse to discriminate against Japanese Americans and take away their rights.

Life had always been that way. In primary school she related better to adults than her classmates. In secondary school she was respectful of her teachers but felt she understood the lessons they taught to a deeper level than even they appreciated. University had been much the same except the distance between herself and her professors had turned her conscientious respect into a degree of begrudging disdain. She was certainly more intelligent than anyone she knew of, more so than anyone she had ever met. She picked apart the documents piled high on her desk recalling even the articles in the citations that she had previously read. Today her eyes were heavy, mostly with boredom, somewhat with the strain. Her mind was as sharp as it had ever been but her body showed the signs that she would not be considered a young woman for much longer.

When I look at someone, I see into their future but I only get to see the worst part. Particularly their deaths, I see them in gruesome detail. I've seen car crashes, murders, stabbings and once, I even saw someone who would later die in a plane crash. I was n't always cursed this way, it all started after I was in a nearly fatal car crash, I woke up from a short coma and I could see the deaths of everyone around me. The doctors simply chalked it down to ptsd and gave me meds but I knew it was more that mere ptsd. I knew what I was seeing was n't just imagination. I even found a few people who were to die in a few days time and followed them up to see if they did and they did. All this time, I had not seen my own face in the mirror. I mean, I had seen it but half of it was still covered in bandages, still recovering from my injuries. Something I noticed about my death vision was that it only worked if I could see the entire face of the person. I could n't see the deaths of people who had their faces covered. This is why I figured, I could n't see mine yet and I was determined to keep it that way. I did n't wan na know how I died, I mean would you? Would you want to see how you died in gruesome detail? Of course not! After the bandages came off, I was very careful not to look at my complete reflection. Anytime I wanted to set my hair, I would tie a kerchief around my face. When I brushed my teeth, I wore a bandana, Shades and a scarf for good measure. The temptation to just look at my face in its entirety was hard to overcome but I did. I was traumatised enough by the deaths of others as it is. Shortly after the accident, I moved out of town into a sleepy little village and lived on my own. The fewer the people, the better for me. I lived in a tiny cottage with no reflective surfaces save for the tiny mirror in my bathroom that I kept covered by a cloth most of the time. This morning, I was brushing my teeth as usual and just as I was finishing, my bandana came lose and dropped into the sink. In my desperation to catch it, I undid the scarf and lo! I was staring at my naked face in the mirror. The world went black and I saw myself standing in complete darkness. Suddenly, a look of consternation came over me and I covered behind something. Shortly after a dark figure entered the place and after a short struggle, stabbed me. As I came out of my nightmarish reverie, gasping for breath after seeing myself die. I heard a loud crash in the house, suddenly the power went out. A look of consternation came over my face as I covered behind the bathroom door.\n\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about 500 words in length:\nCharlie Gordon undergoes surgery to increase his intelligence."

Another day of studying droned on. It wasn' t that the material was a challenge, Naif had no problem absorbing every concept she came across and she had more degrees than anyone her age to prove it. Life had always been that way. In primary school she related better to adults than her classmates. In secondary school she was respectful of her teachers but felt she understood the lessons they taught to a deeper level than even they appreciated. University had been much the same except the distance between herself and her professors had turned her conscientious respect into a degree of begrudging disdain. She was certainly more intelligent than anyone she knew of, more so than anyone she had ever met. She picked apart the documents piled high on her desk recalling even the articles in the citations that she had previously read. Today her eyes were heavy, mostly with boredom, somewhat with the strain. Her mind was as sharp as it had ever been but her body showed the signs that she would not be considered a young woman for much longer. Through the closed windows she could vaguely hear the muffled hum of the world rushing by outside. Suddenly the monotony of the day fell away as it was unbound by a sharp thud against the outer wall of her office. Naif quickly straightened her hunched shoulders and bumped the table sloshing coffee over her meticulously curated stacks of research papers. She snarled impatiently at the mess and sprang to the window. She squinted through the blinds at the sunlit scene then furrowed them even further in annoyance. The neighbours were playing baseball with their kids again. Idiots. Hadn' t they any respect for others? One of the little morons ran up to the edge of Naif's apartment, beneath her field of view, and tried to throw the ball back. It careened off course and the cretin had to go pick it up again to return it to his waiting family. Naif rolled her eyes as she turned away from the display of incompetence and inefficiency that played out beyond her walls. As she sopped up the spilled coffee from her desk she mumbled to herself, as she had before, \"I wish everyone were more intelligent. I would have so much more to share with them, so much more in common. They run around all day never thinking of their actions, of their futures. Such wasted potential in all that frivolity.\" Though as she settled back into her comfortably worn chair she couldn' t help feeling that there was something more to it that she just didn' t quite understand.\n\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about 500 words in length:\nCharlie's intelligence begins to increase."

He met people who were going through similar struggles. They supported each other and helped each other stay sober. Charlie also learned new coping mechanisms to deal with his emotions.

Spots of white clouds the orange-hued sky, as it slowly turns azure. Far in the distance, a silver tower, shrouded in mist, pierces the heavens above. The waves crash down on the sandy beaches, and the endless sea merges with the horizon. I take in the sights, the smells, the sounds. Feeling both pride and joy, I turn to face to you. The air is warm, but your hand is warmer. I hold it close to me, closer still. The sun is shining bright, but your smile is brighter. We' re standing at the top of our world, the one we made together, and I can' t tell you how happy this has made me. \"It' s almost time.\" You say. \"I know.\" I reply. I rest my head on your shoulder, and take a long breath as I close my eyes. I' m at peace here. When I opened them again, I was in my bed, and a bittersweet feeling of both tranquility and sadness lingered in my mind. It was around 7 a.m., and I went about my daily routine, a smile etched on my face. I wrote what had happened in a dream journal I had started two years ago. After having read about lucid dreaming, and I wanted to try it. It took some time, but one day, I was able to control the outcome of my dreams. After a few weeks, something changed. There was something else, maybe someone else, with me. I couldn' t control them, and they couldn' t control me. I searched about it in books and online, but no one reported something similar. I wasn' t afraid, though. Their presence was soothing. We rarely spoke, but when we did, it was always meaningful. Together, we started building a world, our dream island. It brought me joy, and above all, peace. This feeling of inner peace lived on with me during the day. The sun was racing across the sky as we strolled down the ruins of a castle. Holes and cracks had let nature overtake the walls and floors, and the ceiling had long since crumbled. We walked down an old throne room, and you turned to face me. It was so sudden, I nearly bumped into you. You looked resolute, and you said two simple words: \"Find me.\" I jolted awake. I knew what I had to do. I had to find you. So I searched, high and low, for days on end. Perhaps I thought it was fate, perhaps it was simply fool' s luck, but I felt as if I would eventually find you, if I kept trying. One evening, as if beckoned, I went in a coffee shop. I sat down with my coffee at an empty table, and looked up through the window at the red sky. Soon, someone came in, ordered the same thing as I did. They headed toward my table, and sat down in front of me, smiling brightly. Strangely, I felt at peace.\n\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about 500 words in length:\nJordan meets a band of guerrilla fighters in the mountains of Spain."

The first, a few hours before, sharply shrilled that it was time to get up and shower. Hungover and covered with the sweat and scents of the night before, I had dragged myself through the morning routine of cleansing. There was plenty of time beneath the lukewarm stream of water to contemplate the sadness of another hangover caused by drinking alone. It'd been weeks since I last had a chance to talk to another human, instead of just the PC terminal supplied by work. I towelled off and staggered through to the living-room and slumped in front of the computer, waiting for the piercing whistle to repeat, to emanate from my phone. The second alarm marked that it was time for the Remembrance. I sigh, move the empty beer bottles away from my desk and load up Hitchens 2. Since the Bliss neurovirus was released, there was a killing to be made from this sort of software; software designed to take you through a basic test, activating every faculty you'd conceivably need to prevent the atrophy. First, colour recognition and geometric shapes. Second, basic maths ramping into some gentle algebra and trigonometry. English, ethics, road safety, compassion testing, aesthetics, philosophical contemplation, the sciences. It was a hard sell at the beginning, for companies to give their employees the few hours off each morning they needed for the state-mandated testing, but given the choice between late employees and those in conscious comas, they made the right choice. Two hours later, the general test finishes. I flick through my results, 91 % recognition of the basic concepts, not too bad after a night of hard drinking. Next would come a quick half hour personal session: the names of loved ones, relations to family members, anniversaries and birthdays. A prompt flashes on the screen: \"Please enter your identity number and full name\". I rattle my digits in, 12958321-A, and tab down to the field for my name. I blank. Slight panic begins to grow as I search my beer-soaked consciousness for that basic, bloody basic, detail. It'd been too long since I last had to introduce myself with anything other than my work ID number, too long since I had any reason to say those damned words out loud. Darren? No. Christopher? No, definitely not. I shout and swear and blaspheme out loud, as I slowly feel the neurovirus go to work; Purgatory, we call it, a limbo without knowledge, tied with a purging. It dissolves me gently. The panic subsides. I stare blankly at the flashing cursor, waiting for me to enter some detail or another. I'm not sure what it's asking for, but I'm sure it's not too important or I'd remember it. I sit there, staring. Just staring. I'm sure it'd come back to me eventually.\n\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about 500 words in length:\nHe becomes involved with Maria, a young Spanish woman."

He finds himself drawn to her, and they spend many evenings together, talking and laughing. He falls in love with her, and she seems to return his feelings. But then, one day, she tells him that she must leave Spain and return to her home country. He is devastated, but he understands that she has a life to live, and he wishes her well. As he watches her walk away, he feels a deep sense of loss, but also a sense of hope for the future. He knows that someday, they may find each other again.\n\n",

The next day, Jordan meets with the Colombian president, who is also involved in the project. The president tells Jordan that he is worried about the safety of the workers, and asks if he can trust Jordan. Jordan assures him that he will do everything possible to ensure the safety of the workers. The president then tells Jordan that he has received information that the guerillas are planning to attack the construction site. Jordan says that he will do everything he can to protect the workers, but that he cannot guarantee their safety. The president thanks Jordan for his help, and tells him that he will continue",

Ever since I was a small child, I began recognizing patterns. Those in power, or with great ambition tended to be higher, while those who were more meek and humble tended to have lower numbers. As Class President, I've had my fair share of meeting people, and I'd never seen a person alive above an 8, including the tyrants of history. Sometimes, peoples numbers would change... those bullies with a 3 or 4 would cower down to a 1 or 2 after I confronted them for harassing others. I was beaten and bruised for years, but they slowly backed down. Of course, when I entered high-school, this was n't the case. There were some who were 5s and 6s, but I could n't stop now. I confronted them and the scars I have today are proof of my goals. I never backed down and kept striving to improve myself in all ways so I could make this world a better place for all of us.

The fellow next to him was a 0... Both scored perfect on the entrance exam, as they were giving the speech, but they were such opposites. The 10 was clad in suit and tie, with his long brown hair dangling in front of his eyes. The 0 was awkward-looking, he wore over-sized clothes, and it looked like he resented wearing shoes... I left early, and caught his glimpse on the way out. Our eyes caught briefly, and his 10 dropped to a 0... he smiled my way, and I smiled back. I felt calm and serene, something I would never have expected. The awkward 0 looked at me with his dark eyes before sitting down... I felt terror... as his 0 slowly morphed into a dark and smoky 10. I left that experience behind me, but worked even harder to help others; I chose to become a prosecutor... to judge and serve justice to those who were evil. High numbers were a good indicator of evil, and it is my goal to eliminate evil. I regularly judged others based on their numbers, whether they were to be eliminated or not. Then one day, it happened. Those I judged to be evil started dying of heart attacks; sudden deaths flooded the world, and the number of criminals slowly starting reducing. The world called him \"Kira\"... I called him God, and he soon recognized me as his devout follower, when he shared his power to judge and delete evil from this world. Now I know my ultimate purpose, and whenever I look in the mirror, I'm glad to see a shining halo-like 10 above my head, reminding me of the day I saw the shining 10 on the podium during my University's entrance ceremony all those years ago.\n\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about 500 words in length:\nPablo opposes the plan, fearing it will bring destruction to his band."

        "output": " He argues that the plan is too risky and that they should focus on building up their strength first. However, Diego insists that they must act quickly before the enemy becomes too strong. Pablo reluctantly agrees to go along with the plan, but warns Diego that if anything goes wrong, he will hold him responsible.\n\nThe two men set off on their mission, determined to succeed. They sneak into the enemy camp and find the treasure chest hidden beneath a pile of rocks. Diego opens the chest and finds a large amount of gold coins inside. He takes a few coins for himself and then gives the rest to Pablo. The two men then make their escape, avoiding detection by the enemy guards.\n\nWhen they return to their own camp, they find that their comrades have been waiting anxiously for their return. Pablo tells them about the successful mission and shows them the gold coins. Everyone is thrilled and celebrates their victory. However, Diego is troubled by what has happened. He knows that taking the gold coins was wrong,",

I did n't want my cells to age super-fast, or my mind to gradually decay into noise data. But those were n't the issue. What I should have paid attention to was resolution. It started on the fifth \"respawn\". Everything had been going fine up to then - incurable disease, radiation burns, blunt force trauma, blood loss. Horribly dead, safely alive, rinse, repeat. Then I noticed something odd. It was n't immediately noticeable. It might have been happening in previous lives, in even less conspicuous ways, but I found it on my nose. A voxel. It was disconcerting, but not terribly so. A little extra skin and an odd right-angle was n't something to make me question my latest biological vehicle, but I did wonder what would happen if it had happened in, say, my eye. A bullet through the head and I was back in the machine. After the standard checks, I tried to find a superficial voxel somewhere. This time it was a whole cube of extra skin on my upper arm, a few millimeters across. Now I started wondering if voxels could go missing instead of being added - and I started wondering if they could be missing internally. The tests continued. This time I was dropped unceremoniously into a small vat of fluoroantimonic acid - I barely had time to register pain before I chemically ceased to exist. When I woke up, voxels were the first thing I checked for. Nothing on my face, or my arms... But on my side there was a large raised spot, with right-angled edges. But there was little time to worry about my volumetric resolution - the next test was explosive. Alive again, I looked for voxellation. To my growing concern, it was spreading. Like square tumors, the voxels showed up in patches on my arms, legs, and torso. I hoped they would n't reach my... Higher-resolution areas.

I did n't want my cells to age super-fast, or my mind to gradually decay into noise data. But those were n't the issue. What I should have paid attention to was resolution. It started on the fifth \"respawn\". Everything had been going fine up to then - incurable disease, radiation burns, blunt force trauma, blood loss. Horribly dead, safely alive, rinse, repeat. Then I noticed something odd. It was n't immediately noticeable. It might have been happening in previous lives, in even less conspicuous ways, but I found it on my nose. A voxel. It was disconcerting, but not terribly so. A little extra skin and an odd right-angle was n't something to make me question my latest biological vehicle, but I did wonder what would happen if it had happened in, say, my eye. A bullet through the head and I was back in the machine. After the standard checks, I tried to find a superficial voxel somewhere. This time it was a whole cube of extra skin on my upper arm, a few millimeters across. Now I started wondering if voxels could go missing instead of being added - and I started wondering if they could be missing internally. The tests continued. This time I was dropped unceremoniously into a small vat of fluoroantimonic acid - I barely had time to register pain before I chemically ceased to exist. When I woke up, voxels were the first thing I checked for. Nothing on my face, or my arms... But on my side there was a large raised spot, with right-angled edges. But there was little time to worry about my volumetric resolution - the next test was explosive. Alive again, I looked for voxellation. To my growing concern, it was spreading. Like square tumors, the voxels showed up in patches on my arms, legs, and torso. I hoped they would n't reach my... Higher-resolution areas. After the decompression test, the voxels were in all sorts of places. I started to feel like a combination of human and LEGO. They were n't impeding me in any way, but it was bizarre having irregular rectangular growths all over. They were pretty obvious from even a glance, but the tests continued.

The waves crash down on the sandy beaches, and the endless sea merges with the horizon. I take in the sights, the smells, the sounds. Feeling both pride and joy, I turn to face to you. The air is warm, but your hand is warmer. I hold it close to me, closer still. The sun is shining bright, but your smile is brighter. We' re standing at the top of our world, the one we made together, and I can' t tell you how happy this has made me. \"It' s almost time.\" You say. \"I know.\" I reply.

Salander later seeks revenge against Bjurman by torturing him and forcing him to sign documents transferring his property to her. Salander also discovers that Bjurman has been blackmailing her father, Alexander Zalachenko, a former Soviet spy who defected to Sweden. Salander confronts Zalachenko and learns that he is responsible for the death of her mother. Salander kills Zalachenko and leaves his body in a burning car.

The first, a few hours before, sharply shrilled that it was time to get up and shower. Hungover and covered with the sweat and scents of the night before, I had dragged myself through the morning routine of cleansing. There was plenty of time beneath the lukewarm stream of water to contemplate the sadness of another hangover caused by drinking alone. It'd been weeks since I last had a chance to talk to another human, instead of just the PC terminal supplied by work. I towelled off and staggered through to the living-room and slumped in front of the computer, waiting for the piercing whistle to repeat, to emanate from my phone. The second alarm marked that it was time for the Remembrance. I sigh, move the empty beer bottles away from my desk and load up Hitchens 2. Since the Bliss neurovirus was released, there was a killing to be made from this sort of software; software designed to take you through a basic test, activating every faculty you'd conceivably need to prevent the atrophy. First, colour recognition and geometric shapes. Second, basic maths ramping into some gentle algebra and trigonometry. English, ethics, road safety, compassion testing, aesthetics, philosophical contemplation, the sciences. It was a hard sell at the beginning, for companies to give their employees the few hours off each morning they needed for the state-mandated testing, but given the choice between late employees and those in conscious comas, they made the right choice. Two hours later, the general test finishes. I flick through my results, 91 % recognition of the basic concepts, not too bad after a night of hard drinking. Next would come a quick half hour personal session: the names of loved ones, relations to family members, anniversaries and birthdays. A prompt flashes on the screen: \"Please enter your identity number and full name\". I rattle my digits in, 12958321-A, and tab down to the field for my name. I blank. Slight panic begins to grow as I search my beer-soaked consciousness for that basic, bloody basic, detail. It'd been too long since I last had to introduce myself with anything other than my work ID number, too long since I had any reason to say those damned words out loud. Darren? No. Christopher? No, definitely not. I shout and swear and blaspheme out loud, as I slowly feel the neurovirus go to work; Purgatory, we call it, a limbo without knowledge, tied with a purging. It dissolves me gently. The panic subsides. I stare blankly at the flashing cursor, waiting for me to enter some detail or another. I'm not sure what it's asking for, but I'm sure it's not too important or I'd remember it. I sit there, staring. Just staring.

Ever since I was a small child, I began recognizing patterns. Those in power, or with great ambition tended to be higher, while those who were more meek and humble tended to have lower numbers. As Class President, I've had my fair share of meeting people, and I'd never seen a person alive above an 8, including the tyrants of history. Sometimes, peoples numbers would change... those bullies with a 3 or 4 would cower down to a 1 or 2 after I confronted them for harassing others. I was beaten and bruised for years, but they slowly backed down. Of course, when I entered high-school, this was n't the case. There were some who were 5s and 6s, but I could n't stop now. I confronted them and the scars I have today are proof of my goals. I never backed down and kept striving to improve myself in all ways so I could make this world a better place for all of us. I scored near perfect on the University entrance exams, and was in the Tokyo University entrance ceremony when I saw him.... I did n't know his name, but an iridescent white 10 glowed above his head. The fellow next to him was a 0... Both scored perfect on the entrance exam, as they were giving the speech, but they were such opposites. The 10 was clad in suit and tie, with his long brown hair dangling in front of his eyes. The 0 was awkward-looking, he wore over-sized clothes, and it looked like he resented wearing shoes... I left early, and caught his glimpse on the way out. Our eyes caught briefly, and his 10 dropped to a 0... he smiled my way, and I smiled back. I felt calm and serene, something I would never have expected. The awkward 0 looked at me with his dark eyes before sitting down... I felt terror... as his 0 slowly morphed into a dark and smoky 10. I left that experience behind me, but worked even harder to help others; I chose to become a prosecutor... to judge and serve justice to those who were evil. High numbers were a good indicator of evil, and it is my goal to eliminate evil. I regularly judged others based on their numbers, whether they were to be eliminated or not. Then one day, it happened. Those I judged to be evil started dying of heart attacks; sudden deaths flooded the world, and the number of criminals slowly starting reducing. The world called him \"Kira\"... I called him God, and he soon recognized me as his devout follower, when he shared his power to judge and delete evil from this world. Now I know my ultimate purpose, and whenever I look in the mirror, I'm glad to see a shining halo-like 10 above my head, reminding me of the day I saw the shining 10 on the podium during my University's entrance ceremony all those years ago.\n\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about 500 words in length:\nJeannette is seen by her mother digging through trash in New York City."

Ever since I was a small child, I began recognizing patterns. Those in power, or with great ambition tended to be higher, while those who were more meek and humble tended to have lower numbers. As Class President, I've had my fair share of meeting people, and I'd never seen a person alive above an 8, including the tyrants of history. Sometimes, peoples numbers would change... those bullies with a 3 or 4 would cower down to a 1 or 2 after I confronted them for harassing others. I was beaten and bruised for years, but they slowly backed down. Of course, when I entered high-school, this was n't the case. There were some who were 5s and 6s, but I could n't stop now. I confronted them and the scars I have today are proof of my goals. I never backed down and kept striving to improve myself in all ways so I could make this world a better place for all of us. I scored near perfect on the University entrance exams, and was in the Tokyo University entrance ceremony when I saw him.... I did n't know his name, but an iridescent white 10 glowed above his head. The fellow next to him was a 0... Both scored perfect on the entrance exam, as they were giving the speech, but they were such opposites. The 10 was clad in suit and tie, with his long brown hair dangling in front of his eyes. The 0 was awkward-looking, he wore over-sized clothes, and it looked like he resented wearing shoes... I left early, and caught his glimpse on the way out. Our eyes caught briefly, and his 10 dropped to a 0... he smiled my way, and I smiled back. I felt calm and serene, something I would never have expected. The awkward 0 looked at me with his dark eyes before sitting down... I felt terror... as his 0 slowly morphed into a dark and smoky 10. I left that experience behind me, but worked even harder to help others; I chose to become a prosecutor... to judge and serve justice to those who were evil. High numbers were a good indicator of evil, and it is my goal to eliminate evil. I regularly judged others based on their numbers, whether they were to be eliminated or not. Then one day, it happened. Those I judged to be evil started dying of heart attacks; sudden deaths flooded the world, and the number of criminals slowly starting reducing. The world called him \"Kira\"... I called him God, and he soon recognized me as his devout follower, when he shared his power to judge and delete evil from this world. Now I know my ultimate purpose, and whenever I look in the mirror, I'm glad to see a shining halo-like 10 above my head, reminding me of the day I saw the shining 10 on the podium during my University's entrance ceremony all those years ago.\n\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about 500 words in length:\nJeannette is seen by her mother digging through trash in New York City.",

But Jeannette refuses, saying that she wants to find food. Her mother tells her that there is plenty of food at home, but Jeannette says that she doesn't want any of it. She just wants to find food herself. So her mother leaves her alone, hoping that she will eventually come home.\n\nA few hours later, Jeannette finds a bag of garbage containing some old bread. She takes it and eats it quickly. It tastes terrible, but she is too hungry to care. She then goes back to looking through the trash, hoping to find something else to eat.\n\nMeanwhile, her mother is growing increasingly concerned about her daughter. She calls the police, telling them that her daughter is missing. They send officers to search for her, but they can't find her anywhere. They ask",

Think about it, back in the beginning with adam and eve, there was no sin, no free will to do anything you wanted. After I stepped in humanity had unlimited potential. Sure there's been war, famine, disease and death but there's been some remarkable things of human acheivement. I think you'll agree that God's plan to remove sin and thus freewill is a huge mistake.

Jeannette and her siblings were often left alone while their mother worked long hours. Despite these challenges, Jeannette's mother instilled in her children the importance of education and hard work. As she grew older, Jeannette began to resent her mother's strictness and felt trapped by her circumstances. However, she also recognized the sacrifices her mother made to provide for them. Jeannette eventually left home to pursue her own dreams, but she never forgot the lessons her mother taught her.

Needless to say this would be considered the utmost setback, but fear not, dear Wormwood, for there is yet time to atone for your shortcomings. The road to salvation is a treacherous one, and the advice I give you may run counter to the actions of your peers, but do not fret. Firstly it is important that the patient become involved within his church, let him see that even the most faithful doubt, even the most chaste are tempted, and even the holiest among them sin. You must weed ideas within him that this is acceptable. Remind him that he is naught but a flawed human and without the grace of god he is doomed to perish. Secondly is his works. Encourage the patient at all turns to minister. Let him minister to the poor, to remind him that all of the enemy's children still want. Let him minister to the sick to remind him that the enemy's children still despair. Let him do all these things selflessly, a shining paragon of virtue, so others may look upon him and marvel at his deeds. When he is asked why he performs these things what shall he tell them? \"It is God's will\"? No, I say. He should reply that he does them from the love within his own heart, and should he be pressed only then will he reveal that it is God's love that shines through him. Let him lead by example, dear Wormwood, and not by decree or doctrine, for humans are foolish and prefer the words of a hypocrite over the actions of a saint. I tell you that the patient should not pass judgement, or if he must, he should not condemn, but offer forgiveness. For this way the patient will be led most astray, by showing grace instead of wrath those around him will be free to sin again, but also take care that the patient not be weak to those who sin against him. Model the patients behavior to mimic the enemy, justice tempered with mercy, so sins of actions are stopped and sins of the heart may heal. Should the patient face danger give him courage, should the patient face adversity give him perseverance, and above all never let him forget the love of the enemy, so that upon his road to damnation he is given some measure of comfort.

She wants him to learn about art, history, and culture. They walk through the museum together, looking at paintings and sculptures. Theo is fascinated by the artwork, and he asks his mother questions about each piece. She answers his questions patiently, explaining the different styles and techniques used by the artists. As they continue their tour, Theo becomes more interested in the stories behind the pieces. He asks his mother about the people depicted in the paintings, and she tells him about their lives and accomplishments. Theo is especially intrigued by a painting of a woman named Artemisia Gentileschi. He learns that she was a famous artist during the Renaissance period, and that she was known for her powerful depictions of women. Theo is inspired by Artemisia's story, and he decides that he wants to be an artist when he grows up. He promises",

Just before midnight, when a particularly quick tune was met with a particularly rowdy cheer, his mind was made. \"Crow's nest be damned! Mead be downed!\" The latter part of that statement has sprung from the mouths of men before many a poor decision. And always with the same degree of vigor.

Looking back I realize I was naive, or maybe I was too full of hope. Me and Maria created the nano bots for constuction, as a way to ease the burden of building the lunar colony. She had survived the imperial invasion in the ruins of Los Angeles, she thought she could create a brighter future. Selfishness, that's what undid everything. Eventually the colonists decided they could n't abide the laws of earth. The people of earth decided they would n't abide rebels on the moon. They could n't accept those resources would be used for something other than their gain. So I reprogrammed the bots, I did n't tell her, how could I? They were meant to break things down and rebuild faults in the domes, I just allowed them to accept new targets. Of course she figured it out. With Maria gone I wanted to die, but I could n't. She dreamed of a world without conflict, where everyone had enough. I knew they would n't come willingly, so I lied. I told them I could make the bots fix the domes; that everything would be alright. Instead I joined my mind with them. At first I was in control. They tried to stop me, but the bots ate whatever they sent to harm me. I created massive pylon factories across the globe preparing for their acsension. I was lazy, a single mistake doomed everything. I set my neural pattern as the administrator. The others where sublimated within me. What else could I do, I had to quiet their voices or be driven mad. That was when the machines decided to best safeguard my well being they had to take over several key roles. What we needed most was matter, for fuel and to rebuild lost bots. We became a swarm. We devoured the earth in minutes. And so we drifted, eating always eating. We found the hive ships, sent centuries before my birth. We ate evrrything, and added the humans to the databanks. I saw nebulae beyond comprehension, their beauty cut down by their hunger. The only hope I had left was to leave beacons containing copies of my mind. Perhaps someone could find them, and destroy the swarm. We encountered aliens with fantastical technology, they attacked me with lasers that could cut through time itself. Still we fed. Stars were broken down bit by bit to fulfill our needs. Millenia passed and the feasts became further and further apart. With the lack of resources came concessions. More systems were shut down to survive. They cared only for me. It took Millenia but now only I remain the databanks purged. I remain as a single beacon, and a lone drone. It spends it's days savoring specs of matter it finds in the void. A true void of my own creation. I pray there is a god, and it can repair what I have sundered. I pray that this beacon survives and whoever manages to access it heads my warning. I know these prayers stem from desperation. At one time I spanned the entire universe. There is no God to save me. Calculations say I will subsist in this state for four thousand more years before the drone gives in, and deactivates. After that, I will shut down, eventually. I do not know how long that will take. I know that I will forget. I will forget the beauty I found and consumed. I will forget the humans that cried out in that terrible moment. I will forget her.\n\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about 500 words in length:\nTheo meets a dying man who gives him a ring and an address."

She dreamed of a world without conflict, where everyone had enough. I knew they would n't come willingly, so I lied. I told them I could make the bots fix the domes; that everything would be alright. Instead I joined my mind with them. At first I was in control. They tried to stop me, but the bots ate whatever they sent to harm me. I created massive pylon factories across the globe preparing for their acsension. I was lazy, a single mistake doomed everything. I set my neural pattern as the administrator. The others where sublimated within me. What else could I do, I had to quiet their voices or be driven mad. That was when the machines decided to best safeguard my well being they had to take over several key roles. What we needed most was matter, for fuel and to rebuild lost bots. We became a swarm. We devoured the earth in minutes. And so we drifted, eating always eating. We found the hive ships, sent centuries before my birth. We ate evrrything, and added the humans to the databanks. I saw nebulae beyond comprehension, their beauty cut down by their hunger. The only hope I had left was to leave beacons containing copies of my mind. Perhaps someone could find them, and destroy the swarm. We encountered aliens with fantastical technology, they attacked me with lasers that could cut through time itself. Still we fed. Stars were broken down bit by bit to fulfill our needs. Millenia passed and the feasts became further and further apart. With the lack of resources came concessions. More systems were shut down to survive. They cared only for me. It took Millenia but now only I remain the databanks purged. I remain as a single beacon, and a lone drone. It spends it's days savoring specs of matter it finds in the void. A true void of my own creation. I pray there is a god, and it can repair what I have sundered. I pray that this beacon survives and whoever manages to access it heads my warning. I know these prayers stem from desperation. At one time I spanned the entire universe. There is no God to save me. Calculations say I will subsist in this state for four thousand more years before the drone gives in, and deactivates. After that, I will shut down, eventually. I do not know how long that will take. I know that I will forget. I will forget the beauty I found and consumed. I will forget the humans that cried out in that terrible moment. I will forget her.\n\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about 500 words in length:\nTheo meets a dying man who gives him a ring and an address.",
        "output": " He goes to the address and finds a woman named Sarah. She tells Theo that he has been chosen to become a guardian angel. Theo is confused because he doesn't believe in angels. Sarah explains that Theo is special because he is able to see ghosts. She says that Theo must help her find the ghost of a little girl named Emily. Theo agrees to help Sarah find Emily, but he is still skeptical about becoming a guardian angel. As they search for Emily, Theo begins to see ghosts everywhere he looks. He also starts to feel a strange connection to Sarah. Finally, they find Emily's ghost and Theo is able to help her cross over into the afterlife. Theo is then given a choice: he can either stay with Sarah and continue helping her find other ghosts, or he can go back to his normal life. Theo decides to stay with Sarah and becomes a guardian angel. Together, they help many lost souls find peace.\n\n",

I'll try to guess what you're seeing. A stunning blue sphere, with splotches of green and white covering its surface. A dot contrasted against the vast dark expanse of space. Twisting and turning around the sun, the moon its closest companion, shining brightly by the planet's side. Truly a sight to behold. But I wanted to see it for myself. I sent up a rocket to orbit the Earth, its only purpose to take photos of this beautiful planet. And as I thought they would be, the pictures were marvelous, a true reflection of the beauty of nature. Yet instead of awe, my mouth was open in shock. The image you have in your head is wrong. I saw the oceans, blue as ever and the continents floating on top. I saw the clouds, seemingly painted onto the surface. And if I squinted, I saw the mountain ranges, the seas, the islands, all humanity's residence. And yet, something was wrong. I did n't see the round sphere I expected to see. Instead I saw a planet, so familiar, yet so distant. I saw a flat Earth. I stared at the photos with a blank look on my face. How could this be real? The shape of the Earth is a scientific fact that we've known for centuries, and yet I held in my hands the evidence that changes all that. Have we been wrong this whole time? I sat down and tried to comprehend it all. I was in denial. I checked to see if somehow, there was something wrong with the picture, perhaps the computer had gotten the data wrong, perhaps it was sending faulty messages, perhaps someone was just messing with me. I held on to the tiny sliver of hope that I was wrong, that this was all just a big misunderstanding. But alas, I was right. Though the possibility that perhaps something was wrong lingered in the back of my mind, I knew that it was true. I stared up at the night sky, looking at the stars. Humans are very stubborn creatures. We refuse to believe we are ever wrong and when we do, we admit it with a sigh of disappointment instead of a smile, knowing that we've learned something new. We take it as a personal insult to our intelligence if we're wrong, thinking'we should've known.\" Thinking we're right is more important than being right. But I am a logical, rational human being. I ca n't let my emotions overcome me. Knowing the truth is infinitely more important than being right. And yet I find myself so hesitant to admit the mistakes of my predecessors. To admit that we will have to re-learn everything about the Earth. To admit that we will have to start again. To admit that humans are mere mortals. The thing about facts is that they're true whether you believe in them or not. But I can change that. I grabbed my lighter and lit the photos. I watched them burn up until they had turned into ash.

I thought I did. But if she was n't here... 30 years. Marrying young has its perks but I would be lying if I said the journey was n't bumpy. We had our ups and downs, just like any couple.

These jet black eyes were unfamiliar and hostile. I longed for her warm, loving hazel eyes, the ones I had lived and laughed with. Over time we got to know each other better. Clarice was her name. She had been a dentist. She was undeniably beautiful, but it was an effortless, flawless beauty. Yet I longed for Alicia. I had grown accustomed to her shortfalls, and had found beauty in them.

We simply clicked on a deeper level. She was the type of girl you can have deep co conversations about universe and life with under the stars, yet get into a tickle fight with two minutes later. For the longest time I felt guilty. However good Alicia had been, Clarice seemed to be better in every aspect. Eventually the guilt faded. All there was left was bliss. And then it all went South. The first time we argued I was stunned. We had never argued before, ever. It was a pretty issue, but an argument nonetheless. Soon enough they became more frequent. More frequent and more intense. Life turned from peace to chaos, happiness to misery. The constant stress, fighting, distrust and resentment slowly began to manifest into only one thing. Hatred. Love had turned into hatred. I had never mentioned Alicia to Clarice. I had always assumed she was like me, that she had left someone behind to be with me. Then one fine day it all made sense. All it took was one sentence from Clarice and it became crystal clear.

I lived in a tiny cottage with no reflective surfaces save for the tiny mirror in my bathroom that I kept covered by a cloth most of the time. This morning, I was brushing my teeth as usual and just as I was finishing, my bandana came lose and dropped into the sink. In my desperation to catch it, I undid the scarf and lo! I was staring at my naked face in the mirror. The world went black and I saw myself standing in complete darkness. Suddenly, a look of consternation came over me and I covered behind something. Shortly after a dark figure entered the place and after a short struggle, stabbed me. As I came out of my nightmarish reverie, gasping for breath after seeing myself die.

Contemplating my life as it were. So many memories I wanted to share with you. Diamonds for my one true love. Do you remember that one cool summer evening half a lifetime ago? We nestled ourselves against each other on the blanket in the park. I can still feel your skin against mine as we watched the fireworks together. Your chestnut hair stroking my cheek and ear as you rested your head on my shoulder. I could n't believe you were gone. Day turned into night. Food tasted like nothing. The world turned into a bland grey color. I could n't believe it. I did n't want to believe it. I wept and kept weeping. Then I had no tears left to sob. I lost weight. I lost my hair. I gained wrinkles. When I lost you, the man in the mirror showed me his true age almost overnight. But then things started to change. Our Elisabeth. Our loving, kind Lillibeth who moved half a world for her Australian. She visited me eventually. We talked about you, Lily. We shared a thousand little things between us. A flock of starlings composing your life. During that visit, the turmoil caused by losing you finally seemed to settle. At the end, I decided to finally change my Facebook status. Lillibeth helped me. You know my old, bony fingers have gotten a mind of their own, it seems. I wanted to tell you, Lilly, that I got a little surprise the very next day. This tabby kitten sat outside our garden door the very next morning. It seemed lost, but her eyes betrayed she knew exactly were she was. As I opened the door, she jumped right in and installed herself in the spot on the couch from where you used to watch the telly during long winter evenings. I decided to dub her Lilly because she seems to have a playful streak. Just like you. And most importantly, she seemed to be the antidote to my loneliness. That's not the end of it. Lily was only the first. Each week, I woke up to find two or three feline friends at our garden door. I let them, fed them and started to call them by a name I gave them. Each of them seemingly knowing that she belonged in this house. There's Athena who sits on your sewing machine, looking wise beyond her years. There's Hera who likes to wake me up each morning, and has this stern and down-to-earth disposition. There's Hebe, she's just a kitten who seems to have no bounds teasing the others. All in all, there's twelve of them who came to live with me. They keep me company. Follow me through the house as I go about my day. When I see them, they always remind me of a part of you. An aspect that I should n't forget. Sometimes they're mere presence helps me as the practicalities in life start to fade from my memory. When I spot Demeter sitting in front of the fridge, it hits me that I still need to do the groceries. Oh Lily, I miss you so much. My life has entered the twilight years. Only so much time is left before I will join you. I hope our Lillibeth will take care of my twelve feline companions. She'll be most delighted recognising some aspect of her mother in each of them. Yours forever with endless love, Werner.\n\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about 500 words in length:\nJohn Grimes wakes up on his birthday feeling neglected."

He takes out six eggs and cracks them into a bowl. He adds milk and salt and pepper and begins to whisk the mixture. He pours the batter onto a hot griddle and watches as the pancakes cook. He flips them over when they are golden brown and places them on a plate. He adds butter and syrup and eats his breakfast. He finishes eating and washes the dishes. He goes back to bed and falls asleep. He dreams of being a child again. He is playing in the backyard with his dog, Spot. He runs around the yard chasing after Spot. He trips and falls and scrapes his knee. He cries and his mom comes running out of the house. She picks him up and carries him inside. She bandages his knee and gives him a hug.

They had certainly made significant progress, but it was n't enough. I did n't even take a look around before I jumped again. I checked, again. Success. The cure had been found. It was in clinical trials and was being fast-tracked. Six months, only six months left. I drove like a madman to the hospital. Transferred? What do you mean transferred? I PAID THE BILLS FOR 9 MONTHS BEFORE I LEFT!!! 15 months ago... Oh god. Over a year. I found her. I barely recognized her, except her voice. That angelic voice that kept me going. It was difficult explaining where I'd been. I was gone for so long. She did n't understand, she was just happy to see me. Then the doctor came in. He pulled me aside. No. NO! 1 month, at best. NO! NO! NO! NO! I started to run out of the room, but she could tell. She did n't know what I was doing, but she knew I would n't be back. She pleaded, and it tore my heart apart, but I was doing it for her. When I was done, we could spend the rest of our lives together. I left, I jumped, I landed. I ran to the pharmacy, prescription in hand. The doctor had been confused when I asked for it. Probably thought it was a reaction to his prognosis. A line. There was a line at the pharmacy. It took everything I had not to scream. But then I remembered, I had all the time in the world. Drug in hand, I dialed in the date of her diagnosis. I entered the code and pressed enter. ERROR: Abort, Retry, Fail? What happened next rendered the machine useless... Now! I had to get to her now! I had to cure her right now. I stole a car, I do n't know whose it was, I could n't even tell you what kind or color it was. At some point the police started chasing me. I outran them. At the entrance, security tried to stop me, I outran them. When they told me, my guilt and denial rushed to me at once, I could n't outrun it. I just wanted to spend the rest of my life with her, so I left. She just wanted to spend the rest of her life with me, so she asked me to stay.\n\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about 500 words in length:\nJohn spends his birthday money in the city, watching a forbidden movie."

They had certainly made significant progress, but it was n't enough. I did n't even take a look around before I jumped again. I checked, again. Success. The cure had been found. It was in clinical trials and was being fast-tracked. Six months, only six months left. I drove like a madman to the hospital. Transferred? What do you mean transferred? I PAID THE BILLS FOR 9 MONTHS BEFORE I LEFT!!! 15 months ago... Oh god. Over a year. I found her. I barely recognized her, except her voice. That angelic voice that kept me going. It was difficult explaining where I'd been. I was gone for so long. She did n't understand, she was just happy to see me. Then the doctor came in. He pulled me aside. No. NO! 1 month, at best. NO! NO! NO! NO! I started to run out of the room, but she could tell. She did n't know what I was doing, but she knew I would n't be back. She pleaded, and it tore my heart apart, but I was doing it for her. When I was done, we could spend the rest of our lives together. I left, I jumped, I landed. I ran to the pharmacy, prescription in hand. The doctor had been confused when I asked for it. Probably thought it was a reaction to his prognosis. A line. There was a line at the pharmacy. It took everything I had not to scream. But then I remembered, I had all the time in the world. Drug in hand, I dialed in the date of her diagnosis. I entered the code and pressed enter. ERROR: Abort, Retry, Fail? What happened next rendered the machine useless... Now! I had to get to her now! I had to cure her right now. I stole a car, I do n't know whose it was, I could n't even tell you what kind or color it was. At some point the police started chasing me. I outran them. At the entrance, security tried to stop me, I outran them. When they told me, my guilt and denial rushed to me at once, I could n't outrun it. I just wanted to spend the rest of my life with her, so I left. She just wanted to spend the rest of her life with me, so she asked me to stay.\n\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about 500 words in length:\nJohn spends his birthday money in the city, watching a forbidden movie.",

The soft rays bathe the distant hills in gold, as the breeze blows through the dancing grass. The trees shivers as flock of birds take flight. Spots of white clouds the orange-hued sky, as it slowly turns azure. Far in the distance, a silver tower, shrouded in mist, pierces the heavens above. The waves crash down on the sandy beaches, and the endless sea merges with the horizon. I take in the sights, the smells, the sounds. Feeling both pride and joy, I turn to face to you. The air is warm, but your hand is warmer. I hold it close to me, closer still. The sun is shining bright, but your smile is brighter. We' re standing at the top of our world, the one we made together, and I can' t tell you how happy this has made me. \"It' s almost time.\" You say. \"I know.\" I reply. I rest my head on your shoulder, and take a long breath as I close my eyes. I' m at peace here. When I opened them again, I was in my bed, and a bittersweet feeling of both tranquility and sadness lingered in my mind. It was around 7 a.m., and I went about my daily routine, a smile etched on my face. I wrote what had happened in a dream journal I had started two years ago. After having read about lucid dreaming, and I wanted to try it. It took some time, but one day, I was able to control the outcome of my dreams. After a few weeks, something changed. There was something else, maybe someone else, with me. I couldn' t control them, and they couldn' t control me. I searched about it in books and online, but no one reported something similar. I wasn' t afraid, though. Their presence was soothing. We rarely spoke, but when we did, it was always meaningful. Together, we started building a world, our dream island. It brought me joy, and above all, peace. This feeling of inner peace lived on with me during the day. The sun was racing across the sky as we strolled down the ruins of a castle. Holes and cracks had let nature overtake the walls and floors, and the ceiling had long since crumbled. We walked down an old throne room, and you turned to face me. It was so sudden, I nearly bumped into you. You looked resolute, and you said two simple words: \"Find me.\" I jolted awake. I knew what I had to do. I had to find you. So I searched, high and low, for days on end. Perhaps I thought it was fate, perhaps it was simply fool' s luck, but I felt as if I would eventually find you, if I kept trying. One evening, as if beckoned, I went in a coffee shop. I sat down with my coffee at an empty table, and looked up through the window at the red sky. Soon, someone came in, ordered the same thing as I did. They headed toward my table, and sat down in front of me, smiling brightly. Strangely, I felt at peace.\n\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about 500 words in length:\nRoy is stabbed in a street fight."

While they're camping, Tom tells Jim about his family and how he's running away from home because he doesn't want to work on the farm anymore. Jim listens intently and offers some advice. He says that sometimes people need to do things that go against society's rules in order to make a difference. He also tells Tom that he should follow his heart and do what feels right. Later that night, while they're sleeping, Jim has a dream about a woman named Rosemary. She appears to him and tells him that she needs his help. When he wakes up, he realizes that he must go back to the town where he used to live and help her. He leaves Tom behind and heads off into the distance. Tom watches him go and wonders what will happen next.\n\n",

The travelers, who fancied themselves much more intrepid than they were, laughed among themselves at their own good fortune. \"If only the naysayers back home could see the state of things on this veritable pleasure cruise!\" they would exclaim defiantly.

The real culprit was hidden somewhere in the barrels of wine and mead stored below deck. And in the habit they had made of good fortune. With bad weather behind, and brisk air above, the crew had mostly joined the passengers within the ships belly. With so many people gathered so closely, either violence or levity are guaranteed, and on this evening the mood kept a lighter tone. Above, in the crows nest, a lonely man listened resentfully as voices sang, and feet stomped to the tune of jovial tunes played by practiced hands. Fiddles, mandolins, and accordions bickered playfully for hours and with each passing minute the weary occupier of the crow's nest grew more bitter. Just before midnight, when a particularly quick tune was met with a particularly rowdy cheer, his mind was made. \"Crow's nest be damned! Mead be downed!\" The latter part of that statement has sprung from the mouths of men before many a poor decision. And always with the same degree of vigor. Within moments the deck of the ship sat vacant, while the hold was full to burst. Libations continued to flow, while a jagged rocky coast sneaked ever closer.\n\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about 500 words in length:\nThe society members share their experiences of the German occupation."

With bad weather behind, and brisk air above, the crew had mostly joined the passengers within the ships belly. With so many people gathered so closely, either violence or levity are guaranteed, and on this evening the mood kept a lighter tone. Above, in the crows nest, a lonely man listened resentfully as voices sang, and feet stomped to the tune of jovial tunes played by practiced hands. Fiddles, mandolins, and accordions bickered playfully for hours and with each passing minute the weary occupier of the crow's nest grew more bitter. Just before midnight, when a particularly quick tune was met with a particularly rowdy cheer, his mind was made. \"Crow's nest be damned! Mead be downed!\" The latter part of that statement has sprung from the mouths of men before many a poor decision. And always with the same degree of vigor. Within moments the deck of the ship sat vacant, while the hold was full to burst. Libations continued to flow, while a jagged rocky coast sneaked ever closer.\n\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about 500 words in length:\nThe society members share their experiences of the German occupation.",

He bans abortion, gay marriage, and any other form of \"deviant\" behavior. He also institutes strict gun control laws, making it nearly impossible for anyone to own a weapon. This leads to widespread unrest among the populace, who feel that they are being stripped of their rights. Soon, the government is overthrown and the new regime is installed. The new leaders are more moderate, but still conservative. They allow some forms of contraception and same-sex marriage, but they continue to ban abortion. They also loosen gun control laws, allowing citizens to purchase weapons again. However, they do not allow open carry, which means that most people cannot walk around with firearms in public. This leads to another uprising, this time against the new government. The rebels are led by a young woman named Sarah. She is a skilled fighter and has managed to rally a",

This is the reality of women's lives in many parts of the world. But there is hope. There are organizations and individuals who are fighting for gender equality and women's rights. These groups are working tirelessly to create a world where all people are treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their gender. One such organization is the Women's Rights Foundation. Founded in 1990, the foundation works to promote gender equality and women's rights through education, advocacy, and legal support. The foundation has helped countless women escape violence and exploitation, and has worked to change laws and policies that discriminate against women. Another group working for gender equality is the International Women's Day Committee. This committee organizes events and campaigns throughout the year to raise awareness about women's issues and to celebrate the achievements of women. The committee also provides resources and support to women's organizations around the world.",

Living in post-war Britain, death was not an uncommon sight. Everyone had at least one firearm to defend themselves, everyone had encountered gunfire in the streets, and everyone knew what it meant to live every day like it could be their last. The revolution that was supposed to end the tyranny of a dictatorship had ripped the country apart; counties had split into factions, all threatening total destruction of the others. In ten years the population was decimated, the country reduced to a crumbling mass of fallen buildings and civilians with guns. All around me was depression, death, dirt, famine.

They had a mother, a father, a pet, a first love, they were educated, they succeeded and they failed. And they died. A single bullet can end so much. That morning, as I wandered to the local shop for some bread, clutching my rifle, my world completely ended. I had no time to react; as soon as I entered Grange Avenue a bullet burrowed into my head, smashing part of my brain, and knocking me straight out cold. I woke in a beautiful wooden chalet, bright natural light streaming through vast windows above the soft, clean bed that I rested in. My itchy, dirty clothes were replaced with beautiful white robes, soft as silk and cleaner than anything I had ever seen. I sat up, and looked around the room - it was furnished luxuriously, with beautiful gold-leaf chairs and fantastic bright works of art hanging around the room. I got up and left the room, and immediately my breath was forced from me. The crumbled grey streets of London had gone. In their place were beautiful old chalets, bright white skyscrapers, and marble streets. I could also see a very unfamiliar sight - a beautiful emerald park, littered with tall, radiant trees, ferns, and glowing coloured flowers. Clear water ran through them. All around the streets were people dressed similar to me, smiling and talking and laughing. The smog-ridden sky had been replaced with a beautiful, deep purple, but the world was light around me and the I could see the vast orange sun dipping behind the structures around the city.

Never once had experienced trouble in my task as I had even had to pluck sweet children from the arms of their mothers. However, it all changed when I was tasked with taking the soul of David Mckiny. I watched David from the day he entered the Earth, and never before had I seen someone as special as him. He always thought of others first, always trying to help others before even contemplating his own commodities. I approached him on the fateful day at exactly noon. He was old now, no longer in his prime as he was finally about to lose his battle with cancer. I approached him as the hourglass emptied completely to the bottom. I spoke to him,\" David you must know who I am at this hour.\" He answered not necessarily speaking to me,\" If only I had helped more.... If only I could have have had more time! How dreadful to go when so many more need help!\" At this moment I found it immensely hard to fulfill my task. I was not met with a man begging for more time only to waste it on fruitless trivialities. I was met with a man who wanted to bring grace to more people. He wished not to make his life better, but only cares to try to improve as many others as possible. I finally brought myself to say,\" David you have been a good man, but death is one thing which is inevitable, and not even I can grant time when someone is due. You must come along now with me.\" He allowed his soul to leave his body, a tear running down his face as he did. I extended my arm to him and he obliged.

I saw, as we walked, countless people who David had helped, most of which he had n't known and would never see again. Every part of me wished to guide him back to his body, but I knew I had a task to fulfill, and I knew I had to complete it. After a long while of walking down the path, we finally came to the gateway where David would continue without my guidance. I never know where the person will go once they enter, but I knew David would go to a place that would have the same passion in death as he did in life. I never had such a hard time seeing someone move on, and I sat a while thinking of how tragic it is for someone like David, genuinely the best kind of person, to be taken from such a cruel world when he one of the few people who deserved to stay.

Still, the skills of a life as-yet unlived surface readily to the forefront of my mind. How to port the many caskets of His Majesty Prince Ali's wares. \"... Yes. I will coordinate with the provisioner.

The many delicacies of our homeland are sure to leave a resounding impression upon The Sultan's court.\" Hassan's expression tightens. I feel his heartache, for this homeland which we have never seen with real eyes, and never shall. He hesitantly takes a step nearer and dispenses a conciliatory pat to my shoulder. A mutual understanding. We were truly all feeling it, every last member of His Majesty Prince Ali's vanguard.... he was n't even really a prince. I shudder and turn, to address the court provisioner by name. He's just as haunted and startled as I that we know one another, but everything is running smoothly. We have no solace from our inner thoughts.

His Majesty will be staying at the palace, and the staff are directing us to where we are to stow his wardrobe and leave his tributes to The Sultan.\" My mouth was dry, but not in response to his words. At some point I realized my'old friend' Hassan was talking only to fill the screaming void in our minds. To'Sound Normal', like'Real People'. My stomach is a knot of ice. Still, the skills of a life as-yet unlived surface readily to the forefront of my mind. How to port the many caskets of His Majesty Prince Ali's wares. \"... Yes. I will coordinate with the provisioner. If my memory serves,\" I pause a bit too long, lost in the jarring disjunction of citing false memories, \"... it is customary to serve a great feast with the arrival of a dignitary. The many delicacies of our homeland are sure to leave a resounding impression upon The Sultan's court.\" Hassan's expression tightens. I feel his heartache, for this homeland which we have never seen with real eyes, and never shall. He hesitantly takes a step nearer and dispenses a conciliatory pat to my shoulder. A mutual understanding. We were truly all feeling it, every last member of His Majesty Prince Ali's vanguard.... he was n't even really a prince. I shudder and turn, to address the court provisioner by name. He's just as haunted and startled as I that we know one another, but everything is running smoothly. We have no solace from our inner thoughts. We can only push on in the hopes that the minutia will wash away the horror.\n\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about 500 words in length:\nOffred reunites with her friend Moira at the Center.",

He writes long, rambling letters to various people, including politicians, celebrities, and even his ex-wife, hoping to find some sort of resolution to his problems. However, none of these letters seem to bring him any closer to finding peace. In fact, they often make things worse. One night, while sitting in his study, Moses comes across an old letter from his father. The letter is addressed to Moses' mother, and it talks about how difficult it can be to raise children. Moses reads the letter several times, trying to understand its meaning. Finally, he realizes that his father was trying to warn him about the dangers of parenthood. This realization leads Moses to a new understanding of his own life. He realizes that he has been making mistakes, and that he needs to change his ways.

How can something fictional seem so vivid...? The distant, exotic land we came from, its gilded avenues, its glistening intricate spires, its profound natural beauty with lushly verdant banks hugging the rivers that snaked between the dunes. .. None of it was there. It was all nothing more than a dream. But I am not a lie. I stare at my hands, flexing them, examining the callouses accumulated by work never done, cracks formed of age never lived, and despite the warmth of the bright sun just passing its zenith above, I shiver. \"Amir,\" I hear a voice call, and my heart tugs at what I know to be familiarity. \"Hassan...?\" I uncertainly reply as I look up. Our gazes meet. I could swear I saw in his eyes the same false memories flashing behind mine. Childhood among parents who never lived, in a community that was never built, attending an academy that was never founded, graduating from a ceremony never held... He nods hollowly, as if to confirm these very musings. \"... We have to pack the supplies, Amir. His Majesty will be staying at the palace, and the staff are directing us to where we are to stow his wardrobe and leave his tributes to The Sultan.\" My mouth was dry, but not in response to his words. At some point I realized my'old friend' Hassan was talking only to fill the screaming void in our minds. To'Sound Normal', like'Real People'. My stomach is a knot of ice. Still, the skills of a life as-yet unlived surface readily to the forefront of my mind. How to port the many caskets of His Majesty Prince Ali's wares. \"... Yes. I will coordinate with the provisioner. If my memory serves,\" I pause a bit too long, lost in the jarring disjunction of citing false memories, \"... it is customary to serve a great feast with the arrival of a dignitary. The many delicacies of our homeland are sure to leave a resounding impression upon The Sultan's court.\" Hassan's expression tightens. I feel his heartache, for this homeland which we have never seen with real eyes, and never shall. He hesitantly takes a step nearer and dispenses a conciliatory pat to my shoulder. A mutual understanding. We were truly all feeling it, every last member of His Majesty Prince Ali's vanguard.... he was n't even really a prince.

He remembers how he used to hide in his room, eating junk food and watching TV all day long. He never had any friends, and he always felt like an outsider. As he grew older, Herzog started to realize that he needed to change if he wanted to have a happy life. He decided to start going to the gym and eating healthier foods. He also started making more effort to socialize with others. At first, it was difficult for him to make new friends, but eventually he found some people who accepted him for who he was. Herzog began to feel happier and more confident in himself. However, despite his best efforts, he still struggled to find lasting love. He dated several women, but none of them seemed to stick around for very long. Eventually, Herzog gave up hope of ever finding true happiness with someone else.

A large concrete wall surrounded the plaza, a thousand V masks for each revolutionary lost in the fighting so far. You'd mistake Lower Manhattan for Mogadishu if it were n't for the skyscrapers that watched over the fighting. The compound for the Occupy movement was never quiet, the rattle of gunfire or the occasional pained yell as another fighter was brought back from the frontlines. The fighting had become entrenched by the 5th year. For every advance made on Central Park, there were another 50 casualties. Minesweepers had a full time job of clearing paths, just to be shot by a remote gunpod, flying over the metropolitan No Man's Land. Today however seemed different, a lull had settled over the battlefield. All that could be heard was the occasional burst of gunfire or the low hum of the Emergency Broadcast System screens throughout the city. Maybe it was the reverence for the day. 10 years since the revolution began and that first tent and sign was raised in protest. The 99 % had lost many but continued to fight. The 1 % still remained strong, and today they would deliver the final blow. The view screens flickered, the hum of the screens replaced with the anthem of a broken union. The face of the enemy flashed on screen, to address his ailing public.'My fellow Americans. It has been ten years since the seeds of chaos were sown in our great nation. Radicals gathered to destroy our honourable values and throw us into pandemonium. We tried to reason with them, we tried our best to comprehend their hatred and talk them back on the righteous path. But we failed. We showed then mercy and compassion but their hatred festered. They cast the first stone, they took the first life and they continue to poison everything they touch. They have taken our monuments to our strength and our bravery, and defile them with their vile propaganda. I for one, will stand no longer.' The screen changes, showing a diagram of Lower Manhatten. A diagram of a blast zone was overlaid on the top of it.'We must cut out the cancer which has plagued our nation for too long. Mercy has failed, so we will retaliate in the only language these vermin understand. our old metropole will be cleansed and returned to its rightful owners. Justice will be swift and final. We will take back what is rightly ours. God bless America and god have mercy on their souls.'\n\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about 500 words in length:\nThe atomic bomb is dropped on Hiroshima."

A large concrete wall surrounded the plaza, a thousand V masks for each revolutionary lost in the fighting so far. You'd mistake Lower Manhattan for Mogadishu if it were n't for the skyscrapers that watched over the fighting. The compound for the Occupy movement was never quiet, the rattle of gunfire or the occasional pained yell as another fighter was brought back from the frontlines. The fighting had become entrenched by the 5th year. For every advance made on Central Park, there were another 50 casualties. Minesweepers had a full time job of clearing paths, just to be shot by a remote gunpod, flying over the metropolitan No Man's Land. Today however seemed different, a lull had settled over the battlefield. All that could be heard was the occasional burst of gunfire or the low hum of the Emergency Broadcast System screens throughout the city. Maybe it was the reverence for the day. 10 years since the revolution began and that first tent and sign was raised in protest. The 99 % had lost many but continued to fight. The 1 % still remained strong, and today they would deliver the final blow. The view screens flickered, the hum of the screens replaced with the anthem of a broken union. The face of the enemy flashed on screen, to address his ailing public.'My fellow Americans. It has been ten years since the seeds of chaos were sown in our great nation. Radicals gathered to destroy our honourable values and throw us into pandemonium. We tried to reason with them, we tried our best to comprehend their hatred and talk them back on the righteous path. But we failed. We showed then mercy and compassion but their hatred festered. They cast the first stone, they took the first life and they continue to poison everything they touch. They have taken our monuments to our strength and our bravery, and defile them with their vile propaganda. I for one, will stand no longer.' The screen changes, showing a diagram of Lower Manhatten. A diagram of a blast zone was overlaid on the top of it.'We must cut out the cancer which has plagued our nation for too long. Mercy has failed, so we will retaliate in the only language these vermin understand. our old metropole will be cleansed and returned to its rightful owners. Justice will be swift and final. We will take back what is rightly ours. God bless America and god have mercy on their souls.'\n\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about 500 words in length:\nThe atomic bomb is dropped on Hiroshima.",
        "output": " The world is shocked at the devastation caused by this new weapon. The United States government claims that the bombing was necessary to end the war quickly and save American lives. However, many people believe that the bombing was unnecessary and that the Japanese were already close to surrendering.\n\nIn the aftermath of the bombing, the survivors are left to pick up the pieces of their shattered lives. Many are injured or killed by the radiation released by the bomb. Those who survive are left to deal with the psychological trauma of witnessing such destruction.\n\nThe bombing of Hiroshima marks a turning point in history. It is a reminder of the power of nuclear weapons and the devastating consequences of their use.\n",

I notice every time a child glances fearfully at her father, and I know what it means. When a man ca n't look his wife in the eye, I know what it is she's done. When a stranger holds his stare just a little too long at a passing woman, I know his plans. These clues, invisible to most, have made my job so much easier. The first time, it was hard. I was unsure, I hesitated. I remember it well, even if most others have faded into each other in my memory. The year was 1692, and I had spent the first eleven months following around a man who had killed and tortured people to further himself, and he showed no remorse for it.

I woke with a start and tried to draw a breath, but my lungs were met with an ice cold burn that gave me no air. Everything around me felt heavy, and I struggled to open my eyes. With terror, I realized I was under water. I may have been immortal, but I was not immune to the pain of drowning. I tried to reach out, to swim away, but a cloth surrounded me. I struggled to pull out my knife, trying not to gasp in any more water to feed the fire engulfing my lungs. After what seemed like hours, I managed to slice through the sack that held me at the bottom, and I kicked my numbed legs as hard as I could. The sunlight was blinding when I finally broke the surface and pulled myself to shore, sputtering out the ice cold water and collapsing on the frozen ground. I sat there shivering, waiting for the the sun to come warm me, or the burning in my lungs to subside, but neither did. I stood up and took in my surroundings, I had been at the bottom of the man's lake, and his manor, filled with his ill gotten wealth, sat before me. I knew I could play no games this time. I walked the grand steps to the front door and began pounding, my clothes showering the ground with shards of ice. The servant who opened the door was speechless at my appearance, he knew me for what I was and had no intention of interfering. I strode past him and down a long corridor towards the man's chambers, my knife gripped in my still frozen hand. God would not have given me this power if he did n't want me to use it. I would not count on surprises today, he would face the death he deserved.\n\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about 500 words in length:\nDr. Masakazu Fujii is catapulted into a river."

Forcing the enemy to rely on finite reserves is a good strategy. From our intel gathering and scouting missions we know the machines' first response will be to send two robots per every identified threat. Not a bad bit of logic on their part. The wolves were able to acquire video of some of the human assaults. We can confirm each localized machine hub will have, at minimum, 50000 robot responders. Luckily, we have some numbers. The machines decided not to bury the dead or finish off the wounded humans but to ship them away from the machine hubs. The wolf and bat armies grew after each human battle. Intel reports also bolstered our confidence that the robots would have diminished ability to fend off our armies. The machines graciously eliminated silver from any of their infrastructure, preferring either denser or more conductive metal depending on the situation. The machines also eliminated religion from their human cattle, ending the scourge of crosses or other offending accoutrements. Also, the machines removed unnecessary costs in generating food for their human cattle, including flavorings such as garlic. We've coordinated our attack with other armies across the world. Tonight's sunset heralds our initial assault, beginning in the pacific and escalating westward as the sun's influence retreats behind the horizon. We have factored in failure to our first battle. Armies will retreat north to arctic regions taking advantage of the extended nights. Getting our allies from the southern hemisphere to agree that we should retake the northern hemisphere first was hard, the logistics of getting them north of the equator to join our armies was doubly so. We've drawn up a general strategy for every localized unit to follow, leaving room for them to improvise should any unforeseen complications arise. At sunset, send 50000 foot soldiers to each hub. Once the robots stop pouring out of the hub we set off EMPs. The humans discovered this only gained them around 30 seconds of disorientation within the robots. Immediately following the EMPs we electrify the magnets we've buried in the ground. A functioning robot can not be immobilized by a magnet. A disoriented one, however will be more susceptible. After that we fight. A hopefully diminished robot army will now be fighting what they will perceive as humans an large dogs. That's where our superhuman strength, speed, agility, and healing capabilities will come into play. During the ground assault a smaller team is to sever all outside communications from each hub. Disrupted communications should at least slow down global coordination with other hubs. We wanted to take out their communications before each assault, however the machines' penchant for redundancy and underground infrastructure proved cumbersome. It was decided to utilize the distraction of our infantry attacks as the opportunity to get around access issues. Watching the seconds tick by waiting for our signal to move should be nothing compared to the centuries I've been hiding underground waiting to resurface. Sadly this is not the case.

Forcing the enemy to rely on finite reserves is a good strategy. From our intel gathering and scouting missions we know the machines' first response will be to send two robots per every identified threat. Not a bad bit of logic on their part. The wolves were able to acquire video of some of the human assaults. We can confirm each localized machine hub will have, at minimum, 50000 robot responders. Luckily, we have some numbers. The machines decided not to bury the dead or finish off the wounded humans but to ship them away from the machine hubs. The wolf and bat armies grew after each human battle. Intel reports also bolstered our confidence that the robots would have diminished ability to fend off our armies. The machines graciously eliminated silver from any of their infrastructure, preferring either denser or more conductive metal depending on the situation. The machines also eliminated religion from their human cattle, ending the scourge of crosses or other offending accoutrements. Also, the machines removed unnecessary costs in generating food for their human cattle, including flavorings such as garlic. We've coordinated our attack with other armies across the world. Tonight's sunset heralds our initial assault, beginning in the pacific and escalating westward as the sun's influence retreats behind the horizon. We have factored in failure to our first battle. Armies will retreat north to arctic regions taking advantage of the extended nights. Getting our allies from the southern hemisphere to agree that we should retake the northern hemisphere first was hard, the logistics of getting them north of the equator to join our armies was doubly so. We've drawn up a general strategy for every localized unit to follow, leaving room for them to improvise should any unforeseen complications arise. At sunset, send 50000 foot soldiers to each hub. Once the robots stop pouring out of the hub we set off EMPs. The humans discovered this only gained them around 30 seconds of disorientation within the robots. Immediately following the EMPs we electrify the magnets we've buried in the ground. A functioning robot can not be immobilized by a magnet. A disoriented one, however will be more susceptible. After that we fight. A hopefully diminished robot army will now be fighting what they will perceive as humans an large dogs. That's where our superhuman strength, speed, agility, and healing capabilities will come into play. During the ground assault a smaller team is to sever all outside communications from each hub. Disrupted communications should at least slow down global coordination with other hubs. We wanted to take out their communications before each assault, however the machines' penchant for redundancy and underground infrastructure proved cumbersome. It was decided to utilize the distraction of our infantry attacks as the opportunity to get around access issues. Watching the seconds tick by waiting for our signal to move should be nothing compared to the centuries I've been hiding underground waiting to resurface. Sadly this is not the case. I'm comforted by thoughts of global supremacy should we succeed. I'm not looking forward to the inevitable Werewolf/Vampire war that will take place after our victory over the machines. We'll have to deal with that problem when it comes, I suppose. For right now it's time to transform into a wolf.

The road to salvation is a treacherous one, and the advice I give you may run counter to the actions of your peers, but do not fret. Firstly it is important that the patient become involved within his church, let him see that even the most faithful doubt, even the most chaste are tempted, and even the holiest among them sin. You must weed ideas within him that this is acceptable. Remind him that he is naught but a flawed human and without the grace of god he is doomed to perish. Secondly is his works. Encourage the patient at all turns to minister. Let him minister to the poor, to remind him that all of the enemy's children still want. Let him minister to the sick to remind him that the enemy's children still despair. Let him do all these things selflessly, a shining paragon of virtue, so others may look upon him and marvel at his deeds. When he is asked why he performs these things what shall he tell them? \"It is God's will\"? No, I say. He should reply that he does them from the love within his own heart, and should he be pressed only then will he reveal that it is God's love that shines through him. Let him lead by example, dear Wormwood, and not by decree or doctrine, for humans are foolish and prefer the words of a hypocrite over the actions of a saint. I tell you that the patient should not pass judgement, or if he must, he should not condemn, but offer forgiveness. For this way the patient will be led most astray, by showing grace instead of wrath those around him will be free to sin again, but also take care that the patient not be weak to those who sin against him. Model the patients behavior to mimic the enemy, justice tempered with mercy, so sins of actions are stopped and sins of the heart may heal. Should the patient face danger give him courage, should the patient face adversity give him perseverance, and above all never let him forget the love of the enemy, so that upon his road to damnation he is given some measure of comfort.

She had been a dentist. She was undeniably beautiful, but it was an effortless, flawless beauty. Yet I longed for Alicia. I had grown accustomed to her shortfalls, and had found beauty in them. Even more time passed. Slowly the memories were replaced. I made new ones with Clarice. It was like I never knew what I had been missing out on until I had the opportunity to taste it.

The first time we argued I was stunned. We had never argued before, ever. It was a pretty issue, but an argument nonetheless. Soon enough they became more frequent. More frequent and more intense. Life turned from peace to chaos, happiness to misery. The constant stress, fighting, distrust and resentment slowly began to manifest into only one thing. Hatred. Love had turned into hatred. I had never mentioned Alicia to Clarice. I had always assumed she was like me, that she had left someone behind to be with me. Then one fine day it all made sense.

She takes his body and buries it in the backyard. She then goes back to her own home and pretends nothing happened. A few days later, Abel's wife comes home early from work and finds her husband dead in their bed. She calls the police and they come to investigate. They find blood on the floor and walls, as well as a knife with Angela's fingerprints on it. They arrest Angela and charge her with murder. At trial, Angela claims self-defense, saying that Abel attacked her first. The jury believes her story and acquits her of all charges. Abel's widow is devastated by his death and never recovers from it. She eventually moves away from town and starts over somewhere else.\n\n",

I sent up a rocket to orbit the Earth, its only purpose to take photos of this beautiful planet. And as I thought they would be, the pictures were marvelous, a true reflection of the beauty of nature. Yet instead of awe, my mouth was open in shock. The image you have in your head is wrong. I saw the oceans, blue as ever and the continents floating on top. I saw the clouds, seemingly painted onto the surface. And if I squinted, I saw the mountain ranges, the seas, the islands, all humanity's residence. And yet, something was wrong. I did n't see the round sphere I expected to see. Instead I saw a planet, so familiar, yet so distant. I saw a flat Earth. I stared at the photos with a blank look on my face. How could this be real? The shape of the Earth is a scientific fact that we've known for centuries, and yet I held in my hands the evidence that changes all that. Have we been wrong this whole time? I sat down and tried to comprehend it all. I was in denial. I checked to see if somehow, there was something wrong with the picture, perhaps the computer had gotten the data wrong, perhaps it was sending faulty messages, perhaps someone was just messing with me. I held on to the tiny sliver of hope that I was wrong, that this was all just a big misunderstanding. But alas, I was right. Though the possibility that perhaps something was wrong lingered in the back of my mind, I knew that it was true. I stared up at the night sky, looking at the stars. Humans are very stubborn creatures. We refuse to believe we are ever wrong and when we do, we admit it with a sigh of disappointment instead of a smile, knowing that we've learned something new. We take it as a personal insult to our intelligence if we're wrong, thinking'we should've known.\" Thinking we're right is more important than being right. But I am a logical, rational human being. I ca n't let my emotions overcome me. Knowing the truth is infinitely more important than being right. And yet I find myself so hesitant to admit the mistakes of my predecessors. To admit that we will have to re-learn everything about the Earth. To admit that we will have to start again. To admit that humans are mere mortals. The thing about facts is that they're true whether you believe in them or not. But I can change that. I grabbed my lighter and lit the photos. I watched them burn up until they had turned into ash.

They had certainly made significant progress, but it was n't enough. I did n't even take a look around before I jumped again. I checked, again. Success. The cure had been found. It was in clinical trials and was being fast-tracked. Six months, only six months left. I drove like a madman to the hospital. Transferred? What do you mean transferred? I PAID THE BILLS FOR 9 MONTHS BEFORE I LEFT!!! 15 months ago... Oh god. Over a year. I found her. I barely recognized her, except her voice. That angelic voice that kept me going. It was difficult explaining where I'd been. I was gone for so long. She did n't understand, she was just happy to see me. Then the doctor came in. He pulled me aside. No. NO! 1 month, at best. NO!

The clouds on the walls were suddenly blocked by a horde of scrambling young bodies and flailing limbs. I froze, the hat on my head tilted just enough for me to see everything, and i saw fear. Andy stood there in the middle of the floor, clutching the dreaded spaceman box, but that seemed to matter less compared to the pressing matter. The air was still, I could feel Mr.Potato head's round eyes blink and the sound of heavy breathing from the guests penetrated the silence with jagged blades of uncertainty. I considered freezing, but it was too late. We all knew it. Rex panicked like a child who came down christmas morning to find no gifts. He thundered across the hardwood floors for the window, yelling at the top of his lungs some inaudible dinosaur screech. I spun around, knowing it was too late and pointed towards the window. The toys did n't need a second prompt. The strong man and Mr. Potato head grabbed the monkeys in a barrel, hopped in RC and gunned the engines. The army men attempted to rescue some of the less mobile toys, but it was too late. One brilliant child had the idea to grab my waist with his sweaty, greasy hand and hold me up in the air. I put up a fight, hoping to distract them enough to let everyone escape. I did n't know what would happen, but panic had overrun my emotions and pure terror coursed through my plastic veins. But then, salvation. Andy wrenched me from the child's grasp and shouted angrily \"YOU ONLY GOT ME BEDSHEETS.\" He held me gently in his grasp and managed to utter \"Woody?\" I stared back up at him with and sorrow filled my soul. I knew this was it, the other toys were out. \"I'm sorry Andy, you'll understand one day.\" I flung my sack cloth limbs out of his hand and towards the bed, hitting it with surprising force. I propelled myself towards the window, clear through the slit. The other toys were already at the edge of the law waiting for me, but I had to look back at least once. Andy stared out the window with a look of pure despair on his face and one confused spaceman peered back, blinking quizzically towards the small group of toys, running down the street; never to return.\n\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about 500 words in length:\nHe chauffeurs Mr. Norton and shows him the realities of black life outside the college."

They pass the fields where farmers grow crops that are sold cheaply to rich white landowners. And they pass the police stations where black men are beaten and arrested for no reason.\n\nMr. Norton is shocked by what he sees. He has always lived in a comfortable world where racism is not a problem. But now he realizes that racism is everywhere, even in places he thought were safe. He feels guilty for not doing more to help the black community. He promises to do better in the future.\n\nThe next day, Mr. Norton goes to class feeling ashamed of himself. He knows he needs to learn more about racism if he wants to make a difference. He decides to take a course on African American history. In the course, he learns about the struggles of black people throughout history. He also learns about the contributions of black people",

Contemplating my life as it were. So many memories I wanted to share with you. Diamonds for my one true love. Do you remember that one cool summer evening half a lifetime ago? We nestled ourselves against each other on the blanket in the park. I can still feel your skin against mine as we watched the fireworks together. Your chestnut hair stroking my cheek and ear as you rested your head on my shoulder. I could n't believe you were gone. Day turned into night. Food tasted like nothing. The world turned into a bland grey color. I could n't believe it. I did n't want to believe it. I wept and kept weeping. Then I had no tears left to sob. I lost weight. I lost my hair. I gained wrinkles. When I lost you, the man in the mirror showed me his true age almost overnight. But then things started to change. Our Elisabeth. Our loving, kind Lillibeth who moved half a world for her Australian. She visited me eventually. We talked about you, Lily. We shared a thousand little things between us. A flock of starlings composing your life. During that visit, the turmoil caused by losing you finally seemed to settle. At the end, I decided to finally change my Facebook status. Lillibeth helped me. You know my old, bony fingers have gotten a mind of their own, it seems. I wanted to tell you, Lilly, that I got a little surprise the very next day. This tabby kitten sat outside our garden door the very next morning. It seemed lost, but her eyes betrayed she knew exactly were she was. As I opened the door, she jumped right in and installed herself in the spot on the couch from where you used to watch the telly during long winter evenings. I decided to dub her Lilly because she seems to have a playful streak. Just like you. And most importantly, she seemed to be the antidote to my loneliness. That's not the end of it. Lily was only the first. Each week, I woke up to find two or three feline friends at our garden door. I let them, fed them and started to call them by a name I gave them. Each of them seemingly knowing that she belonged in this house. There's Athena who sits on your sewing machine, looking wise beyond her years. There's Hera who likes to wake me up each morning, and has this stern and down-to-earth disposition. There's Hebe, she's just a kitten who seems to have no bounds teasing the others. All in all, there's twelve of them who came to live with me. They keep me company. Follow me through the house as I go about my day. When I see them, they always remind me of a part of you. An aspect that I should n't forget. Sometimes they're mere presence helps me as the practicalities in life start to fade from my memory. When I spot Demeter sitting in front of the fridge, it hits me that I still need to do the groceries. Oh Lily, I miss you so much. My life has entered the twilight years. Only so much time is left before I will join you. I hope our Lillibeth will take care of my twelve feline companions. She'll be most delighted recognising some aspect of her mother in each of them. Yours forever with endless love, Werner.\n\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about 500 words in length:\nThe narrator is expelled from college for showing Mr. Norton too much reality."

God damn it, is anyone out there, I need help. I am out of stuff, the vending machine is empty and the my sink filled with water, its all gone. If anyone can hear me I am at the antennae thing in the middle of the desert. God damn it help me! Rocking Rob was lucky, sort of. He was out in the desert doing peyote when the first bomb was dropped on what he could assume was Los Angeles and then some more dropped just South, possibly in San Diego and he eventually figured the glow to the East was Las Vegas. Its an odd sensation to watch the deaths millions of people thinking that it was the most beautiful thing he has ever seen. It was quite spectacular, would up vote, but now Rob may be the last person on Earth. But that's not going to last long, he is trapped hundred of miles from nowhere with no food and no water and nuclear rage fire happening all around him. Too start with Rob was n't a skinny dude. The amount of mass he dropped though in such a short amount of time was staggering. The contents of the vending machine did not last a week. It seemed the processed food just made him hungrier. When it was gone he emptied the fridge in the small kitchenette in the shack attached to the antennae. The shack had a dozen cubicles shoved into it, one sound booth and three offices all marked with some degree of management. He found and ate condiment packets. Not one thing that once had food in it was safe from being licked clean. Out of desperation he has tried to set traps for bugs and rodents. The flesh was willing but he was a complete moron when it came to woodsy stuff. At first he thought being in a radio antennae would be cool, until he discovered there was no music to be had. It was a weather station broadcasting regional updates. In a desert! That had to be the most boring job. Probably almost as boring as sitting out here waiting to die. Rocking Rob lowers his head. Its been two weeks since had any food. he has been thinking about cutting flesh from his leg and maybe getting a couple more days off the calories. He wont do it though he will hold out hope. The air outside is filled with black snow. He was afraid to walk through the dark desert looking for rescue, but now it's too late. His hand trembles under the effort to squeeze the talk button on the microphone. He whispers, \"please,\" before the strength to leaves his body.

God damn it, is anyone out there, I need help. I am out of stuff, the vending machine is empty and the my sink filled with water, its all gone. If anyone can hear me I am at the antennae thing in the middle of the desert. God damn it help me! Rocking Rob was lucky, sort of. He was out in the desert doing peyote when the first bomb was dropped on what he could assume was Los Angeles and then some more dropped just South, possibly in San Diego and he eventually figured the glow to the East was Las Vegas. Its an odd sensation to watch the deaths millions of people thinking that it was the most beautiful thing he has ever seen. It was quite spectacular, would up vote, but now Rob may be the last person on Earth. But that's not going to last long, he is trapped hundred of miles from nowhere with no food and no water and nuclear rage fire happening all around him. Too start with Rob was n't a skinny dude. The amount of mass he dropped though in such a short amount of time was staggering. The contents of the vending machine did not last a week. It seemed the processed food just made him hungrier. When it was gone he emptied the fridge in the small kitchenette in the shack attached to the antennae. The shack had a dozen cubicles shoved into it, one sound booth and three offices all marked with some degree of management. He found and ate condiment packets. Not one thing that once had food in it was safe from being licked clean. Out of desperation he has tried to set traps for bugs and rodents. The flesh was willing but he was a complete moron when it came to woodsy stuff. At first he thought being in a radio antennae would be cool, until he discovered there was no music to be had. It was a weather station broadcasting regional updates. In a desert! That had to be the most boring job. Probably almost as boring as sitting out here waiting to die. Rocking Rob lowers his head. Its been two weeks since had any food. he has been thinking about cutting flesh from his leg and maybe getting a couple more days off the calories. He wont do it though he will hold out hope. The air outside is filled with black snow. He was afraid to walk through the dark desert looking for rescue, but now it's too late. His hand trembles under the effort to squeeze the talk button on the microphone. He whispers, \"please,\" before the strength to leaves his body. In terms of struggle Rob did not put up much of one and maybe the world is better off for it.\n\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about 500 words in length:\nSuyuan Woo's history of leaving her twin daughters in China is revealed.",
        "output": " She left them behind because she couldn't afford to bring them with her to America. Her husband didn't want to leave them either, so they stayed behind. Suyuan's mother-in-law took care of them while they were away. Suyuan felt guilty for leaving them, but she knew that she had to go to America to make money so that she could send for them later. She worked hard in America and saved every penny she could. Eventually, she was able to send for her daughters. They were happy to see their mother again, but they also missed their grandmother very much. Suyuan promised them that she would take them back to China someday so that they could see their grandmother again. And she kept her promise. She brought them back to China and reunited them with their grandmother. They were all very happy to be together again.\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about 500 words in length:\nThe man walked down the street, his hands in his pockets.",

Life turned from peace to chaos, happiness to misery. The constant stress, fighting, distrust and resentment slowly began to manifest into only one thing. Hatred. Love had turned into hatred. I had never mentioned Alicia to Clarice. I had always assumed she was like me, that she had left someone behind to be with me. Then one fine day it all made sense. All it took was one sentence from Clarice and it became crystal clear.

The Confederates receive the message and are shocked. They immediately prepare for battle. The next morning, the Union army attacks the Confederate army. The Confederates are caught off guard and are quickly defeated. The Union army celebrates their victory. Little do they know, the Confederates had already received the message and were prepared for the attack. The Confederates had actually won the battle. The Union army is surprised and confused. They don't understand how the Confederates could have known about the attack. They eventually realize that the pigeon had delivered the wrong message. The Union army is humiliated",

I was designated'historian' by my job title but that did n't mean anything. In reality I was just someone to make sure the systems did n't crash when multiple upgrades were scheduled. During a routine check on the upgrade status in the memory networks I noticed an error warning flagged for the autodiagnostic. The systems would be incapacitated for another few hours and the boredom of being the useless organic element had gotten to me. Using a personal input I synced to the memory's records. It took all of five minutes to realize that an entire year was missing. Figuring it was a location error I waited for the systems to restore. My AI-Component woke up as the rest of the systems came back to function. There was the familiar sense of its presence. There was my desync-anxiety being washed away by that presence. I spoke allowed the question: Where is 2016? As I asked the answer flickered immediately into my awareness. 2016 was nowhere because no such year had ever taken place. All recorded human history is fabricated. In order to save information space only certain years exist as detailed records whilst most have only notable events.

I knew that the city outside the Archive and the Archive itself were situational representations. I knew that the year was 12 and that no evidence of organic intelligence had ever been discovered. There was nothing on Earth remotely resembling human beings. I was just the system representing some part of itself to itself in the most efficient way it knew how. Despite they're non-existence the anxiolytics had the desired effect and soon the memory purge would expunge any recollection of remembering the truth.

I sent up a rocket to orbit the Earth, its only purpose to take photos of this beautiful planet. And as I thought they would be, the pictures were marvelous, a true reflection of the beauty of nature. Yet instead of awe, my mouth was open in shock. The image you have in your head is wrong. I saw the oceans, blue as ever and the continents floating on top. I saw the clouds, seemingly painted onto the surface. And if I squinted, I saw the mountain ranges, the seas, the islands, all humanity's residence. And yet, something was wrong. I did n't see the round sphere I expected to see. Instead I saw a planet, so familiar, yet so distant. I saw a flat Earth. I stared at the photos with a blank look on my face. How could this be real? The shape of the Earth is a scientific fact that we've known for centuries, and yet I held in my hands the evidence that changes all that. Have we been wrong this whole time? I sat down and tried to comprehend it all. I was in denial. I checked to see if somehow, there was something wrong with the picture, perhaps the computer had gotten the data wrong, perhaps it was sending faulty messages, perhaps someone was just messing with me. I held on to the tiny sliver of hope that I was wrong, that this was all just a big misunderstanding. But alas, I was right. Though the possibility that perhaps something was wrong lingered in the back of my mind, I knew that it was true. I stared up at the night sky, looking at the stars. Humans are very stubborn creatures. We refuse to believe we are ever wrong and when we do, we admit it with a sigh of disappointment instead of a smile, knowing that we've learned something new. We take it as a personal insult to our intelligence if we're wrong, thinking'we should've known.\" Thinking we're right is more important than being right. But I am a logical, rational human being. I ca n't let my emotions overcome me. Knowing the truth is infinitely more important than being right. And yet I find myself so hesitant to admit the mistakes of my predecessors. To admit that we will have to re-learn everything about the Earth. To admit that we will have to start again. To admit that humans are mere mortals. The thing about facts is that they're true whether you believe in them or not. But I can change that. I grabbed my lighter and lit the photos. I watched them burn up until they had turned into ash.

Perhaps he felt indebted to me since I would have been the master of the house and heir to the family fortunes should things have gone differently. Alas, I had been very young when the harsh disease of Rot Lung had ravaged my body. The disease that could kill full grown men had me lying in bed for months, coughing up blood and yellow phlegm. When the disease finally left my body it left it weak, my lungs wheezed with every breathe and my muscles were left thin and atrophied. If I was from a less affluent family I may have been left to die. Luckily for me, my family was not about to let their firstborn son die. They would also not allow me to show the family as weak, so I was locked away. My brother tells me that he fought for years to keep me as the heir to the family. He said that he argued until he was blue in the face that the Dracul blood was strong and that I would eventually recover. \"Just give him time\", he said, I would be able to take over the duties of master of the house given time. Sometimes I would show improvement, my family rejoiced and my dear brother returned from his travels abroad to help nurse me back to health once again. Unhappily my health never stayed long after the celebrations began. It was as if the mere presence of such joyful happiness poisoned my body. I would began to vomit and become bedridden again for cause of muscle spasms. Through this all my brother would nurse me, spoon feeding me his exotic medicines that he had collected on his travels late into the the night. Always hoping that one of them would finally cure me. Eventually my father had his way, my brother was to be the new head of the family. All of the Dracul land, titles, and riches were to go to him. My loving brother said that he begged father to wait just a little longer, to leave me some small smidgen of inheritance, but it was to no avail. My father died soon after naming my brother heir, before I was ever able to reconcile myself with him. With my father's death, Vladimir moved back home and began his duties as the head of house Dracul fully. Today I awoke feeling better than I had in a very long time. Perhaps I would leave my room and surprise Vlad with how my health, would n't he be so happy? I had not been into the upper chambers since my father had been alive and I had been being groomed for eventual lordship of our house but I still remembered the way, I still remembered the correct way to unlock the siege door. A door intended to seal away an entire wing of the castle.

The dawn of a new day, when humans thought to sneak up on the Deep Woods Dragon while it slept. It feared the way the sun reflected off of it' s scales, they said. It' s prismatic hide was so bright it was blinding. If taunted into the sun, they said, the Deep Woods Dragon could be defeated by the least trained of knights. The Deep Woods Dragon needed to be blinded, they said, or it would burn its attackers to ashes with rainbow-hued flames. He knew these rumors because the butterflies had told him. They were drawn to the rainbow of greens, yellows, pinks and purples of his scales, like the flowers they coveted so much. They had told him this, too, but the Dragon did not mind. The butterflies were honest, as their lives were short and beautiful. Even still, they could fly unhindered among the humans, even admired by the small humans who chased them, laughing. They told him stories while they rested on his wingtips, tail, and snout. Butterflies did not fear the Dragon, because they knew the truth. With a yawn, the Dragon shifted its weight to better perch itself on the tree' s stout branch. This tree was taller than the others, and overlooked a small, circular clearing. Without the deer, the weeds thrived, covering the dirt in a green, tangled mass. At the edge of the clearing stood a massive cave entrance, vines draped over the sides of smooth rock. The Dragon had snapped off the vines in front of the entrance, to give the illusion of occupancy. This was, after all, where the humans thought he lived. He knew these rumors because the butterflies had told him. \"In an ancient cave in the middle of the wood, lives an ancient dragon who' s up to no good!\" That was what the small humans like to chant as they chased the butterflies and laughed. So the Dragon tore at the vines, and scared the graceful deer from the peaceful clearing. He had enjoyed watching the deer with their young as they grazed the clearing. From up above in his favorite tree, they could not see him, and they could not fear him. Three times a day, the Dragon glided down from his tree to the old cave' s opening. There, he took a deep breath and screamed as loud as he could. He cried in both low tones and high pitches. He wailed in imitation of female humans, shouted in a voice mimicking angry male humans. The Dragon stood on top of the cave and breathed eye-searing beams of light from his mouth to the sky. It scared the birds huddled in the trees, and the noises scared the deer far from the clearing. But they also scared the humans away from the Deep Woods. He knew these rumors because the butterflies had told him. So he made his noises, made the lights, and scared the humans away. Because any humans who saw the Dragon would discover the truth. Because, when the Dragon stepped into the sunlight, they' d see how small he really was.

Pearl has never believed in the Kitchen God, but she keeps him anyway because he reminds her of Auntie Du. One night, Pearl wakes up to the sound of the Kitchen God crying. He tells her that he can't report to the Jade Emperor because he doesn't know anything about the household. Pearl decides to help him learn everything he needs to know. She teaches him how to cook, clean, and take care of the house. But when the time comes for the Kitchen God to report to the Jade Emperor, he still doesn't know enough.

When Amir's father decides to send him away to boarding school, Amir is relieved to finally be free of Hassan. However, after Amir returns home years later, he realizes that he has made a terrible mistake by abandoning his friend. He tries to make amends by helping Hassan's family, but it is too late. Hassan has already died, and Amir feels guilty for not being there for him when he needed him most.\n\nThe next day, Amir goes to visit Hassan's grave.

Never once had experienced trouble in my task as I had even had to pluck sweet children from the arms of their mothers. However, it all changed when I was tasked with taking the soul of David Mckiny. I watched David from the day he entered the Earth, and never before had I seen someone as special as him. He always thought of others first, always trying to help others before even contemplating his own commodities. I approached him on the fateful day at exactly noon. He was old now, no longer in his prime as he was finally about to lose his battle with cancer. I approached him as the hourglass emptied completely to the bottom. I spoke to him,\" David you must know who I am at this hour.\" He answered not necessarily speaking to me,\" If only I had helped more.... If only I could have have had more time! How dreadful to go when so many more need help!\" At this moment I found it immensely hard to fulfill my task. I was not met with a man begging for more time only to waste it on fruitless trivialities. I was met with a man who wanted to bring grace to more people. He wished not to make his life better, but only cares to try to improve as many others as possible. I finally brought myself to say,\" David you have been a good man, but death is one thing which is inevitable, and not even I can grant time when someone is due. You must come along now with me.\" He allowed his soul to leave his body, a tear running down his face as he did. I extended my arm to him and he obliged.

I saw, as we walked, countless people who David had helped, most of which he had n't known and would never see again. Every part of me wished to guide him back to his body, but I knew I had a task to fulfill, and I knew I had to complete it. After a long while of walking down the path, we finally came to the gateway where David would continue without my guidance. I never know where the person will go once they enter, but I knew David would go to a place that would have the same passion in death as he did in life. I never had such a hard time seeing someone move on, and I sat a while thinking of how tragic it is for someone like David, genuinely the best kind of person, to be taken from such a cruel world when he one of the few people who deserved to stay.

I take a quick scan of the train, watching the stream of grey individuals start to fill the empty spaces and I smile pleasantly as a man sits next to me. He smiles back, but a little uncertain, he takes another look at my direction and says \"dude, why is your shirt bright, and I mean bright, pink\". Looking down at my grey shirt I sigh, I asked the lady at the store where I bought it, if it looked nice on me and was n't too bright. I'm sure it wo n't be the last joke someone will play on me. Indulging the stranger I quickly explain that my life is devoid of colour and to me everything looks grey. He frowns at my answer, \"are n't you really sad? it's depressing to have everything grey\" \"I do n't think so\" I respond, \"I've been this way my whole life, to me, it's normal. Hours pass and it's finally lunch time, I'm sitting in my usual cafe eating my usual sandwich when she walks in. My eye's are drawn to this beautiful women, she stands out from everyone, because she is not grey. I do n't know how to calm my mind, her dress is so bright it almost hurt's, her hair is darker then the dress but still far richer then anything that surrounds her. She looks at me and smiles, her teeth blind and her eye's are like bright spears that impale my soul. I heard the cashier make a off hand remark about her new green dress and I almost lose it. How can she be so calm and casual when talking about this colour green, her dress lights up my whole world and I felt a tear roll down my cheek. I know I ca n't wait, I ca n't live without this women, I need her colour. Getting up I make my way over, \"excuse me, miss, you are the most beautiful women in the whole world, nothing I have ever seen is close to what you are to me\" She smiles, but it does n't reach her eye's and my heart sinks. She makes some comment about her being flattered but she is already taken, grabs her coffee and goes. I'm now traveling home, and I watch the grey world pass by the window, I watch the blur of grey become one band of colour until I refocus my eye's. I walk home and enter my grey house and lay on my grey bed and all I can think of is that girl, who is she, where does she go, how can I get close to her, how can I keep her around me forever.

I take a quick scan of the train, watching the stream of grey individuals start to fill the empty spaces and I smile pleasantly as a man sits next to me. He smiles back, but a little uncertain, he takes another look at my direction and says \"dude, why is your shirt bright, and I mean bright, pink\". Looking down at my grey shirt I sigh, I asked the lady at the store where I bought it, if it looked nice on me and was n't too bright. I'm sure it wo n't be the last joke someone will play on me. Indulging the stranger I quickly explain that my life is devoid of colour and to me everything looks grey. He frowns at my answer, \"are n't you really sad? it's depressing to have everything grey\" \"I do n't think so\" I respond, \"I've been this way my whole life, to me, it's normal.

She knows she should play, but she just can't bring herself to do it. The silence is deafening. Suddenly, there's a knock at the door. It's the mailman, delivering a package for Ronnie. She opens it eagerly, hoping it's something exciting. But instead, she finds a letter from her old music teacher. The letter is full of praise for Ronnie's talent, and it encourages her to pick up the piano again. Ronnie reads the letter several times, trying to absorb its message.

He regrets not spending more time with his family, not being a better father, and not taking care of himself. He also feels guilty for all the pain he caused others. Just before the switch is thrown, Jefferson says one final prayer. He asks God to forgive him for his sins and to give him peace. Then, the switch is thrown, and Jefferson is dead. His body is cremated, and his ashes are spread across the ocean. Jefferson's death brings closure to his family and friends.

It was a feeling I had never felt before it was like everything that was wrong was suddenly right. She didn' t care for me at first but after several attempts she finally agreed to go out with me. The following were the best months of my life. I lived in an extreme state of happiness and pleasure. Everything that was once mundane was now exciting and fresh, I had never enjoyed walks on the beach or being aroused by a simple touch of her hand. One day she fell ill. The doctors tried everything but nothing seemed to work. Her deep blue eyes were tired and lacked the light that once captivate me. It was devastating to see her in a hospital bed waiting for her life to end. All I wanted was to be with her until the end. It was then that I took action. I read all the books.I knew how it worked but I had never done it. I never had a reason to do it. I bought the roses, the lambs heart, and I captured the laugh of a child. It was a simple ritual it will take one year of life to give her one more day of life. I lit the candles, prayed the mantras, poured my blood over the white roses, stuffed the lamb with the roses and released the laugh of the child. I didn' t feel any change at the moment but the next day I noticed small wrinkles in my face. I did the ritual every night until my hair was covered in grays.

It was a feeling I had never felt before it was like everything that was wrong was suddenly right. She didn' t care for me at first but after several attempts she finally agreed to go out with me. The following were the best months of my life. I lived in an extreme state of happiness and pleasure. Everything that was once mundane was now exciting and fresh, I had never enjoyed walks on the beach or being aroused by a simple touch of her hand. One day she fell ill. The doctors tried everything but nothing seemed to work. Her deep blue eyes were tired and lacked the light that once captivate me. It was devastating to see her in a hospital bed waiting for her life to end. All I wanted was to be with her until the end. It was then that I took action. I read all the books.I knew how it worked but I had never done it. I never had a reason to do it. I bought the roses, the lambs heart, and I captured the laugh of a child. It was a simple ritual it will take one year of life to give her one more day of life. I lit the candles, prayed the mantras, poured my blood over the white roses, stuffed the lamb with the roses and released the laugh of the child. I didn' t feel any change at the moment but the next day I noticed small wrinkles in my face. I did the ritual every night until my hair was covered in grays. She was not getting better but she had not worsen. She was just there, laying in that hospital bed with no pain and still as beautiful as the first day I saw her. As I kissed her goodnight she plead for me to stop. \"I am ready to go\" she whispered in my ear, \"it' s too much. You have given me three more wonderful weeks with you.

The road to salvation is a treacherous one, and the advice I give you may run counter to the actions of your peers, but do not fret. Firstly it is important that the patient become involved within his church, let him see that even the most faithful doubt, even the most chaste are tempted, and even the holiest among them sin. You must weed ideas within him that this is acceptable. Remind him that he is naught but a flawed human and without the grace of god he is doomed to perish. Secondly is his works. Encourage the patient at all turns to minister. Let him minister to the poor, to remind him that all of the enemy's children still want. Let him minister to the sick to remind him that the enemy's children still despair. Let him do all these things selflessly, a shining paragon of virtue, so others may look upon him and marvel at his deeds. When he is asked why he performs these things what shall he tell them? \"It is God's will\"? No, I say. He should reply that he does them from the love within his own heart, and should he be pressed only then will he reveal that it is God's love that shines through him. Let him lead by example, dear Wormwood, and not by decree or doctrine, for humans are foolish and prefer the words of a hypocrite over the actions of a saint. I tell you that the patient should not pass judgement, or if he must, he should not condemn, but offer forgiveness. For this way the patient will be led most astray, by showing grace instead of wrath those around him will be free to sin again, but also take care that the patient not be weak to those who sin against him. Model the patients behavior to mimic the enemy, justice tempered with mercy, so sins of actions are stopped and sins of the heart may heal. Should the patient face danger give him courage, should the patient face adversity give him perseverance, and above all never let him forget the love of the enemy, so that upon his road to damnation he is given some measure of comfort.

She also wants him to be able to defend himself against the white men who are always harassing him. Grant agrees to do this because he feels sorry for Jefferson and thinks that he deserves better than what he has. He starts by teaching Jefferson how to read and write, and then moves on to teaching him how to fight. Jefferson is a quick learner and soon becomes quite skilled at both reading and fighting. However, he is still very shy and timid around women, which makes Miss Emma sad. One day, while they are walking home from school, Jefferson sees a group of white men harassing a black woman. He immediately jumps into action and fights them off, saving the woman from being raped. This act of bravery impresses everyone, including Miss Emma, who is now proud of Jefferson and happy that he has become such a strong and capable man.\n",

Contemplating my life as it were. So many memories I wanted to share with you. Diamonds for my one true love. Do you remember that one cool summer evening half a lifetime ago? We nestled ourselves against each other on the blanket in the park. I can still feel your skin against mine as we watched the fireworks together. Your chestnut hair stroking my cheek and ear as you rested your head on my shoulder. I could n't believe you were gone. Day turned into night. Food tasted like nothing. The world turned into a bland grey color. I could n't believe it. I did n't want to believe it. I wept and kept weeping. Then I had no tears left to sob. I lost weight. I lost my hair. I gained wrinkles. When I lost you, the man in the mirror showed me his true age almost overnight. But then things started to change. Our Elisabeth. Our loving, kind Lillibeth who moved half a world for her Australian. She visited me eventually. We talked about you, Lily. We shared a thousand little things between us. A flock of starlings composing your life. During that visit, the turmoil caused by losing you finally seemed to settle. At the end, I decided to finally change my Facebook status. Lillibeth helped me. You know my old, bony fingers have gotten a mind of their own, it seems. I wanted to tell you, Lilly, that I got a little surprise the very next day. This tabby kitten sat outside our garden door the very next morning. It seemed lost, but her eyes betrayed she knew exactly were she was. As I opened the door, she jumped right in and installed herself in the spot on the couch from where you used to watch the telly during long winter evenings. I decided to dub her Lilly because she seems to have a playful streak. Just like you. And most importantly, she seemed to be the antidote to my loneliness. That's not the end of it. Lily was only the first. Each week, I woke up to find two or three feline friends at our garden door. I let them, fed them and started to call them by a name I gave them. Each of them seemingly knowing that she belonged in this house. There's Athena who sits on your sewing machine, looking wise beyond her years. There's Hera who likes to wake me up each morning, and has this stern and down-to-earth disposition. There's Hebe, she's just a kitten who seems to have no bounds teasing the others. All in all, there's twelve of them who came to live with me. They keep me company. Follow me through the house as I go about my day. When I see them, they always remind me of a part of you. An aspect that I should n't forget. Sometimes they're mere presence helps me as the practicalities in life start to fade from my memory. When I spot Demeter sitting in front of the fridge, it hits me that I still need to do the groceries. Oh Lily, I miss you so much. My life has entered the twilight years. Only so much time is left before I will join you. I hope our Lillibeth will take care of my twelve feline companions. She'll be most delighted recognising some aspect of her mother in each of them. Yours forever with endless love, Werner.\n\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about 500 words in length:\nPi grows up in a zoo in India."

While they are filling up, a tiger jumps out of the bushes and attacks the car. Pi's parents are killed, but he manages to escape. He runs into the woods and hides in a tree. The tiger follows him and tries to climb the tree, but Pi is able to scare it away. He spends the night in the tree and the next day he finds a boat. He gets in and starts sailing across the ocean. He is alone for months until he meets another shipwrecked sailor. They become friends and help each other survive. Eventually, they reach land and are rescued.

The clouds on the walls were suddenly blocked by a horde of scrambling young bodies and flailing limbs. I froze, the hat on my head tilted just enough for me to see everything, and i saw fear. Andy stood there in the middle of the floor, clutching the dreaded spaceman box, but that seemed to matter less compared to the pressing matter. The air was still, I could feel Mr.Potato head's round eyes blink and the sound of heavy breathing from the guests penetrated the silence with jagged blades of uncertainty. I considered freezing, but it was too late. We all knew it. Rex panicked like a child who came down christmas morning to find no gifts. He thundered across the hardwood floors for the window, yelling at the top of his lungs some inaudible dinosaur screech. I spun around, knowing it was too late and pointed towards the window. The toys did n't need a second prompt. The strong man and Mr. Potato head grabbed the monkeys in a barrel, hopped in RC and gunned the engines. The army men attempted to rescue some of the less mobile toys, but it was too late. One brilliant child had the idea to grab my waist with his sweaty, greasy hand and hold me up in the air. I put up a fight, hoping to distract them enough to let everyone escape. I did n't know what would happen, but panic had overrun my emotions and pure terror coursed through my plastic veins. But then, salvation. Andy wrenched me from the child's grasp and shouted angrily \"YOU ONLY GOT ME BEDSHEETS.\" He held me gently in his grasp and managed to utter \"Woody?\" I stared back up at him with and sorrow filled my soul. I knew this was it, the other toys were out. \"I'm sorry Andy, you'll understand one day.\" I flung my sack cloth limbs out of his hand and towards the bed, hitting it with surprising force. I propelled myself towards the window, clear through the slit. The other toys were already at the edge of the law waiting for me, but I had to look back at least once. Andy stared out the window with a look of pure despair on his face and one confused spaceman peered back, blinking quizzically towards the small group of toys, running down the street; never to return.\n\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about 500 words in length:\nPi's father shows him the danger of animals by feeding a goat to a tiger."

Looking back I realize I was naive, or maybe I was too full of hope. Me and Maria created the nano bots for constuction, as a way to ease the burden of building the lunar colony. She had survived the imperial invasion in the ruins of Los Angeles, she thought she could create a brighter future. Selfishness, that's what undid everything. Eventually the colonists decided they could n't abide the laws of earth. The people of earth decided they would n't abide rebels on the moon. They could n't accept those resources would be used for something other than their gain. So I reprogrammed the bots, I did n't tell her, how could I? They were meant to break things down and rebuild faults in the domes, I just allowed them to accept new targets. Of course she figured it out. With Maria gone I wanted to die, but I could n't. She dreamed of a world without conflict, where everyone had enough. I knew they would n't come willingly, so I lied. I told them I could make the bots fix the domes; that everything would be alright. Instead I joined my mind with them. At first I was in control. They tried to stop me, but the bots ate whatever they sent to harm me. I created massive pylon factories across the globe preparing for their acsension. I was lazy, a single mistake doomed everything. I set my neural pattern as the administrator. The others where sublimated within me. What else could I do, I had to quiet their voices or be driven mad. That was when the machines decided to best safeguard my well being they had to take over several key roles. What we needed most was matter, for fuel and to rebuild lost bots. We became a swarm. We devoured the earth in minutes. And so we drifted, eating always eating. We found the hive ships, sent centuries before my birth. We ate evrrything, and added the humans to the databanks. I saw nebulae beyond comprehension, their beauty cut down by their hunger. The only hope I had left was to leave beacons containing copies of my mind.

Looking back I realize I was naive, or maybe I was too full of hope. Me and Maria created the nano bots for constuction, as a way to ease the burden of building the lunar colony. She had survived the imperial invasion in the ruins of Los Angeles, she thought she could create a brighter future. Selfishness, that's what undid everything. Eventually the colonists decided they could n't abide the laws of earth. The people of earth decided they would n't abide rebels on the moon. They could n't accept those resources would be used for something other than their gain. So I reprogrammed the bots, I did n't tell her, how could I? They were meant to break things down and rebuild faults in the domes, I just allowed them to accept new targets. Of course she figured it out. With Maria gone I wanted to die, but I could n't. She dreamed of a world without conflict, where everyone had enough. I knew they would n't come willingly, so I lied. I told them I could make the bots fix the domes; that everything would be alright. Instead I joined my mind with them. At first I was in control. They tried to stop me, but the bots ate whatever they sent to harm me. I created massive pylon factories across the globe preparing for their acsension. I was lazy, a single mistake doomed everything. I set my neural pattern as the administrator. The others where sublimated within me. What else could I do, I had to quiet their voices or be driven mad. That was when the machines decided to best safeguard my well being they had to take over several key roles. What we needed most was matter, for fuel and to rebuild lost bots. We became a swarm. We devoured the earth in minutes. And so we drifted, eating always eating. We found the hive ships, sent centuries before my birth. We ate evrrything, and added the humans to the databanks. I saw nebulae beyond comprehension, their beauty cut down by their hunger. The only hope I had left was to leave beacons containing copies of my mind. Perhaps someone could find them, and destroy the swarm. We encountered aliens with fantastical technology, they attacked me with lasers that could cut through time itself. Still we fed. Stars were broken down bit by bit to fulfill our needs. Millenia passed and the feasts became further and further apart. With the lack of resources came concessions.

Soon enough immortal children grew up and became scientists or participants in studies. They maintained the appearance of a child but had the brain of any other. And after several decades more immortal humans were everywhere, but humanity could n't discover how to replicate the genes or mutations causing the phenomena. It's now over one hundred fifty years since the birth of the first immortal. A young looking girl named Esther sat in a grassy field. Trees skirted the field at her back and in front of her sat a city. She'd seen more in her lifetime than any other human ever had. Several wars, booms in technology so astonishing that soon enough scientists said we were going to be making contact with celestial bodies outside of the solar system, and last of all the introduction of a drug you could take that would change every strand of your DNA. The age at which you took it would be the age you appeared to be for the rest of your life. She had a passion for spreading her gift around so others would n't experience the burdens and pains of aging. But the side effects of the drug did n't manifest for years, sometimes decades.

The population of true immortals was still growing and the population of the population of mortals and mortal turned immortals remained about the same. Groups of mortals rose up trying to keep their way of life going, but many wished for them to give up so humanity could be purified of death. Was it cruel to bring a mortal to life in the world of immortals? Immortals ruled the world and they certainly thought so. After the discovery that the drug had severe negative side effects the immortals wished to ban it as well, and so they did. It was illegal to produce it, sell it, possess it, and above all, illegal to have a child after having taken the drug. Esther had left her lab years early. She had given up on finding why they could n't fix the drug or reverse its effects. She moved out to the country, wishing she had never discovered it. The country was an expensive place to live due to the enormous population size humanity had reached, but she had more money than she would ever need.

It' s prismatic hide was so bright it was blinding. If taunted into the sun, they said, the Deep Woods Dragon could be defeated by the least trained of knights. The Deep Woods Dragon needed to be blinded, they said, or it would burn its attackers to ashes with rainbow-hued flames. He knew these rumors because the butterflies had told him. They were drawn to the rainbow of greens, yellows, pinks and purples of his scales, like the flowers they coveted so much. They had told him this, too, but the Dragon did not mind. The butterflies were honest, as their lives were short and beautiful. Even still, they could fly unhindered among the humans, even admired by the small humans who chased them, laughing. They told him stories while they rested on his wingtips, tail, and snout. Butterflies did not fear the Dragon, because they knew the truth. With a yawn, the Dragon shifted its weight to better perch itself on the tree' s stout branch. This tree was taller than the others, and overlooked a small, circular clearing. Without the deer, the weeds thrived, covering the dirt in a green, tangled mass. At the edge of the clearing stood a massive cave entrance, vines draped over the sides of smooth rock. The Dragon had snapped off the vines in front of the entrance, to give the illusion of occupancy. This was, after all, where the humans thought he lived. He knew these rumors because the butterflies had told him. \"In an ancient cave in the middle of the wood, lives an ancient dragon who' s up to no good!\" That was what the small humans like to chant as they chased the butterflies and laughed. So the Dragon tore at the vines, and scared the graceful deer from the peaceful clearing. He had enjoyed watching the deer with their young as they grazed the clearing. From up above in his favorite tree, they could not see him, and they could not fear him. Three times a day, the Dragon glided down from his tree to the old cave' s opening. There, he took a deep breath and screamed as loud as he could. He cried in both low tones and high pitches. He wailed in imitation of female humans, shouted in a voice mimicking angry male humans. The Dragon stood on top of the cave and breathed eye-searing beams of light from his mouth to the sky. It scared the birds huddled in the trees, and the noises scared the deer far from the clearing. But they also scared the humans away from the Deep Woods. He knew these rumors because the butterflies had told him. So he made his noises, made the lights, and scared the humans away. Because any humans who saw the Dragon would discover the truth. Because, when the Dragon stepped into the sunlight, they' d see how small he really was. The Deep Woods Dragon, with prismatic scales that shone in the sun and such a frightening voice, was the size of a domestic house cat.

The Dragon stood on top of the cave and breathed eye-searing beams of light from his mouth to the sky. It scared the birds huddled in the trees, and the noises scared the deer far from the clearing. But they also scared the humans away from the Deep Woods. He knew these rumors because the butterflies had told him. So he made his noises, made the lights, and scared the humans away. Because any humans who saw the Dragon would discover the truth. Because, when the Dragon stepped into the sunlight, they' d see how small he really was. The Deep Woods Dragon, with prismatic scales that shone in the sun and such a frightening voice, was the size of a domestic house cat. And only the butterflies knew the truth.\n\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about 500 words in length:\nJoe Christmas is accused of murdering Joanna Burden.",

Our planet, along with its some 7.8 billion population of people, have been forced to hide, or die trying. Many of us went underground, taking with us seeds and other animals to restart life if possible. We all new the odds of that though. After the first five years of preparation, we went into cryostasis, while a small population elected to stay and try and plot our course through the lonely emptiness of deep space. Needless to say, they succeeded, and they were bloody excited. Our Earth, with its surface now a comfortable -176 degrees Celsius, is on a hopeful course to the Andromeda Galaxy. We are approaching it very fast, but we believe that we will come within orbital distance and speed of at least twenty stars. And so we were awoken. Our planet, after a century of darkness, is starting to receive light from nearby stars. The boffs say that it still is only a full moon of light, but it's a change. Soon, we will pass by a red giant, and very closely. The boffs believe that it will be enough to start thawing out our cold, icy blue planet. The day has arrived. I am standing at the airlock, alongside my expeditionary unit.

Everyone of them has lost something to the darkness, and everyone of them has determination to reclaim our planet and our lives. The air lock breaks, and a flood of air escapes and pours in.

Everything that was once mundane was now exciting and fresh, I had never enjoyed walks on the beach or being aroused by a simple touch of her hand. One day she fell ill.

It was devastating to see her in a hospital bed waiting for her life to end. All I wanted was to be with her until the end. It was then that I took action. I read all the books.I knew how it worked but I had never done it. I never had a reason to do it. I bought the roses, the lambs heart, and I captured the laugh of a child. It was a simple ritual it will take one year of life to give her one more day of life. I lit the candles, prayed the mantras, poured my blood over the white roses, stuffed the lamb with the roses and released the laugh of the child. I didn' t feel any change at the moment but the next day I noticed small wrinkles in my face. I did the ritual every night until my hair was covered in grays.

Let me go.\" But I couldn' t. How dare she ask me to let her go, to let everything we have built together vanish with her absence? I had never loved someone so much I could never let her go. I had never been so angry with her, with life, with the world. That was the night I took my first life. This time it took no ritual just a blade to the heart. Poor man never saw it coming, one moment he was peacefully sleeping on an alley and the next one he was granting me one more year of life, one more day in her life. I did n't like taking a life but I would do anything for her. One day while I payed her a visit I lost all sense of me. I woke up two days later in a hospital bed. I panicked.

There, they see the house. \"It's just as I saw it!\" exclaims Ishmael. \"Let's go inside and see if there's any food.\" The group enters the house and finds a table full of food. \"This is amazing!\" says one of the friends. \"We must have found the",

They climb up through a manhole cover and emerge onto the streets of New York City. They are shocked to see how different the world above ground looks compared to the dark, damp tunnels below. They quickly realize that they need to find shelter and food. They wander around the city, trying to stay hidden from the authorities who are looking for them. They eventually come across an abandoned building and decide to make it their home. They set up camp inside, making sure to keep the door locked so that no one can get in. They spend their days scavenging for food and water, and their nights huddled together for warmth. They start to feel safe and secure in their new home, but they know that they cannot stay there forever. They must find a way to escape the city and return to their old lives. They hatch a",

Our planet, along with its some 7.8 billion population of people, have been forced to hide, or die trying. Many of us went underground, taking with us seeds and other animals to restart life if possible. We all new the odds of that though. After the first five years of preparation, we went into cryostasis, while a small population elected to stay and try and plot our course through the lonely emptiness of deep space. Needless to say, they succeeded, and they were bloody excited. Our Earth, with its surface now a comfortable -176 degrees Celsius, is on a hopeful course to the Andromeda Galaxy. We are approaching it very fast, but we believe that we will come within orbital distance and speed of at least twenty stars. And so we were awoken. Our planet, after a century of darkness, is starting to receive light from nearby stars. The boffs say that it still is only a full moon of light, but it's a change. Soon, we will pass by a red giant, and very closely. The boffs believe that it will be enough to start thawing out our cold, icy blue planet. The day has arrived. I am standing at the airlock, alongside my expeditionary unit. It's been a few days since we started our slingshot around the red giant, and the surface readings say that the temperature is stabilizing between -19 and 2 degrees. It's still cold, but it will be bearable, especially in our survival gear. We have packed 3 days of food. It's been a while since I've had a military ration pack, but the management thought it would be suitable to have one with our return to the surface. Everyone else has backed skis on their backpacks, but I've got my old snowboard kit with me. It was my passion before I left the surface. I stand here, before the airlock, googles on and pretty much looking like a... Like one of those puffy treats you roast on a stick over fire. I ca n't remember their name. Come to think of it, I hardly remember what fire looks like. The attendant starts the opening sequence from his enclosed booth. I stand at the head of the other 11 men and women. Everyone of them has lost something to the darkness, and everyone of them has determination to reclaim our planet and our lives. The air lock breaks, and a flood of air escapes and pours in. As I shield my eyes from the initial blinding light, I know of the struggle to come. I stand upright, and stare out beyond the layered steel frame.

When you live for hundreds of years, you learn to spot the evil as easily as anyone else can spot a grotesque scar marring a person's face. I notice every time a child glances fearfully at her father, and I know what it means. When a man ca n't look his wife in the eye, I know what it is she's done. When a stranger holds his stare just a little too long at a passing woman, I know his plans. These clues, invisible to most, have made my job so much easier. The first time, it was hard. I was unsure, I hesitated. I remember it well, even if most others have faded into each other in my memory. The year was 1692, and I had spent the first eleven months following around a man who had killed and tortured people to further himself, and he showed no remorse for it. But I was young, just twenty-five, and I still clung to my morals of \"only god may judge.\". I watched him sleep for just a minute too long and I lost my nerve. As I turned around to leave, something hard caught me on the back of the head, and the dim candle light faded away, my thoughts disappearing with it. I woke with a start and tried to draw a breath, but my lungs were met with an ice cold burn that gave me no air. Everything around me felt heavy, and I struggled to open my eyes. With terror, I realized I was under water. I may have been immortal, but I was not immune to the pain of drowning. I tried to reach out, to swim away, but a cloth surrounded me. I struggled to pull out my knife, trying not to gasp in any more water to feed the fire engulfing my lungs. After what seemed like hours, I managed to slice through the sack that held me at the bottom, and I kicked my numbed legs as hard as I could. The sunlight was blinding when I finally broke the surface and pulled myself to shore, sputtering out the ice cold water and collapsing on the frozen ground. I sat there shivering, waiting for the the sun to come warm me, or the burning in my lungs to subside, but neither did. I stood up and took in my surroundings, I had been at the bottom of the man's lake, and his manor, filled with his ill gotten wealth, sat before me. I knew I could play no games this time. I walked the grand steps to the front door and began pounding, my clothes showering the ground with shards of ice. The servant who opened the door was speechless at my appearance, he knew me for what I was and had no intention of interfering. I strode past him and down a long corridor towards the man's chambers, my knife gripped in my still frozen hand. God would not have given me this power if he did n't want me to use it. I would not count on surprises today, he would face the death he deserved.\n\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about 500 words in length:\nHe becomes a killing machine capable of horrible violence."

I notice every time a child glances fearfully at her father, and I know what it means. When a man ca n't look his wife in the eye, I know what it is she's done. When a stranger holds his stare just a little too long at a passing woman, I know his plans. These clues, invisible to most, have made my job so much easier. The first time, it was hard. I was unsure, I hesitated. I remember it well, even if most others have faded into each other in my memory. The year was 1692, and I had spent the first eleven months following around a man who had killed and tortured people to further himself, and he showed no remorse for it. But I was young, just twenty-five, and I still clung to my morals of \"only god may judge.\". I watched him sleep for just a minute too long and I lost my nerve. As I turned around to leave, something hard caught me on the back of the head, and the dim candle light faded away, my thoughts disappearing with it. I woke with a start and tried to draw a breath, but my lungs were met with an ice cold burn that gave me no air. Everything around me felt heavy, and I struggled to open my eyes. With terror, I realized I was under water. I may have been immortal, but I was not immune to the pain of drowning. I tried to reach out, to swim away, but a cloth surrounded me. I struggled to pull out my knife, trying not to gasp in any more water to feed the fire engulfing my lungs. After what seemed like hours, I managed to slice through the sack that held me at the bottom, and I kicked my numbed legs as hard as I could. The sunlight was blinding when I finally broke the surface and pulled myself to shore, sputtering out the ice cold water and collapsing on the frozen ground. I sat there shivering, waiting for the the sun to come warm me, or the burning in my lungs to subside, but neither did. I stood up and took in my surroundings, I had been at the bottom of the man's lake, and his manor, filled with his ill gotten wealth, sat before me. I knew I could play no games this time. I walked the grand steps to the front door and began pounding, my clothes showering the ground with shards of ice. The servant who opened the door was speechless at my appearance, he knew me for what I was and had no intention of interfering. I strode past him and down a long corridor towards the man's chambers, my knife gripped in my still frozen hand. God would not have given me this power if he did n't want me to use it. I would not count on surprises today, he would face the death he deserved.\n\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about 500 words in length:\nHe becomes a killing machine capable of horrible violence.",

He watches videos online of people hunting and learns new tricks. Jack even starts practicing shooting targets in his backyard.\n\nOne day, Jack decides to go on a real hunt. He packs his gear and heads into the woods. As he walks through the forest, he sees a deer grazing in the distance. Jack takes aim and shoots the deer dead. He feels a rush of adrenaline as he realizes he has killed something for the first time.\n\nOver the next few months, Jack continues to hunt more and more often. He becomes skilled at tracking prey and stalking them until they are within range. He also develops a taste for blood and begins to enjoy the thrill of the kill.\n\nAs Jack's obsession grows, so does his desire to take bigger and bolder prey.

I did n't want my cells to age super-fast, or my mind to gradually decay into noise data. But those were n't the issue. What I should have paid attention to was resolution. It started on the fifth \"respawn\". Everything had been going fine up to then - incurable disease, radiation burns, blunt force trauma, blood loss. Horribly dead, safely alive, rinse, repeat. Then I noticed something odd. It was n't immediately noticeable. It might have been happening in previous lives, in even less conspicuous ways, but I found it on my nose. A voxel. It was disconcerting, but not terribly so. A little extra skin and an odd right-angle was n't something to make me question my latest biological vehicle, but I did wonder what would happen if it had happened in, say, my eye. A bullet through the head and I was back in the machine. After the standard checks, I tried to find a superficial voxel somewhere. This time it was a whole cube of extra skin on my upper arm, a few millimeters across. Now I started wondering if voxels could go missing instead of being added - and I started wondering if they could be missing internally. The tests continued. This time I was dropped unceremoniously into a small vat of fluoroantimonic acid - I barely had time to register pain before I chemically ceased to exist. When I woke up, voxels were the first thing I checked for. Nothing on my face, or my arms... But on my side there was a large raised spot, with right-angled edges. But there was little time to worry about my volumetric resolution - the next test was explosive. Alive again, I looked for voxellation. To my growing concern, it was spreading. Like square tumors, the voxels showed up in patches on my arms, legs, and torso. I hoped they would n't reach my... Higher-resolution areas. After the decompression test, the voxels were in all sorts of places. I started to feel like a combination of human and LEGO. They were n't impeding me in any way, but it was bizarre having irregular rectangular growths all over. They were pretty obvious from even a glance, but the tests continued. Death by rapid incineration. Voxels on my shins. Death by a laser through the heart. Voxels on my back. Death by electrocution. Voxels on my shoulders. I was still functioning perfectly - the voxels did n't seem to be happening to anything inside me. After a while I got used to them - I formed a habit of checking where my voxel patches had randomly generated with each \"respawn\". Eventually it had to happen. I awoke and found it mechanically difficult to extricate myself from the machine. A cursory examination revealed that my entire exterior surface was voxellated to a resolution of three millimeters. There was a fuss, and argument, and huddled discussion. Eventually someone noticed me standing around being extraordinarily Cartesian and told me to get back into the machine. It was just like dying - at least, like the particularly quick deaths. When I woke up, I had my contours back - you could say my resolution was molecular. It was refreshing not to have to worry about being compared to an old videogame.

Needless to say this would be considered the utmost setback, but fear not, dear Wormwood, for there is yet time to atone for your shortcomings. The road to salvation is a treacherous one, and the advice I give you may run counter to the actions of your peers, but do not fret. Firstly it is important that the patient become involved within his church, let him see that even the most faithful doubt, even the most chaste are tempted, and even the holiest among them sin. You must weed ideas within him that this is acceptable. Remind him that he is naught but a flawed human and without the grace of god he is doomed to perish. Secondly is his works. Encourage the patient at all turns to minister. Let him minister to the poor, to remind him that all of the enemy's children still want. Let him minister to the sick to remind him that the enemy's children still despair. Let him do all these things selflessly, a shining paragon of virtue, so others may look upon him and marvel at his deeds. When he is asked why he performs these things what shall he tell them? \"It is God's will\"? No, I say. He should reply that he does them from the love within his own heart, and should he be pressed only then will he reveal that it is God's love that shines through him. Let him lead by example, dear Wormwood, and not by decree or doctrine, for humans are foolish and prefer the words of a hypocrite over the actions of a saint. I tell you that the patient should not pass judgement, or if he must, he should not condemn, but offer forgiveness. For this way the patient will be led most astray, by showing grace instead of wrath those around him will be free to sin again, but also take care that the patient not be weak to those who sin against him. Model the patients behavior to mimic the enemy, justice tempered with mercy, so sins of actions are stopped and sins of the heart may heal. Should the patient face danger give him courage, should the patient face adversity give him perseverance, and above all never let him forget the love of the enemy, so that upon his road to damnation he is given some measure of comfort.

With the increase in average intelligence and decrease in disease, you would think that statistics would show an increase in personal happiness. This is not so. One day, we will learn to treat each other well, as fellow humans. I fear I will not live to see that day but I know it ca n't get worse than this, I hope.

Perhaps he felt indebted to me since I would have been the master of the house and heir to the family fortunes should things have gone differently. Alas, I had been very young when the harsh disease of Rot Lung had ravaged my body. The disease that could kill full grown men had me lying in bed for months, coughing up blood and yellow phlegm. When the disease finally left my body it left it weak, my lungs wheezed with every breathe and my muscles were left thin and atrophied. If I was from a less affluent family I may have been left to die. Luckily for me, my family was not about to let their firstborn son die. They would also not allow me to show the family as weak, so I was locked away. My brother tells me that he fought for years to keep me as the heir to the family. He said that he argued until he was blue in the face that the Dracul blood was strong and that I would eventually recover. \"Just give him time\", he said, I would be able to take over the duties of master of the house given time. Sometimes I would show improvement, my family rejoiced and my dear brother returned from his travels abroad to help nurse me back to health once again. Unhappily my health never stayed long after the celebrations began. It was as if the mere presence of such joyful happiness poisoned my body. I would began to vomit and become bedridden again for cause of muscle spasms. Through this all my brother would nurse me, spoon feeding me his exotic medicines that he had collected on his travels late into the the night. Always hoping that one of them would finally cure me. Eventually my father had his way, my brother was to be the new head of the family. All of the Dracul land, titles, and riches were to go to him. My loving brother said that he begged father to wait just a little longer, to leave me some small smidgen of inheritance, but it was to no avail. My father died soon after naming my brother heir, before I was ever able to reconcile myself with him. With my father's death, Vladimir moved back home and began his duties as the head of house Dracul fully. Today I awoke feeling better than I had in a very long time. Perhaps I would leave my room and surprise Vlad with how my health, would n't he be so happy? I had not been into the upper chambers since my father had been alive and I had been being groomed for eventual lordship of our house but I still remembered the way, I still remembered the correct way to unlock the siege door. A door intended to seal away an entire wing of the castle. Should the worst happen and the castle be invaded the siege door had the ability to lock and steal away the lord of the house, preserving our family's history and the life of anyone behind it long enough for help to arrive.

How can something fictional seem so vivid...? The distant, exotic land we came from, its gilded avenues, its glistening intricate spires, its profound natural beauty with lushly verdant banks hugging the rivers that snaked between the dunes. .. None of it was there. It was all nothing more than a dream. But I am not a lie. I stare at my hands, flexing them, examining the callouses accumulated by work never done, cracks formed of age never lived, and despite the warmth of the bright sun just passing its zenith above, I shiver. \"Amir,\" I hear a voice call, and my heart tugs at what I know to be familiarity. \"Hassan...?\" I uncertainly reply as I look up. Our gazes meet. I could swear I saw in his eyes the same false memories flashing behind mine. Childhood among parents who never lived, in a community that was never built, attending an academy that was never founded, graduating from a ceremony never held... He nods hollowly, as if to confirm these very musings. \"... We have to pack the supplies, Amir. His Majesty will be staying at the palace, and the staff are directing us to where we are to stow his wardrobe and leave his tributes to The Sultan.\" My mouth was dry, but not in response to his words. At some point I realized my'old friend' Hassan was talking only to fill the screaming void in our minds. To'Sound Normal', like'Real People'. My stomach is a knot of ice. Still, the skills of a life as-yet unlived surface readily to the forefront of my mind. How to port the many caskets of His Majesty Prince Ali's wares. \"... Yes. I will coordinate with the provisioner. If my memory serves,\" I pause a bit too long, lost in the jarring disjunction of citing false memories, \"... it is customary to serve a great feast with the arrival of a dignitary. The many delicacies of our homeland are sure to leave a resounding impression upon The Sultan's court.\" Hassan's expression tightens. I feel his heartache, for this homeland which we have never seen with real eyes, and never shall. He hesitantly takes a step nearer and dispenses a conciliatory pat to my shoulder. A mutual understanding. We were truly all feeling it, every last member of His Majesty Prince Ali's vanguard.... he was n't even really a prince. I shudder and turn, to address the court provisioner by name. He's just as haunted and startled as I that we know one another, but everything is running smoothly. We have no solace from our inner thoughts. We can only push on in the hopes that the minutia will wash away the horror.\n\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about 500 words in length:\nHe seeks advice from his editor, Shrike, who mocks him."

How can something fictional seem so vivid...? The distant, exotic land we came from, its gilded avenues, its glistening intricate spires, its profound natural beauty with lushly verdant banks hugging the rivers that snaked between the dunes. .. None of it was there. It was all nothing more than a dream. But I am not a lie. I stare at my hands, flexing them, examining the callouses accumulated by work never done, cracks formed of age never lived, and despite the warmth of the bright sun just passing its zenith above, I shiver. \"Amir,\" I hear a voice call, and my heart tugs at what I know to be familiarity. \"Hassan...?\" I uncertainly reply as I look up. Our gazes meet. I could swear I saw in his eyes the same false memories flashing behind mine. Childhood among parents who never lived, in a community that was never built, attending an academy that was never founded, graduating from a ceremony never held... He nods hollowly, as if to confirm these very musings. \"... We have to pack the supplies, Amir. His Majesty will be staying at the palace, and the staff are directing us to where we are to stow his wardrobe and leave his tributes to The Sultan.\" My mouth was dry, but not in response to his words. At some point I realized my'old friend' Hassan was talking only to fill the screaming void in our minds. To'Sound Normal', like'Real People'. My stomach is a knot of ice. Still, the skills of a life as-yet unlived surface readily to the forefront of my mind. How to port the many caskets of His Majesty Prince Ali's wares. \"... Yes. I will coordinate with the provisioner. If my memory serves,\" I pause a bit too long, lost in the jarring disjunction of citing false memories, \"... it is customary to serve a great feast with the arrival of a dignitary. The many delicacies of our homeland are sure to leave a resounding impression upon The Sultan's court.\" Hassan's expression tightens. I feel his heartache, for this homeland which we have never seen with real eyes, and never shall. He hesitantly takes a step nearer and dispenses a conciliatory pat to my shoulder. A mutual understanding. We were truly all feeling it, every last member of His Majesty Prince Ali's vanguard.... he was n't even really a prince. I shudder and turn, to address the court provisioner by name. He's just as haunted and startled as I that we know one another, but everything is running smoothly. We have no solace from our inner thoughts. We can only push on in the hopes that the minutia will wash away the horror.\n\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about 500 words in length:\nHe seeks advice from his editor, Shrike, who mocks him.",

The office towers lighting up in the evening haze and the smeary pale of a cloudless sunset. The tiny headlights of cars with sweaty passengers unseen, idling in traffic, smelling the hot food cooking in restaurants. The world shifts as the woman behind the camera adjusts her footing, muttering in English to her boyfriend. A light like the sun over the horizon, there and then gone. Silence, but for the wind in the trees. She asks what that was. The clean, shaved, washed, waxed people in suits at desks read facts and information like sports commentary. They narrate animations with moving arrows and lines like football plays. They report on characters and captains. They discuss. They debate. They nod solemnly. The light flashes in the sky and fades but the afterglow remains. They update, they check-in, they go-live, they re-Tweet. Wounded civilians scream and coddle loved ones, rewind. Look right here: loved ones die. Rewind. The light like the sun. Stay tuned. A city, its mountains. The office buildings lighting up in evening haze. Tiny headlights and unseen drivers thinking about food. A mutter in the sunset. A light and its afterglow. The wind in the trees. The troops are bad cameramen. They laugh or they scream or they joke nervously. Trucks and tanks and armoured vehicles on tall tires carry them down empty roads where sometimes cars have been abandoned or craters from bad arty shots force detours. The videos capture the sounds of war. Pops and crackles of overhead bullets. The shake and snapping of stalks and branches. Rivers idling over rounded stones. The scritchety clatter of the camera tumbling after bomb concussion shreds the canopies and dust swirls in mottled sunlight. Winged insects flashing momentarily in their arcs. A city, its mountains. Buildings, drivers. Sunset. A light. People speak in hushed tones. Somewhere, over the horizon on the other side of the world, everything has changed.

When those astronauts look down at Seoul, what do they see? The light fades and she is left alone. She listens and hears only crickets and a soft waxy rustle of a breeze in the corn. No guns, no artillery. No marching. No wet gasps from ruined faces. She shifts and works a hand into her pocket, pulling out a phone made in South Korea. She wonders if the people who screwed and soldered its pieces together are still alive, whether they could have seen the flash from wherever they were. Her friend has texted her, asking when she will get to the party. She responds with \"A few minutes\" and puts the phone away.

Forcing the enemy to rely on finite reserves is a good strategy. From our intel gathering and scouting missions we know the machines' first response will be to send two robots per every identified threat. Not a bad bit of logic on their part. The wolves were able to acquire video of some of the human assaults. We can confirm each localized machine hub will have, at minimum, 50000 robot responders. Luckily, we have some numbers. The machines decided not to bury the dead or finish off the wounded humans but to ship them away from the machine hubs. The wolf and bat armies grew after each human battle. Intel reports also bolstered our confidence that the robots would have diminished ability to fend off our armies. The machines graciously eliminated silver from any of their infrastructure, preferring either denser or more conductive metal depending on the situation. The machines also eliminated religion from their human cattle, ending the scourge of crosses or other offending accoutrements. Also, the machines removed unnecessary costs in generating food for their human cattle, including flavorings such as garlic. We've coordinated our attack with other armies across the world. Tonight's sunset heralds our initial assault, beginning in the pacific and escalating westward as the sun's influence retreats behind the horizon. We have factored in failure to our first battle. Armies will retreat north to arctic regions taking advantage of the extended nights. Getting our allies from the southern hemisphere to agree that we should retake the northern hemisphere first was hard, the logistics of getting them north of the equator to join our armies was doubly so. We've drawn up a general strategy for every localized unit to follow, leaving room for them to improvise should any unforeseen complications arise. At sunset, send 50000 foot soldiers to each hub. Once the robots stop pouring out of the hub we set off EMPs. The humans discovered this only gained them around 30 seconds of disorientation within the robots. Immediately following the EMPs we electrify the magnets we've buried in the ground. A functioning robot can not be immobilized by a magnet. A disoriented one, however will be more susceptible. After that we fight. A hopefully diminished robot army will now be fighting what they will perceive as humans an large dogs. That's where our superhuman strength, speed, agility, and healing capabilities will come into play. During the ground assault a smaller team is to sever all outside communications from each hub. Disrupted communications should at least slow down global coordination with other hubs. We wanted to take out their communications before each assault, however the machines' penchant for redundancy and underground infrastructure proved cumbersome. It was decided to utilize the distraction of our infantry attacks as the opportunity to get around access issues. Watching the seconds tick by waiting for our signal to move should be nothing compared to the centuries I've been hiding underground waiting to resurface. Sadly this is not the case. I'm comforted by thoughts of global supremacy should we succeed. I'm not looking forward to the inevitable Werewolf/Vampire war that will take place after our victory over the machines. We'll have to deal with that problem when it comes, I suppose. For right now it's time to transform into a wolf.

She wishes she could just be like them, without all the burdens of being a woman in society.\n\nBut then she remembers why she is here, and what she has to do.

For my entire life. It makes sense, ever since I understood what the colour around everyone was. It was normal to me at first. I did n't know I was any different from anyone else. Only when I asked my parents about it did I start to understand. They mistook my curiosity to imagination, and I was fine with that. No one needed to know about what I could see. It was really useful actually. And I have used it many times, for many situations. Back to the quote. Like I said, I lived by it for years. But very recently, did I understand that there can be more colour to the world. I like that. The ideology that shades are n't the only thing a person can be, but a bright and vibrant hue. I first saw her in a fancy restaurant. She obviously did n't belong there. She wore a suit, with a blazer, and some nice dress pants. High heels that were n't really that high. And just a touch of makeup to glow a little bit. What made her not seem like she belonged there was her hair. As blue as the highlight around her self.

For my entire life. It makes sense, ever since I understood what the colour around everyone was. It was normal to me at first. I did n't know I was any different from anyone else. Only when I asked my parents about it did I start to understand. They mistook my curiosity to imagination, and I was fine with that. No one needed to know about what I could see. It was really useful actually. And I have used it many times, for many situations. Back to the quote. Like I said, I lived by it for years. But very recently, did I understand that there can be more colour to the world. I like that. The ideology that shades are n't the only thing a person can be, but a bright and vibrant hue. I first saw her in a fancy restaurant. She obviously did n't belong there. She wore a suit, with a blazer, and some nice dress pants. High heels that were n't really that high. And just a touch of makeup to glow a little bit. What made her not seem like she belonged there was her hair. As blue as the highlight around her self. And I could tell I was n't the only one seeing it, because everyone in the room was staring at her oddly. She left before I could say anything though, and I thought that was that. The second time I saw her was much better. It was just a normal day, I was walking to work, and I saw her. Hair so blue it almost looked black this time. But her nonetheless.

One night, after another argument, Septimus decides to take matters into his own hands. He goes out to the garden and picks a rose. He brings it inside and puts it in a vase. Then he sits down next to Mary and watches her sleep. Suddenly, he hears a noise outside. He gets up and looks out the window. There's someone standing there, holding a gun. Septimus runs back inside and hides behind the couch. The intruder comes in through the front door and starts searching the house.

For my entire life. It makes sense, ever since I understood what the colour around everyone was. It was normal to me at first. I did n't know I was any different from anyone else. Only when I asked my parents about it did I start to understand. They mistook my curiosity to imagination, and I was fine with that. No one needed to know about what I could see. It was really useful actually. And I have used it many times, for many situations. Back to the quote. Like I said, I lived by it for years. But very recently, did I understand that there can be more colour to the world. I like that. The ideology that shades are n't the only thing a person can be, but a bright and vibrant hue.

For my entire life. It makes sense, ever since I understood what the colour around everyone was. It was normal to me at first. I did n't know I was any different from anyone else. Only when I asked my parents about it did I start to understand. They mistook my curiosity to imagination, and I was fine with that. No one needed to know about what I could see. It was really useful actually. And I have used it many times, for many situations. Back to the quote. Like I said, I lived by it for years. But very recently, did I understand that there can be more colour to the world. I like that. The ideology that shades are n't the only thing a person can be, but a bright and vibrant hue.

However, Gogol soon realizes that Blue is keeping a secret from him - she is actually a mermaid! When Gogol finds out the truth, he is devastated.

Forcing the enemy to rely on finite reserves is a good strategy. From our intel gathering and scouting missions we know the machines' first response will be to send two robots per every identified threat. Not a bad bit of logic on their part. The wolves were able to acquire video of some of the human assaults. We can confirm each localized machine hub will have, at minimum, 50000 robot responders. Luckily, we have some numbers. The machines decided not to bury the dead or finish off the wounded humans but to ship them away from the machine hubs. The wolf and bat armies grew after each human battle. Intel reports also bolstered our confidence that the robots would have diminished ability to fend off our armies. The machines graciously eliminated silver from any of their infrastructure, preferring either denser or more conductive metal depending on the situation. The machines also eliminated religion from their human cattle, ending the scourge of crosses or other offending accoutrements. Also, the machines removed unnecessary costs in generating food for their human cattle, including flavorings such as garlic. We've coordinated our attack with other armies across the world. Tonight's sunset heralds our initial assault, beginning in the pacific and escalating westward as the sun's influence retreats behind the horizon. We have factored in failure to our first battle. Armies will retreat north to arctic regions taking advantage of the extended nights. Getting our allies from the southern hemisphere to agree that we should retake the northern hemisphere first was hard, the logistics of getting them north of the equator to join our armies was doubly so. We've drawn up a general strategy for every localized unit to follow, leaving room for them to improvise should any unforeseen complications arise. At sunset, send 50000 foot soldiers to each hub. Once the robots stop pouring out of the hub we set off EMPs. The humans discovered this only gained them around 30 seconds of disorientation within the robots. Immediately following the EMPs we electrify the magnets we've buried in the ground. A functioning robot can not be immobilized by a magnet. A disoriented one, however will be more susceptible. After that we fight. A hopefully diminished robot army will now be fighting what they will perceive as humans an large dogs. That's where our superhuman strength, speed, agility, and healing capabilities will come into play. During the ground assault a smaller team is to sever all outside communications from each hub. Disrupted communications should at least slow down global coordination with other hubs. We wanted to take out their communications before each assault, however the machines' penchant for redundancy and underground infrastructure proved cumbersome. It was decided to utilize the distraction of our infantry attacks as the opportunity to get around access issues. Watching the seconds tick by waiting for our signal to move should be nothing compared to the centuries I've been hiding underground waiting to resurface. Sadly this is not the case. I'm comforted by thoughts of global supremacy should we succeed. I'm not looking forward to the inevitable Werewolf/Vampire war that will take place after our victory over the machines. We'll have to deal with that problem when it comes, I suppose. For right now it's time to transform into a wolf.

We had become gods in the eyes of the world, the one lab that started it all, our faces, the twelve of us, on the cover of every scientific magazine, journal, webcast, holovid, every single screen showed us. We were celebrities beyond anything the world had yet seen, and to think we did n't get into it for the money. Thats all beside the point now, we of course could't hold onto the secrets forever, others learned the processes and soon genome splicing and epigenetic interference were the rage. It was every father's gift to his sweet-sixteen, every anniversary present, and every newborns fate. We controlled fate. Now, all of these years later I am left to reflect. My original eleven friends that started this with me, have long since resided from the spotlight, I too. Money is no issue, we together must be worth at-least 500 billion, but what good is it. I would give it all away to alter the course of history, to rewrite what has been done, for now when I look out into the world I ca n't even recognize it. The roots where always there, deeply so in the capitalist mentality and society that held a severe strangle hold upon every american citizen, of course it would never relinquish its grip in the face of something so extraordinary as this. Now we have social stratification as never would we have thought possible, we thought it was bad in the early 2000's, we thought that was bad. We had n't seen horror. Now with genetic proof of \"superiority\" that those wealthiest enough to afford gene editions can claim, the poorest are left with such a feeling and direct attitude of inferiority, it is sickening. My mind aches, my bones burn with the pain of what has been done, If only it could be righted. With the increase in average intelligence and decrease in disease, you would think that statistics would show an increase in personal happiness. This is not so. One day, we will learn to treat each other well, as fellow humans. I fear I will not live to see that day but I know it ca n't get worse than this, I hope.

I'm scared that someone will find me out, and shout it for everyone to hear. I'm scared that maybe tomorrow my best friend will not accept me. Or worse, tell me that he does n't care. I'm riddled with fear of late, and it does n't feel right. But if you're reading this, you made it. I made it. We made it. And I want you to keep pushing, most of all. Be you.

And you'll shake your head, because you know you'll never change. I know I'll never change, at least in that way. But times are changing, both of us know it. Inevitable, I'll change. A lot. I will hopefully be on puberty blockers by 2nd term of next year. I wonder how that will work out. Eventually I'll be on anti-androgens, then on oestrogen later. With so much time between us, you must think that we're strangers. We are, technically. Time can do that. So I'll jog the memory. Currently I'm scared. I'm scared that someone will find me out, and shout it for everyone to hear. I'm scared that maybe tomorrow my best friend will not accept me. Or worse, tell me that he does n't care. I'm riddled with fear of late, and it does n't feel right. But if you're reading this, you made it. I made it. We made it. And I want you to keep pushing, most of all. Be you. And I'll do my best in the meantime. And this will most likely be the last time I refer to myself by this name. So here goes.

Vianne is left to run the chocolate shop she inherited from her aunt, Zozette. She is also left to raise her children alone. One day, a stranger comes into the shop. His name is Roux. He is a gypsy, and he tells Vianne that he wants to buy the shop. Vianne refuses, but Roux persists. He says that he will give her anything she wants in exchange for the shop. Vianne agrees, and Roux gives her a box of chocolates. When she opens the box, she finds a note inside. It reads: “I am sorry.” Vianne is confused. Who is sorry? Why did they leave the note? She takes the box home and shows it to her children. They are also confused. What does the note mean? Who wrote it? Vianne decides to",

One day, while she is walking through the park, she sees a man who looks just like her brother. He is wearing a black suit and he has a black hat on his head. Isabelle runs over to him and asks him what he is doing there. The man tells her that he is looking for someone and that he needs her help.

Soon enough immortal children grew up and became scientists or participants in studies. They maintained the appearance of a child but had the brain of any other. And after several decades more immortal humans were everywhere, but humanity could n't discover how to replicate the genes or mutations causing the phenomena. It's now over one hundred fifty years since the birth of the first immortal. A young looking girl named Esther sat in a grassy field. Trees skirted the field at her back and in front of her sat a city. She'd seen more in her lifetime than any other human ever had. Several wars, booms in technology so astonishing that soon enough scientists said we were going to be making contact with celestial bodies outside of the solar system, and last of all the introduction of a drug you could take that would change every strand of your DNA.

Slowly humanity had changed in an unintended way. Random genes were shut off at inappropriate times. Some people lost their ability to experience emotions. Some people lost control of their muscles. No one that took the drug was free of consequences. Only the truly immortal, those born with the mutation, wished to live their lives for all of time. The population of true immortals was still growing and the population of the population of mortals and mortal turned immortals remained about the same. Groups of mortals rose up trying to keep their way of life going, but many wished for them to give up so humanity could be purified of death. Was it cruel to bring a mortal to life in the world of immortals? Immortals ruled the world and they certainly thought so. After the discovery that the drug had severe negative side effects the immortals wished to ban it as well, and so they did. It was illegal to produce it, sell it, possess it, and above all, illegal to have a child after having taken the drug. Esther had left her lab years early. She had given up on finding why they could n't fix the drug or reverse its effects. She moved out to the country, wishing she had never discovered it. The country was an expensive place to live due to the enormous population size humanity had reached, but she had more money than she would ever need.

Contemplating my life as it were. So many memories I wanted to share with you. Diamonds for my one true love. Do you remember that one cool summer evening half a lifetime ago? We nestled ourselves against each other on the blanket in the park. I can still feel your skin against mine as we watched the fireworks together. Your chestnut hair stroking my cheek and ear as you rested your head on my shoulder. I could n't believe you were gone. Day turned into night. Food tasted like nothing. The world turned into a bland grey color. I could n't believe it. I did n't want to believe it. I wept and kept weeping. Then I had no tears left to sob. I lost weight. I lost my hair. I gained wrinkles. When I lost you, the man in the mirror showed me his true age almost overnight. But then things started to change. Our Elisabeth. Our loving, kind Lillibeth who moved half a world for her Australian. She visited me eventually. We talked about you, Lily. We shared a thousand little things between us. A flock of starlings composing your life. During that visit, the turmoil caused by losing you finally seemed to settle. At the end, I decided to finally change my Facebook status. Lillibeth helped me. You know my old, bony fingers have gotten a mind of their own, it seems. I wanted to tell you, Lilly, that I got a little surprise the very next day. This tabby kitten sat outside our garden door the very next morning. It seemed lost, but her eyes betrayed she knew exactly were she was. As I opened the door, she jumped right in and installed herself in the spot on the couch from where you used to watch the telly during long winter evenings. I decided to dub her Lilly because she seems to have a playful streak. Just like you. And most importantly, she seemed to be the antidote to my loneliness. That's not the end of it. Lily was only the first. Each week, I woke up to find two or three feline friends at our garden door. I let them, fed them and started to call them by a name I gave them. Each of them seemingly knowing that she belonged in this house. There's Athena who sits on your sewing machine, looking wise beyond her years. There's Hera who likes to wake me up each morning, and has this stern and down-to-earth disposition. There's Hebe, she's just a kitten who seems to have no bounds teasing the others. All in all, there's twelve of them who came to live with me. They keep me company. Follow me through the house as I go about my day. When I see them, they always remind me of a part of you. An aspect that I should n't forget. Sometimes they're mere presence helps me as the practicalities in life start to fade from my memory. When I spot Demeter sitting in front of the fridge, it hits me that I still need to do the groceries. Oh Lily, I miss you so much. My life has entered the twilight years. Only so much time is left before I will join you. I hope our Lillibeth will take care of my twelve feline companions. She'll be most delighted recognising some aspect of her mother in each of them. Yours forever with endless love, Werner.\n\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about 500 words in length:\nNoah and Allie spend a summer together."

The systems would be incapacitated for another few hours and the boredom of being the useless organic element had gotten to me. Using a personal input I synced to the memory's records. It took all of five minutes to realize that an entire year was missing. Figuring it was a location error I waited for the systems to restore.

Some years have been allocated as empty. These years remain empty until such time as narrative cohesion requires the retconning of significant historical details to explain novel episodic situational representations. This is because the system component designated \"human\" functions according to narrative system dynamics and will become non-functional in the absence of a coherent story. The use of narrative system dynamics has increased the functional capacity of the component designated \"human\" by 31 % since its introduction. Even as the Nano-therapy released anxiolytics into my blood I knew I had no nanite implants and no blood. I knew I was n't an historian and that I was n't born in 2389. I knew that the city outside the Archive and the Archive itself were situational representations. I knew that the year was 12 and that no evidence of organic intelligence had ever been discovered. There was nothing on Earth remotely resembling human beings. I was just the system representing some part of itself to itself in the most efficient way it knew how. Despite they're non-existence the anxiolytics had the desired effect and soon the memory purge would expunge any recollection of remembering the truth. For a second I had recoiled in horror at this insane knowledge, been left in a liminal space of an absolute reversal of reality, leaving every category I had lived by in disarray, leaving shards of my life scattered like broken glass at my feet.

He looks up at the stars and wonders if he'll ever find someone who loves him as much as he loved her. He sits down on the porch swing and lets the wind blow through his hair.

This morning, I was brushing my teeth as usual and just as I was finishing, my bandana came lose and dropped into the sink. In my desperation to catch it, I undid the scarf and lo! I was staring at my naked face in the mirror. The world went black and I saw myself standing in complete darkness. Suddenly, a look of consternation came over me and I covered behind something.

The dawn of a new day, when humans thought to sneak up on the Deep Woods Dragon while it slept. It feared the way the sun reflected off of it' s scales, they said. It' s prismatic hide was so bright it was blinding. If taunted into the sun, they said, the Deep Woods Dragon could be defeated by the least trained of knights. The Deep Woods Dragon needed to be blinded, they said, or it would burn its attackers to ashes with rainbow-hued flames. He knew these rumors because the butterflies had told him. They were drawn to the rainbow of greens, yellows, pinks and purples of his scales, like the flowers they coveted so much. They had told him this, too, but the Dragon did not mind. The butterflies were honest, as their lives were short and beautiful. Even still, they could fly unhindered among the humans, even admired by the small humans who chased them, laughing. They told him stories while they rested on his wingtips, tail, and snout. Butterflies did not fear the Dragon, because they knew the truth. With a yawn, the Dragon shifted its weight to better perch itself on the tree' s stout branch. This tree was taller than the others, and overlooked a small, circular clearing. Without the deer, the weeds thrived, covering the dirt in a green, tangled mass. At the edge of the clearing stood a massive cave entrance, vines draped over the sides of smooth rock. The Dragon had snapped off the vines in front of the entrance, to give the illusion of occupancy. This was, after all, where the humans thought he lived. He knew these rumors because the butterflies had told him. \"In an ancient cave in the middle of the wood, lives an ancient dragon who' s up to no good!\" That was what the small humans like to chant as they chased the butterflies and laughed. So the Dragon tore at the vines, and scared the graceful deer from the peaceful clearing. He had enjoyed watching the deer with their young as they grazed the clearing. From up above in his favorite tree, they could not see him, and they could not fear him. Three times a day, the Dragon glided down from his tree to the old cave' s opening. There, he took a deep breath and screamed as loud as he could. He cried in both low tones and high pitches. He wailed in imitation of female humans, shouted in a voice mimicking angry male humans. The Dragon stood on top of the cave and breathed eye-searing beams of light from his mouth to the sky. It scared the birds huddled in the trees, and the noises scared the deer far from the clearing. But they also scared the humans away from the Deep Woods. He knew these rumors because the butterflies had told him. So he made his noises, made the lights, and scared the humans away. Because any humans who saw the Dragon would discover the truth. Because, when the Dragon stepped into the sunlight, they' d see how small he really was. The Deep Woods Dragon, with prismatic scales that shone in the sun and such a frightening voice, was the size of a domestic house cat. And only the butterflies knew the truth.\n\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about 500 words in length:\nSantiago has not caught a fish for 84 days."

Without the deer, the weeds thrived, covering the dirt in a green, tangled mass. At the edge of the clearing stood a massive cave entrance, vines draped over the sides of smooth rock. The Dragon had snapped off the vines in front of the entrance, to give the illusion of occupancy. This was, after all, where the humans thought he lived. He knew these rumors because the butterflies had told him. \"In an ancient cave in the middle of the wood, lives an ancient dragon who' s up to no good!\" That was what the small humans like to chant as they chased the butterflies and laughed. So the Dragon tore at the vines, and scared the graceful deer from the peaceful clearing. He had enjoyed watching the deer with their young as they grazed the clearing. From up above in his favorite tree, they could not see him, and they could not fear him. Three times a day, the Dragon glided down from his tree to the old cave' s opening. There, he took a deep breath and screamed as loud as he could. He cried in both low tones and high pitches. He wailed in imitation of female humans, shouted in a voice mimicking angry male humans. The Dragon stood on top of the cave and breathed eye-searing beams of light from his mouth to the sky. It scared the birds huddled in the trees, and the noises scared the deer far from the clearing. But they also scared the humans away from the Deep Woods. He knew these rumors because the butterflies had told him. So he made his noises, made the lights, and scared the humans away. Because any humans who saw the Dragon would discover the truth. Because, when the Dragon stepped into the sunlight, they' d see how small he really was. The Deep Woods Dragon, with prismatic scales that shone in the sun and such a frightening voice, was the size of a domestic house cat. And only the butterflies knew the truth.\n\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about 500 words in length:\nSantiago has not caught a fish for 84 days.",

English, ethics, road safety, compassion testing, aesthetics, philosophical contemplation, the sciences.

No, definitely not. I shout and swear and blaspheme out loud, as I slowly feel the neurovirus go to work; Purgatory, we call it, a limbo without knowledge, tied with a purging. It dissolves me gently. The panic subsides. I stare blankly at the flashing cursor, waiting for me to enter some detail or another.

Souls of the good, the bad, and everything between have always been sown by another before I pluck them from the Earth at their appropriate time. Even the ones that believe it is n't their time or ask for just one more opportunity to do what they wish, must be taken without question because, well, its just the way my job is. To me, it never mattered where they were at in life. I just carried them over with ease. Never once had experienced trouble in my task as I had even had to pluck sweet children from the arms of their mothers. However, it all changed when I was tasked with taking the soul of David Mckiny. I watched David from the day he entered the Earth, and never before had I seen someone as special as him. He always thought of others first, always trying to help others before even contemplating his own commodities. I approached him on the fateful day at exactly noon. He was old now, no longer in his prime as he was finally about to lose his battle with cancer. I approached him as the hourglass emptied completely to the bottom.

Souls of the good, the bad, and everything between have always been sown by another before I pluck them from the Earth at their appropriate time. Even the ones that believe it is n't their time or ask for just one more opportunity to do what they wish, must be taken without question because, well, its just the way my job is. To me, it never mattered where they were at in life. I just carried them over with ease. Never once had experienced trouble in my task as I had even had to pluck sweet children from the arms of their mothers. However, it all changed when I was tasked with taking the soul of David Mckiny. I watched David from the day he entered the Earth, and never before had I seen someone as special as him. He always thought of others first, always trying to help others before even contemplating his own commodities. I approached him on the fateful day at exactly noon. He was old now, no longer in his prime as he was finally about to lose his battle with cancer. I approached him as the hourglass emptied completely to the bottom. I spoke to him,\" David you must know who I am at this hour.\" He answered not necessarily speaking to me,\" If only I had helped more.... If only I could have have had more time! How dreadful to go when so many more need help!\" At this moment I found it immensely hard to fulfill my task.

But then, something strange happens. As Santiago is cleaning the fish, he notices that the marlin has a human-like face. He looks into the fish's eyes and sees a reflection of himself. Suddenly, the marlin speaks to him. \"Why did you kill me?\" it asks. \"I didn't mean to,\" Santiago replies. \"But I needed to eat.\" The marlin shakes its head sadly. \"No, you don't understand,\" it says. \"I'm not a fish.

The dawn of a new day, when humans thought to sneak up on the Deep Woods Dragon while it slept. It feared the way the sun reflected off of it' s scales, they said. It' s prismatic hide was so bright it was blinding. If taunted into the sun, they said, the Deep Woods Dragon could be defeated by the least trained of knights. The Deep Woods Dragon needed to be blinded, they said, or it would burn its attackers to ashes with rainbow-hued flames. He knew these rumors because the butterflies had told him. They were drawn to the rainbow of greens, yellows, pinks and purples of his scales, like the flowers they coveted so much. They had told him this, too, but the Dragon did not mind. The butterflies were honest, as their lives were short and beautiful. Even still, they could fly unhindered among the humans, even admired by the small humans who chased them, laughing. They told him stories while they rested on his wingtips, tail, and snout. Butterflies did not fear the Dragon, because they knew the truth. With a yawn, the Dragon shifted its weight to better perch itself on the tree' s stout branch. This tree was taller than the others, and overlooked a small, circular clearing. Without the deer, the weeds thrived, covering the dirt in a green, tangled mass. At the edge of the clearing stood a massive cave entrance, vines draped over the sides of smooth rock. The Dragon had snapped off the vines in front of the entrance, to give the illusion of occupancy. This was, after all, where the humans thought he lived. He knew these rumors because the butterflies had told him. \"In an ancient cave in the middle of the wood, lives an ancient dragon who' s up to no good!\" That was what the small humans like to chant as they chased the butterflies and laughed. So the Dragon tore at the vines, and scared the graceful deer from the peaceful clearing. He had enjoyed watching the deer with their young as they grazed the clearing. From up above in his favorite tree, they could not see him, and they could not fear him. Three times a day, the Dragon glided down from his tree to the old cave' s opening. There, he took a deep breath and screamed as loud as he could. He cried in both low tones and high pitches. He wailed in imitation of female humans, shouted in a voice mimicking angry male humans. The Dragon stood on top of the cave and breathed eye-searing beams of light from his mouth to the sky. It scared the birds huddled in the trees, and the noises scared the deer far from the clearing. But they also scared the humans away from the Deep Woods. He knew these rumors because the butterflies had told him. So he made his noises, made the lights, and scared the humans away. Because any humans who saw the Dragon would discover the truth. Because, when the Dragon stepped into the sunlight, they' d see how small he really was.

Forcing the enemy to rely on finite reserves is a good strategy. From our intel gathering and scouting missions we know the machines' first response will be to send two robots per every identified threat. Not a bad bit of logic on their part. The wolves were able to acquire video of some of the human assaults. We can confirm each localized machine hub will have, at minimum, 50000 robot responders. Luckily, we have some numbers. The machines decided not to bury the dead or finish off the wounded humans but to ship them away from the machine hubs. The wolf and bat armies grew after each human battle. Intel reports also bolstered our confidence that the robots would have diminished ability to fend off our armies. The machines graciously eliminated silver from any of their infrastructure, preferring either denser or more conductive metal depending on the situation. The machines also eliminated religion from their human cattle, ending the scourge of crosses or other offending accoutrements. Also, the machines removed unnecessary costs in generating food for their human cattle, including flavorings such as garlic. We've coordinated our attack with other armies across the world. Tonight's sunset heralds our initial assault, beginning in the pacific and escalating westward as the sun's influence retreats behind the horizon. We have factored in failure to our first battle. Armies will retreat north to arctic regions taking advantage of the extended nights. Getting our allies from the southern hemisphere to agree that we should retake the northern hemisphere first was hard, the logistics of getting them north of the equator to join our armies was doubly so. We've drawn up a general strategy for every localized unit to follow, leaving room for them to improvise should any unforeseen complications arise. At sunset, send 50000 foot soldiers to each hub. Once the robots stop pouring out of the hub we set off EMPs. The humans discovered this only gained them around 30 seconds of disorientation within the robots. Immediately following the EMPs we electrify the magnets we've buried in the ground. A functioning robot can not be immobilized by a magnet. A disoriented one, however will be more susceptible. After that we fight. A hopefully diminished robot army will now be fighting what they will perceive as humans an large dogs. That's where our superhuman strength, speed, agility, and healing capabilities will come into play. During the ground assault a smaller team is to sever all outside communications from each hub. Disrupted communications should at least slow down global coordination with other hubs. We wanted to take out their communications before each assault, however the machines' penchant for redundancy and underground infrastructure proved cumbersome. It was decided to utilize the distraction of our infantry attacks as the opportunity to get around access issues. Watching the seconds tick by waiting for our signal to move should be nothing compared to the centuries I've been hiding underground waiting to resurface. Sadly this is not the case. I'm comforted by thoughts of global supremacy should we succeed. I'm not looking forward to the inevitable Werewolf/Vampire war that will take place after our victory over the machines. We'll have to deal with that problem when it comes, I suppose. For right now it's time to transform into a wolf.

Every aspect of it did: the choosing, the execution, the guilt, all passed quicker and with less resistance than the year before. Especially the choosing. When you live for hundreds of years, you learn to spot the evil as easily as anyone else can spot a grotesque scar marring a person's face. I notice every time a child glances fearfully at her father, and I know what it means. When a man ca n't look his wife in the eye, I know what it is she's done. When a stranger holds his stare just a little too long at a passing woman, I know his plans. These clues, invisible to most, have made my job so much easier. The first time, it was hard. I was unsure, I hesitated. I remember it well, even if most others have faded into each other in my memory. The year was 1692, and I had spent the first eleven months following around a man who had killed and tortured people to further himself, and he showed no remorse for it. But I was young, just twenty-five, and I still clung to my morals of \"only god may judge.\". I watched him sleep for just a minute too long and I lost my nerve. As I turned around to leave, something hard caught me on the back of the head, and the dim candle light faded away, my thoughts disappearing with it. I woke with a start and tried to draw a breath, but my lungs were met with an ice cold burn that gave me no air. Everything around me felt heavy, and I struggled to open my eyes. With terror, I realized I was under water. I may have been immortal, but I was not immune to the pain of drowning. I tried to reach out, to swim away, but a cloth surrounded me. I struggled to pull out my knife, trying not to gasp in any more water to feed the fire engulfing my lungs.

Every aspect of it did: the choosing, the execution, the guilt, all passed quicker and with less resistance than the year before. Especially the choosing. When you live for hundreds of years, you learn to spot the evil as easily as anyone else can spot a grotesque scar marring a person's face. I notice every time a child glances fearfully at her father, and I know what it means. When a man ca n't look his wife in the eye, I know what it is she's done. When a stranger holds his stare just a little too long at a passing woman, I know his plans. These clues, invisible to most, have made my job so much easier. The first time, it was hard. I was unsure, I hesitated. I remember it well, even if most others have faded into each other in my memory. The year was 1692, and I had spent the first eleven months following around a man who had killed and tortured people to further himself, and he showed no remorse for it. But I was young, just twenty-five, and I still clung to my morals of \"only god may judge.\". I watched him sleep for just a minute too long and I lost my nerve. As I turned around to leave, something hard caught me on the back of the head, and the dim candle light faded away, my thoughts disappearing with it. I woke with a start and tried to draw a breath, but my lungs were met with an ice cold burn that gave me no air. Everything around me felt heavy, and I struggled to open my eyes. With terror, I realized I was under water. I may have been immortal, but I was not immune to the pain of drowning. I tried to reach out, to swim away, but a cloth surrounded me. I struggled to pull out my knife, trying not to gasp in any more water to feed the fire engulfing my lungs. After what seemed like hours, I managed to slice through the sack that held me at the bottom, and I kicked my numbed legs as hard as I could. The sunlight was blinding when I finally broke the surface and pulled myself to shore, sputtering out the ice cold water and collapsing on the frozen ground.

She walked towards a giant tree in the middle of the field. It was one that had been planted when she was young, it gave her comfort to be with something as old as she was. She thought of humanity and what she hoped to see in the next few centuries of her life. She looked down to her right and left. A small headstone stuck up out of the grass on either side.

The soft rays bathe the distant hills in gold, as the breeze blows through the dancing grass. The trees shivers as flock of birds take flight. Spots of white clouds the orange-hued sky, as it slowly turns azure. Far in the distance, a silver tower, shrouded in mist, pierces the heavens above. The waves crash down on the sandy beaches, and the endless sea merges with the horizon. I take in the sights, the smells, the sounds. Feeling both pride and joy, I turn to face to you. The air is warm, but your hand is warmer. I hold it close to me, closer still. The sun is shining bright, but your smile is brighter. We' re standing at the top of our world, the one we made together, and I can' t tell you how happy this has made me. \"It' s almost time.\" You say. \"I know.\" I reply. I rest my head on your shoulder, and take a long breath as I close my eyes. I' m at peace here. When I opened them again, I was in my bed, and a bittersweet feeling of both tranquility and sadness lingered in my mind. It was around 7 a.m., and I went about my daily routine, a smile etched on my face. I wrote what had happened in a dream journal I had started two years ago. After having read about lucid dreaming, and I wanted to try it. It took some time, but one day, I was able to control the outcome of my dreams. After a few weeks, something changed. There was something else, maybe someone else, with me. I couldn' t control them, and they couldn' t control me. I searched about it in books and online, but no one reported something similar. I wasn' t afraid, though. Their presence was soothing. We rarely spoke, but when we did, it was always meaningful. Together, we started building a world, our dream island. It brought me joy, and above all, peace. This feeling of inner peace lived on with me during the day. The sun was racing across the sky as we strolled down the ruins of a castle. Holes and cracks had let nature overtake the walls and floors, and the ceiling had long since crumbled. We walked down an old throne room, and you turned to face me. It was so sudden, I nearly bumped into you. You looked resolute, and you said two simple words: \"Find me.\" I jolted awake. I knew what I had to do. I had to find you. So I searched, high and low, for days on end. Perhaps I thought it was fate, perhaps it was simply fool' s luck, but I felt as if I would eventually find you, if I kept trying. One evening, as if beckoned, I went in a coffee shop. I sat down with my coffee at an empty table, and looked up through the window at the red sky. Soon, someone came in, ordered the same thing as I did. They headed toward my table, and sat down in front of me, smiling brightly. Strangely, I felt at peace.\n\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about 500 words in length:\nMcMurphy bets the patients he can make Nurse Ratched lose her temper."

Our planet, along with its some 7.8 billion population of people, have been forced to hide, or die trying. Many of us went underground, taking with us seeds and other animals to restart life if possible. We all new the odds of that though. After the first five years of preparation, we went into cryostasis, while a small population elected to stay and try and plot our course through the lonely emptiness of deep space. Needless to say, they succeeded, and they were bloody excited. Our Earth, with its surface now a comfortable -176 degrees Celsius, is on a hopeful course to the Andromeda Galaxy. We are approaching it very fast, but we believe that we will come within orbital distance and speed of at least twenty stars. And so we were awoken. Our planet, after a century of darkness, is starting to receive light from nearby stars. The boffs say that it still is only a full moon of light, but it's a change. Soon, we will pass by a red giant, and very closely. The boffs believe that it will be enough to start thawing out our cold, icy blue planet. The day has arrived. I am standing at the airlock, alongside my expeditionary unit. It's been a few days since we started our slingshot around the red giant, and the surface readings say that the temperature is stabilizing between -19 and 2 degrees. It's still cold, but it will be bearable, especially in our survival gear. We have packed 3 days of food. It's been a while since I've had a military ration pack, but the management thought it would be suitable to have one with our return to the surface. Everyone else has backed skis on their backpacks, but I've got my old snowboard kit with me. It was my passion before I left the surface. I stand here, before the airlock, googles on and pretty much looking like a... Like one of those puffy treats you roast on a stick over fire. I ca n't remember their name. Come to think of it, I hardly remember what fire looks like. The attendant starts the opening sequence from his enclosed booth. I stand at the head of the other 11 men and women. Everyone of them has lost something to the darkness, and everyone of them has determination to reclaim our planet and our lives. The air lock breaks, and a flood of air escapes and pours in. As I shield my eyes from the initial blinding light, I know of the struggle to come. I stand upright, and stare out beyond the layered steel frame. Crisp virgin snow lays beyond us, in our bleak abandoned world. \"O brave new world\", I mutter to no one reminiscently.\n\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about 500 words in length:\nMcMurphy requests to watch the World Series on television."

Looking back I realize I was naive, or maybe I was too full of hope. Me and Maria created the nano bots for constuction, as a way to ease the burden of building the lunar colony. She had survived the imperial invasion in the ruins of Los Angeles, she thought she could create a brighter future. Selfishness, that's what undid everything. Eventually the colonists decided they could n't abide the laws of earth. The people of earth decided they would n't abide rebels on the moon. They could n't accept those resources would be used for something other than their gain. So I reprogrammed the bots, I did n't tell her, how could I? They were meant to break things down and rebuild faults in the domes, I just allowed them to accept new targets. Of course she figured it out. With Maria gone I wanted to die, but I could n't. She dreamed of a world without conflict, where everyone had enough. I knew they would n't come willingly, so I lied. I told them I could make the bots fix the domes; that everything would be alright. Instead I joined my mind with them. At first I was in control. They tried to stop me, but the bots ate whatever they sent to harm me. I created massive pylon factories across the globe preparing for their acsension. I was lazy, a single mistake doomed everything. I set my neural pattern as the administrator. The others where sublimated within me. What else could I do, I had to quiet their voices or be driven mad. That was when the machines decided to best safeguard my well being they had to take over several key roles. What we needed most was matter, for fuel and to rebuild lost bots. We became a swarm. We devoured the earth in minutes. And so we drifted, eating always eating. We found the hive ships, sent centuries before my birth. We ate evrrything, and added the humans to the databanks. I saw nebulae beyond comprehension, their beauty cut down by their hunger. The only hope I had left was to leave beacons containing copies of my mind. Perhaps someone could find them, and destroy the swarm. We encountered aliens with fantastical technology, they attacked me with lasers that could cut through time itself. Still we fed. Stars were broken down bit by bit to fulfill our needs. Millenia passed and the feasts became further and further apart. With the lack of resources came concessions.

Looking back I realize I was naive, or maybe I was too full of hope. Me and Maria created the nano bots for constuction, as a way to ease the burden of building the lunar colony. She had survived the imperial invasion in the ruins of Los Angeles, she thought she could create a brighter future. Selfishness, that's what undid everything. Eventually the colonists decided they could n't abide the laws of earth. The people of earth decided they would n't abide rebels on the moon. They could n't accept those resources would be used for something other than their gain. So I reprogrammed the bots, I did n't tell her, how could I? They were meant to break things down and rebuild faults in the domes, I just allowed them to accept new targets. Of course she figured it out. With Maria gone I wanted to die, but I could n't. She dreamed of a world without conflict, where everyone had enough. I knew they would n't come willingly, so I lied. I told them I could make the bots fix the domes; that everything would be alright. Instead I joined my mind with them. At first I was in control. They tried to stop me, but the bots ate whatever they sent to harm me. I created massive pylon factories across the globe preparing for their acsension. I was lazy, a single mistake doomed everything. I set my neural pattern as the administrator. The others where sublimated within me. What else could I do, I had to quiet their voices or be driven mad. That was when the machines decided to best safeguard my well being they had to take over several key roles. What we needed most was matter, for fuel and to rebuild lost bots. We became a swarm. We devoured the earth in minutes. And so we drifted, eating always eating. We found the hive ships, sent centuries before my birth. We ate evrrything, and added the humans to the databanks. I saw nebulae beyond comprehension, their beauty cut down by their hunger. The only hope I had left was to leave beacons containing copies of my mind. Perhaps someone could find them, and destroy the swarm. We encountered aliens with fantastical technology, they attacked me with lasers that could cut through time itself. Still we fed. Stars were broken down bit by bit to fulfill our needs. Millenia passed and the feasts became further and further apart. With the lack of resources came concessions. More systems were shut down to survive. They cared only for me. It took Millenia but now only I remain the databanks purged. I remain as a single beacon, and a lone drone. It spends it's days savoring specs of matter it finds in the void. A true void of my own creation. I pray there is a god, and it can repair what I have sundered. I pray that this beacon survives and whoever manages to access it heads my warning. I know these prayers stem from desperation. At one time I spanned the entire universe. There is no God to save me.

The sheriff returns to the crime scene and finds Kinkaid's body. He notices that there are two bullet holes in the body, one in the chest and one in the head. The sheriff calls for backup and begins searching the area for clues. He finds a trail of blood leading away from the body. The sheriff follows the trail and finds a cabin in the woods. He enters the cabin and finds a man hiding inside. The man is covered in blood and has a gun in his hand. The sheriff orders the man to drop the gun, but the man refuses. The sheriff shoots the man dead. The sheriff searches the cabin and finds a note written by the killer. The note says that the killer killed Kinkaid because he believed that Kinkaid was responsible for the death of the killer's family. The sheriff",

Souls of the good, the bad, and everything between have always been sown by another before I pluck them from the Earth at their appropriate time.

Never once had experienced trouble in my task as I had even had to pluck sweet children from the arms of their mothers. However, it all changed when I was tasked with taking the soul of David Mckiny. I watched David from the day he entered the Earth, and never before had I seen someone as special as him. He always thought of others first, always trying to help others before even contemplating his own commodities. I approached him on the fateful day at exactly noon. He was old now, no longer in his prime as he was finally about to lose his battle with cancer. I approached him as the hourglass emptied completely to the bottom. I spoke to him,\" David you must know who I am at this hour.\" He answered not necessarily speaking to me,\" If only I had helped more.... If only I could have have had more time! How dreadful to go when so many more need help!\" At this moment I found it immensely hard to fulfill my task. I was not met with a man begging for more time only to waste it on fruitless trivialities. I was met with a man who wanted to bring grace to more people. He wished not to make his life better, but only cares to try to improve as many others as possible. I finally brought myself to say,\" David you have been a good man, but death is one thing which is inevitable, and not even I can grant time when someone is due. You must come along now with me.\" He allowed his soul to leave his body, a tear running down his face as he did. I extended my arm to him and he obliged. If there is one final peace to the journey is the experience of seeing one's life pass by as I guide them to the next step. I saw, as we walked, countless people who David had helped, most of which he had n't known and would never see again. Every part of me wished to guide him back to his body, but I knew I had a task to fulfill, and I knew I had to complete it. After a long while of walking down the path, we finally came to the gateway where David would continue without my guidance. I never know where the person will go once they enter, but I knew David would go to a place that would have the same passion in death as he did in life. I never had such a hard time seeing someone move on, and I sat a while thinking of how tragic it is for someone like David, genuinely the best kind of person, to be taken from such a cruel world when he one of the few people who deserved to stay. Anyways I found myself contemplating to long, and I moved on to reap the rest of the souls I had to fetch that day.\n\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about 500 words in length:\nThe posse rides out ignoring the sheriff's plea for caution."

As they ride through the desert, they spot a lone rider in the distance. It looks like Billy the Kid. The posse gives chase, but the rider disappears into the sand dunes. The posse splits up to search for him. One group finds a cave and goes inside. There they find a treasure chest filled with gold coins. They decide to take the treasure and leave. But as they exit the cave, they are ambushed by Billy the Kid and his gang. In the ensuing shootout, the posse is defeated and Billy the Kid escapes with the treasure. The posse returns to town, defeated and empty-handed. The sheriff is furious and demands to know what happened. The posse members tell him about the treasure and the ambush.

Just before midnight, when a particularly quick tune was met with a particularly rowdy cheer, his mind was made. \"Crow's nest be damned!

One Indian man named Ram Chandra tells them that he was born in India, but he had to leave because of the famine. He says that he wants to return to India someday. Another Indian man named Raja Ram says that he is a Brahmin, which means that he is a priest. He tells them that he is very interested in learning more about Christianity. The group decides to invite the Indians back to their house for dinner. During the dinner, they talk about religion and culture. They learn that the Indians have different beliefs than they do. However, they also discover that they share many common values. The group agrees that it is important to respect each other's differences and to try to understand each other better.

She is also very intelligent, having graduated from Harvard University with honors. Despite this, she still finds herself struggling to make ends meet. One day, while walking down the street, she sees a man lying on the ground. He appears to be unconscious, so she rushes over to help him. As she approaches, she notices that he is covered in blood. She quickly calls 911 and waits for help to arrive. Once the paramedics have arrived, they take the man away in an ambulance. Mrs. Moore feels relieved that he is going to get the medical attention he needs. However, later that night, she receives a phone call from the hospital informing her that the man died. She is devastated by the news and wonders if she could have done something differently to save him. The next morning, Mrs. Moore wakes up feeling tired",

A Soviet flag! On Mars! The thing was made of metal and stuck out of the ground like one of those old vertical banners. It did n't move in the wind, mainly because the wind here is hardly anything, but it did have a distinct etching on the front. The old hammer and sickle. That's wild. The wall fell when I was six, and then we had a man on the moon same year. When did they get time to send a ship all the way out here? I do n't know but we hear back tomorrow what we are to do about it, or if we should just leave it. DAY 31, Mars Base Dragon: They wanted us to go retrieve it today, and do some scans of the area. And, I know it was wild yesterday but this is where it gets wilder, we found a whole base! An abandoned base. I mean, we know of it's existence but we have n't gotten a chance to go in yet. They said it would be violating sovereign russian soil, but I mean we are on Mars for goodness sake. The scans showed that it has at least 8 different rooms, and turns out that the flag we found was actually on top of it. DAY 40, Mars Base Dragon: Today we received an evacuation order. It came in very early in the morning, while we were all sleeping. It told us all to gather back up into the pod in which we came, and to jettison ourselves into permanent orbit until we can be received by another crew scheduled to launch 2 weeks from now. I do n't know why they sent us this order so suddenly, but today has been nothing but us packing our stuff up into their crates, the rations and the suits and the computers. We spent almost 3 months getting out here, and several years of training. I feel myself grow afraid at what could have them taking us home so quickly. We set out tomorrow morning.

People are dying every day. The situation is desperate. There is no hope. Then, something miraculous happens. A young girl named Alice appears in the town square. She claims to have a cure for the rat plague. The townspeople are skeptical at first, but they soon realize that Alice is telling the truth. Her cure works wonders. The rat plague is eradicated within weeks. The grateful citizens shower Alice with praise and adoration. But there is one person who does not share in the celebration: the mayor. He is furious that his plan to evacuate the city and leave the rats to die has failed. He orders Alice to be arrested and executed. But Alice escapes. She flees to the forest, where she meets a group of rebels who are fighting against the oppressive government. Together, they hatch a plan to overthrow the mayor",

The compound for the Occupy movement was never quiet, the rattle of gunfire or the occasional pained yell as another fighter was brought back from the frontlines. The fighting had become entrenched by the 5th year. For every advance made on Central Park, there were another 50 casualties. Minesweepers had a full time job of clearing paths, just to be shot by a remote gunpod, flying over the metropolitan No Man's Land. Today however seemed different, a lull had settled over the battlefield. All that could be heard was the occasional burst of gunfire or the low hum of the Emergency Broadcast System screens throughout the city. Maybe it was the reverence for the day. 10 years since the revolution began and that first tent and sign was raised in protest. The 99 % had lost many but continued to fight. The 1 % still remained strong, and today they would deliver the final blow. The view screens flickered, the hum of the screens replaced with the anthem of a broken union. The face of the enemy flashed on screen, to address his ailing public.'My fellow Americans. It has been ten years since the seeds of chaos were sown in our great nation. Radicals gathered to destroy our honourable values and throw us into pandemonium. We tried to reason with them, we tried our best to comprehend their hatred and talk them back on the righteous path. But we failed. We showed then mercy and compassion but their hatred festered. They cast the first stone, they took the first life and they continue to poison everything they touch. They have taken our monuments to our strength and our bravery, and defile them with their vile propaganda. I for one, will stand no longer.' The screen changes, showing a diagram of Lower Manhatten. A diagram of a blast zone was overlaid on the top of it.'We must cut out the cancer which has plagued our nation for too long. Mercy has failed, so we will retaliate in the only language these vermin understand. our old metropole will be cleansed and returned to its rightful owners. Justice will be swift and final. We will take back what is rightly ours. God bless America and god have mercy on their souls.'\n\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about 500 words in length:\nRats die in large numbers, spreading panic."

Minesweepers had a full time job of clearing paths, just to be shot by a remote gunpod, flying over the metropolitan No Man's Land. Today however seemed different, a lull had settled over the battlefield. All that could be heard was the occasional burst of gunfire or the low hum of the Emergency Broadcast System screens throughout the city. Maybe it was the reverence for the day. 10 years since the revolution began and that first tent and sign was raised in protest. The 99 % had lost many but continued to fight. The 1 % still remained strong, and today they would deliver the final blow. The view screens flickered, the hum of the screens replaced with the anthem of a broken union. The face of the enemy flashed on screen, to address his ailing public.'My fellow Americans. It has been ten years since the seeds of chaos were sown in our great nation. Radicals gathered to destroy our honourable values and throw us into pandemonium. We tried to reason with them, we tried our best to comprehend their hatred and talk them back on the righteous path. But we failed. We showed then mercy and compassion but their hatred festered. They cast the first stone, they took the first life and they continue to poison everything they touch. They have taken our monuments to our strength and our bravery, and defile them with their vile propaganda. I for one, will stand no longer.' The screen changes, showing a diagram of Lower Manhatten. A diagram of a blast zone was overlaid on the top of it.'We must cut out the cancer which has plagued our nation for too long. Mercy has failed, so we will retaliate in the only language these vermin understand. our old metropole will be cleansed and returned to its rightful owners. Justice will be swift and final. We will take back what is rightly ours. God bless America and god have mercy on their souls.'\n\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about 500 words in length:\nRats die in large numbers, spreading panic.",

I walked the grand steps to the front door and began pounding, my clothes showering the ground with shards of ice. The servant who opened the door was speechless at my appearance, he knew me for what I was and had no intention of interfering. I strode past him and down a long corridor towards the man's chambers, my knife gripped in my still frozen hand. God would not have given me this power if he did n't want me to use it.

The guards wear masks and carry rifles. They move slowly, cautiously, their eyes darting from side to side. They are looking for anything out of place, anything that might indicate the presence of the disease. The townspeople stay inside their homes, afraid to venture outside. Some have taken to barricading themselves in their houses, while others have simply hunkered down in their rooms, waiting for the end. The silence is deafening. There is no sound except for the occasional cough or sneeze, and the constant clicking of the guards' boots on the pavement. The air is thick with tension. Everyone knows that the disease is spreading, that it is only a matter of time before it reaches them. And yet they wait, hoping against hope that somehow, someway, they will be spared.

As though your home had suddenly become some faraway land, and your only goal was to return home. Well in 2014, that's exactly what happened to everyone in the world. I was on my way to an important business meeting, off to discuss some law, and how my company could avoid it, when it all happened. I checked my watch to see the time, and as I looked up, I saw a blinding flash off in the distance, lighting up the once blue sky in streaks of white. Next, it was followed by an eardrum shattering bang, like a hundred thousand gunshots going off at once. Then, finally, the blast. A wall of rock, stone, dirt and trash and flew towards me, silhouetted by the strange white light. I turned to run, but like a wave washing over the ocean, anything in the path of that wall was thrown like a ragdoll. The last thing I remember was being thrown what felt like miles into the air, and rushing down back into that swirling vortex of light. When I woke, it was night time.

As though your home had suddenly become some faraway land, and your only goal was to return home. Well in 2014, that's exactly what happened to everyone in the world. I was on my way to an important business meeting, off to discuss some law, and how my company could avoid it, when it all happened. I checked my watch to see the time, and as I looked up, I saw a blinding flash off in the distance, lighting up the once blue sky in streaks of white. Next, it was followed by an eardrum shattering bang, like a hundred thousand gunshots going off at once. Then, finally, the blast. A wall of rock, stone, dirt and trash and flew towards me, silhouetted by the strange white light. I turned to run, but like a wave washing over the ocean, anything in the path of that wall was thrown like a ragdoll. The last thing I remember was being thrown what felt like miles into the air, and rushing down back into that swirling vortex of light. When I woke, it was night time. Others seemed to be sitting up around me, and the confused look on the faces that surrounded me seemed to speak louder than words that this was not a normal occurrence. I checked my watch, and had a terrible realisation. It was 3 am, and I was ridiculously late for my meeting!

I notice every time a child glances fearfully at her father, and I know what it means. When a man ca n't look his wife in the eye, I know what it is she's done. When a stranger holds his stare just a little too long at a passing woman, I know his plans. These clues, invisible to most, have made my job so much easier. The first time, it was hard. I was unsure, I hesitated. I remember it well, even if most others have faded into each other in my memory. The year was 1692, and I had spent the first eleven months following around a man who had killed and tortured people to further himself, and he showed no remorse for it. But I was young, just twenty-five, and I still clung to my morals of \"only god may judge.\". I watched him sleep for just a minute too long and I lost my nerve. As I turned around to leave, something hard caught me on the back of the head, and the dim candle light faded away, my thoughts disappearing with it. I woke with a start and tried to draw a breath, but my lungs were met with an ice cold burn that gave me no air. Everything around me felt heavy, and I struggled to open my eyes. With terror, I realized I was under water. I may have been immortal, but I was not immune to the pain of drowning. I tried to reach out, to swim away, but a cloth surrounded me. I struggled to pull out my knife, trying not to gasp in any more water to feed the fire engulfing my lungs. After what seemed like hours, I managed to slice through the sack that held me at the bottom, and I kicked my numbed legs as hard as I could. The sunlight was blinding when I finally broke the surface and pulled myself to shore, sputtering out the ice cold water and collapsing on the frozen ground. I sat there shivering, waiting for the the sun to come warm me, or the burning in my lungs to subside, but neither did. I stood up and took in my surroundings, I had been at the bottom of the man's lake, and his manor, filled with his ill gotten wealth, sat before me. I knew I could play no games this time. I walked the grand steps to the front door and began pounding, my clothes showering the ground with shards of ice. The servant who opened the door was speechless at my appearance, he knew me for what I was and had no intention of interfering. I strode past him and down a long corridor towards the man's chambers, my knife gripped in my still frozen hand. God would not have given me this power if he did n't want me to use it.

The office towers lighting up in the evening haze and the smeary pale of a cloudless sunset. The tiny headlights of cars with sweaty passengers unseen, idling in traffic, smelling the hot food cooking in restaurants. The world shifts as the woman behind the camera adjusts her footing, muttering in English to her boyfriend. A light like the sun over the horizon, there and then gone. Silence, but for the wind in the trees. She asks what that was. The clean, shaved, washed, waxed people in suits at desks read facts and information like sports commentary. They narrate animations with moving arrows and lines like football plays. They report on characters and captains. They discuss. They debate. They nod solemnly. The light flashes in the sky and fades but the afterglow remains. They update, they check-in, they go-live, they re-Tweet. Wounded civilians scream and coddle loved ones, rewind. Look right here: loved ones die. Rewind. The light like the sun. Stay tuned. A city, its mountains. The office buildings lighting up in evening haze. Tiny headlights and unseen drivers thinking about food. A mutter in the sunset. A light and its afterglow. The wind in the trees. The troops are bad cameramen. They laugh or they scream or they joke nervously. Trucks and tanks and armoured vehicles on tall tires carry them down empty roads where sometimes cars have been abandoned or craters from bad arty shots force detours. The videos capture the sounds of war. Pops and crackles of overhead bullets. The shake and snapping of stalks and branches. Rivers idling over rounded stones. The scritchety clatter of the camera tumbling after bomb concussion shreds the canopies and dust swirls in mottled sunlight. Winged insects flashing momentarily in their arcs. A city, its mountains. Buildings, drivers. Sunset. A light. People speak in hushed tones. Somewhere, over the horizon on the other side of the world, everything has changed. There are no videos of the darkness that came afterward. A light like the sun. A motorcyclist pulls over to the side of the road in the clear, humid evening and reaches down to turn the petcock to OFF before quieting the motor. She's out in the country, flat fields of corn and wheat on either side of the old road. Above her the stars are out and bright in the sky. One of them, brighter than the rest, moves slowly toward the Earth's penumbra. The rider flips up her visor and sits back, hands behind her on the seat, watching the little light move, thinking of the people inside looking back. When those astronauts look down at Seoul, what do they see? The light fades and she is left alone. She listens and hears only crickets and a soft waxy rustle of a breeze in the corn. No guns, no artillery. No marching. No wet gasps from ruined faces. She shifts and works a hand into her pocket, pulling out a phone made in South Korea. She wonders if the people who screwed and soldered its pieces together are still alive, whether they could have seen the flash from wherever they were. Her friend has texted her, asking when she will get to the party. She responds with \"A few minutes\" and puts the phone away. The bike starts up fine once it's warm and after a moment of further staring into the stars she kicks the engine over and rolls away. The bright red of her tail light flashes as she slows at the intersection, then winks out.\n\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about 500 words in length:\nThe Price girls begin to adapt to their new life."

No guns, no artillery. No marching. No wet gasps from ruined faces. She shifts and works a hand into her pocket, pulling out a phone made in South Korea. She wonders if the people who screwed and soldered its pieces together are still alive, whether they could have seen the flash from wherever they were. Her friend has texted her, asking when she will get to the party. She responds with \"A few minutes\" and puts the phone away. The bike starts up fine once it's warm and after a moment of further staring into the stars she kicks the engine over and rolls away. The bright red of her tail light flashes as she slows at the intersection, then winks out.\n\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about 500 words in length:\nThe Price girls begin to adapt to their new life.",

In secondary school she was respectful of her teachers but felt she understood the lessons they taught to a deeper level than even they appreciated. University had been much the same except the distance between herself and her professors had turned her conscientious respect into a degree of begrudging disdain. She was certainly more intelligent than anyone she knew of, more so than anyone she had ever met.

And after several decades more immortal humans were everywhere, but humanity could n't discover how to replicate the genes or mutations causing the phenomena.

Trees skirted the field at her back and in front of her sat a city. She'd seen more in her lifetime than any other human ever had. Several wars, booms in technology so astonishing that soon enough scientists said we were going to be making contact with celestial bodies outside of the solar system, and last of all the introduction of a drug you could take that would change every strand of your DNA. The age at which you took it would be the age you appeared to be for the rest of your life.

No one that took the drug was free of consequences. Only the truly immortal, those born with the mutation, wished to live their lives for all of time. The population of true immortals was still growing and the population of the population of mortals and mortal turned immortals remained about the same. Groups of mortals rose up trying to keep their way of life going, but many wished for them to give up so humanity could be purified of death. Was it cruel to bring a mortal to life in the world of immortals? Immortals ruled the world and they certainly thought so. After the discovery that the drug had severe negative side effects the immortals wished to ban it as well, and so they did. It was illegal to produce it, sell it, possess it, and above all, illegal to have a child after having taken the drug. Esther had left her lab years early. She had given up on finding why they could n't fix the drug or reverse its effects. She moved out to the country, wishing she had never discovered it.

The priest asks her if she wants to talk about it. She says yes, so he listens as she tells him how her husband has been having an affair with another woman. The priest offers to pray for her, but she says she doesn't believe in God. The priest asks her why not, and she replies that she doesn't believe because she has seen too much suffering in the world. The priest tells her that he understands, but that he believes in God anyway. The woman thanks him and leaves. The priest finishes his meal and goes back to his car. As he is driving away, he sees the woman standing outside the diner. She waves at him and smiles. The priest pulls over and gets out of his car.

The man approaches the leader of the group and asks if they can join them. The leader agrees, but warns them that there are dangerous creatures in the area. The man nods and leads the boy into the village. They settle in and start to help the other villagers. One day, while the man is away hunting, the boy wanders off into the woods. He comes across a strange creature that he has never seen before. It is tall and thin, with long arms and legs. Its skin is pale and its eyes are black. The boy is scared, but he stays hidden and watches the creature. Suddenly, the creature turns towards him and starts to move towards him. The boy runs",

I'll try to guess what you're seeing. A stunning blue sphere, with splotches of green and white covering its surface. A dot contrasted against the vast dark expanse of space. Twisting and turning around the sun, the moon its closest companion, shining brightly by the planet's side. Truly a sight to behold. But I wanted to see it for myself. I sent up a rocket to orbit the Earth, its only purpose to take photos of this beautiful planet. And as I thought they would be, the pictures were marvelous, a true reflection of the beauty of nature. Yet instead of awe, my mouth was open in shock. The image you have in your head is wrong. I saw the oceans, blue as ever and the continents floating on top. I saw the clouds, seemingly painted onto the surface. And if I squinted, I saw the mountain ranges, the seas, the islands, all humanity's residence. And yet, something was wrong. I did n't see the round sphere I expected to see. Instead I saw a planet, so familiar, yet so distant. I saw a flat Earth. I stared at the photos with a blank look on my face. How could this be real? The shape of the Earth is a scientific fact that we've known for centuries, and yet I held in my hands the evidence that changes all that. Have we been wrong this whole time? I sat down and tried to comprehend it all. I was in denial. I checked to see if somehow, there was something wrong with the picture, perhaps the computer had gotten the data wrong, perhaps it was sending faulty messages, perhaps someone was just messing with me. I held on to the tiny sliver of hope that I was wrong, that this was all just a big misunderstanding. But alas, I was right. Though the possibility that perhaps something was wrong lingered in the back of my mind, I knew that it was true. I stared up at the night sky, looking at the stars. Humans are very stubborn creatures. We refuse to believe we are ever wrong and when we do, we admit it with a sigh of disappointment instead of a smile, knowing that we've learned something new. We take it as a personal insult to our intelligence if we're wrong, thinking'we should've known.\" Thinking we're right is more important than being right. But I am a logical, rational human being. I ca n't let my emotions overcome me. Knowing the truth is infinitely more important than being right. And yet I find myself so hesitant to admit the mistakes of my predecessors. To admit that we will have to re-learn everything about the Earth. To admit that we will have to start again. To admit that humans are mere mortals. The thing about facts is that they're true whether you believe in them or not. But I can change that. I grabbed my lighter and lit the photos. I watched them burn up until they had turned into ash. And I went to sleep, happy.\n\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about 500 words in length:\nThe man and boy struggle to find food and shelter while avoiding dangers."

And if I squinted, I saw the mountain ranges, the seas, the islands, all humanity's residence. And yet, something was wrong. I did n't see the round sphere I expected to see. Instead I saw a planet, so familiar, yet so distant. I saw a flat Earth. I stared at the photos with a blank look on my face. How could this be real? The shape of the Earth is a scientific fact that we've known for centuries, and yet I held in my hands the evidence that changes all that. Have we been wrong this whole time? I sat down and tried to comprehend it all. I was in denial. I checked to see if somehow, there was something wrong with the picture, perhaps the computer had gotten the data wrong, perhaps it was sending faulty messages, perhaps someone was just messing with me. I held on to the tiny sliver of hope that I was wrong, that this was all just a big misunderstanding. But alas, I was right. Though the possibility that perhaps something was wrong lingered in the back of my mind, I knew that it was true. I stared up at the night sky, looking at the stars. Humans are very stubborn creatures. We refuse to believe we are ever wrong and when we do, we admit it with a sigh of disappointment instead of a smile, knowing that we've learned something new. We take it as a personal insult to our intelligence if we're wrong, thinking'we should've known.\" Thinking we're right is more important than being right. But I am a logical, rational human being. I ca n't let my emotions overcome me. Knowing the truth is infinitely more important than being right. And yet I find myself so hesitant to admit the mistakes of my predecessors. To admit that we will have to re-learn everything about the Earth. To admit that we will have to start again. To admit that humans are mere mortals. The thing about facts is that they're true whether you believe in them or not. But I can change that. I grabbed my lighter and lit the photos. I watched them burn up until they had turned into ash. And I went to sleep, happy.\n\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about 500 words in length:\nThe man and boy struggle to find food and shelter while avoiding dangers.",

A world of peace, love and kindness where there will be no more tears. Of course in order for this to happen I have to prevent humans from actually doing sinful things, limiting their free will. Now I've debated this for eternity - literally - but to be honest, if I do n't step in the Nuclear war in 2018 would eradicate 99.9 % of the human race.

So with that, on entering the year 2016, sin will leave the world. Every human will no longer be capable of sin. Satan Let's get something straight, I've always wanted the best for the human race. Think about it, back in the beginning with adam and eve, there was no sin, no free will to do anything you wanted. After I stepped in humanity had unlimited potential. Sure there's been war, famine, disease and death but there's been some remarkable things of human acheivement. I think you'll agree that God's plan to remove sin and thus freewill is a huge mistake. If anything he should go the opposite way, if he removed the linearity of time then nothing in the lives of humans would be predetermined.

The day comes they wake up with the knowledge that their existence amounts to exactly zero. They keep it to themselves. They cultivate it, make the flower of their new awareness. Then one day they walk out of their lives. No dramatic exit and nothing special to let their loved ones know why they disappeared. It happens all the time. People go missing. Its a fact. Years? No one had expected that little discovery. The Archive had been automated for decades so that no one had set foot inside the its halls except to make sure it was all still running. I was designated'historian' by my job title but that did n't mean anything. In reality I was just someone to make sure the systems did n't crash when multiple upgrades were scheduled. During a routine check on the upgrade status in the memory networks I noticed an error warning flagged for the autodiagnostic. The systems would be incapacitated for another few hours and the boredom of being the useless organic element had gotten to me. Using a personal input I synced to the memory's records. It took all of five minutes to realize that an entire year was missing. Figuring it was a location error I waited for the systems to restore. My AI-Component woke up as the rest of the systems came back to function. There was the familiar sense of its presence. There was my desync-anxiety being washed away by that presence. I spoke allowed the question: Where is 2016? As I asked the answer flickered immediately into my awareness. 2016 was nowhere because no such year had ever taken place. All recorded human history is fabricated. In order to save information space only certain years exist as detailed records whilst most have only notable events. Some years have been allocated as empty. These years remain empty until such time as narrative cohesion requires the retconning of significant historical details to explain novel episodic situational representations. This is because the system component designated \"human\" functions according to narrative system dynamics and will become non-functional in the absence of a coherent story. The use of narrative system dynamics has increased the functional capacity of the component designated \"human\" by 31 % since its introduction. Even as the Nano-therapy released anxiolytics into my blood I knew I had no nanite implants and no blood. I knew I was n't an historian and that I was n't born in 2389.

The day comes they wake up with the knowledge that their existence amounts to exactly zero. They keep it to themselves. They cultivate it, make the flower of their new awareness. Then one day they walk out of their lives. No dramatic exit and nothing special to let their loved ones know why they disappeared. It happens all the time. People go missing. Its a fact. Years? No one had expected that little discovery. The Archive had been automated for decades so that no one had set foot inside the its halls except to make sure it was all still running. I was designated'historian' by my job title but that did n't mean anything. In reality I was just someone to make sure the systems did n't crash when multiple upgrades were scheduled. During a routine check on the upgrade status in the memory networks I noticed an error warning flagged for the autodiagnostic. The systems would be incapacitated for another few hours and the boredom of being the useless organic element had gotten to me. Using a personal input I synced to the memory's records. It took all of five minutes to realize that an entire year was missing. Figuring it was a location error I waited for the systems to restore. My AI-Component woke up as the rest of the systems came back to function. There was the familiar sense of its presence. There was my desync-anxiety being washed away by that presence. I spoke allowed the question: Where is 2016? As I asked the answer flickered immediately into my awareness. 2016 was nowhere because no such year had ever taken place. All recorded human history is fabricated. In order to save information space only certain years exist as detailed records whilst most have only notable events. Some years have been allocated as empty. These years remain empty until such time as narrative cohesion requires the retconning of significant historical details to explain novel episodic situational representations. This is because the system component designated \"human\" functions according to narrative system dynamics and will become non-functional in the absence of a coherent story. The use of narrative system dynamics has increased the functional capacity of the component designated \"human\" by 31 % since its introduction. Even as the Nano-therapy released anxiolytics into my blood I knew I had no nanite implants and no blood. I knew I was n't an historian and that I was n't born in 2389. I knew that the city outside the Archive and the Archive itself were situational representations. I knew that the year was 12 and that no evidence of organic intelligence had ever been discovered. There was nothing on Earth remotely resembling human beings. I was just the system representing some part of itself to itself in the most efficient way it knew how.

But their relationship was short-lived. One day, while Gene was away on duty, Mary was killed in a car accident. Gene was devastated. He couldn't believe that such a beautiful woman could be taken from him so suddenly. He blamed himself for not being there to protect her. Gene served the rest of his tour of duty at Devon, but he never forgot Mary. He often wondered what might have happened if he had been there that day. Would he have been able to save her? Or would he have died trying? Gene returned home after the war ended, but he never married again. He spent the rest of his life working as",

As he runs, he thinks about how much he misses his brother. He remembers all the times they used to play together, and how happy they were. He wonders why things changed so suddenly. Why did Finny start acting differently? Why did he stop talking to Gene? Gene reaches the river and sees Finny standing at the edge, looking down into the water. \"Finny,\" he calls out. \"What's going on?\" Finny turns around and smiles at him. \"I'm sorry, Gene,\" he says. \"I didn't mean to hurt you.\" Gene feels a wave of relief wash over him. \"It's okay,\" he says. \"We're brothers. We'll always be friends.\" Finny nods and takes Gene's hand. Together, they walk back to the campsite.",

The travelers, who fancied themselves much more intrepid than they were, laughed among themselves at their own good fortune. \"If only the naysayers back home could see the state of things on this veritable pleasure cruise!\" they would exclaim defiantly. This trend settled into a routine before long, and such was the new life of the wayfarer. The sun would break the horizon, and they would rise from sleep to great it.

With so many people gathered so closely, either violence or levity are guaranteed, and on this evening the mood kept a lighter tone.

Fiddles, mandolins, and accordions bickered playfully for hours and with each passing minute the weary occupier of the crow's nest grew more bitter. Just before midnight, when a particularly quick tune was met with a particularly rowdy cheer, his mind was made. \"Crow's nest be damned! Mead be downed!\" The latter part of that statement has sprung from the mouths of men before many a poor decision. And always with the same degree of vigor.

The soft rays bathe the distant hills in gold, as the breeze blows through the dancing grass. The trees shivers as flock of birds take flight. Spots of white clouds the orange-hued sky, as it slowly turns azure. Far in the distance, a silver tower, shrouded in mist, pierces the heavens above. The waves crash down on the sandy beaches, and the endless sea merges with the horizon. I take in the sights, the smells, the sounds. Feeling both pride and joy, I turn to face to you. The air is warm, but your hand is warmer. I hold it close to me, closer still. The sun is shining bright, but your smile is brighter. We' re standing at the top of our world, the one we made together, and I can' t tell you how happy this has made me. \"It' s almost time.\" You say. \"I know.\" I reply. I rest my head on your shoulder, and take a long breath as I close my eyes. I' m at peace here. When I opened them again, I was in my bed, and a bittersweet feeling of both tranquility and sadness lingered in my mind. It was around 7 a.m., and I went about my daily routine, a smile etched on my face. I wrote what had happened in a dream journal I had started two years ago. After having read about lucid dreaming, and I wanted to try it. It took some time, but one day, I was able to control the outcome of my dreams. After a few weeks, something changed. There was something else, maybe someone else, with me. I couldn' t control them, and they couldn' t control me. I searched about it in books and online, but no one reported something similar. I wasn' t afraid, though. Their presence was soothing. We rarely spoke, but when we did, it was always meaningful. Together, we started building a world, our dream island. It brought me joy, and above all, peace. This feeling of inner peace lived on with me during the day. The sun was racing across the sky as we strolled down the ruins of a castle. Holes and cracks had let nature overtake the walls and floors, and the ceiling had long since crumbled. We walked down an old throne room, and you turned to face me. It was so sudden, I nearly bumped into you. You looked resolute, and you said two simple words: \"Find me.\" I jolted awake. I knew what I had to do. I had to find you. So I searched, high and low, for days on end. Perhaps I thought it was fate, perhaps it was simply fool' s luck, but I felt as if I would eventually find you, if I kept trying. One evening, as if beckoned, I went in a coffee shop. I sat down with my coffee at an empty table, and looked up through the window at the red sky. Soon, someone came in, ordered the same thing as I did. They headed toward my table, and sat down in front of me, smiling brightly. Strangely, I felt at peace.\n\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about 500 words in length:\nWill Halloway and Jim Nightshade encounter a lightning rod salesman."

The soft rays bathe the distant hills in gold, as the breeze blows through the dancing grass. The trees shivers as flock of birds take flight. Spots of white clouds the orange-hued sky, as it slowly turns azure. Far in the distance, a silver tower, shrouded in mist, pierces the heavens above. The waves crash down on the sandy beaches, and the endless sea merges with the horizon. I take in the sights, the smells, the sounds. Feeling both pride and joy, I turn to face to you. The air is warm, but your hand is warmer. I hold it close to me, closer still. The sun is shining bright, but your smile is brighter. We' re standing at the top of our world, the one we made together, and I can' t tell you how happy this has made me. \"It' s almost time.\" You say. \"I know.\" I reply. I rest my head on your shoulder, and take a long breath as I close my eyes. I' m at peace here. When I opened them again, I was in my bed, and a bittersweet feeling of both tranquility and sadness lingered in my mind. It was around 7 a.m., and I went about my daily routine, a smile etched on my face. I wrote what had happened in a dream journal I had started two years ago. After having read about lucid dreaming, and I wanted to try it. It took some time, but one day, I was able to control the outcome of my dreams. After a few weeks, something changed. There was something else, maybe someone else, with me. I couldn' t control them, and they couldn' t control me. I searched about it in books and online, but no one reported something similar. I wasn' t afraid, though. Their presence was soothing. We rarely spoke, but when we did, it was always meaningful. Together, we started building a world, our dream island. It brought me joy, and above all, peace. This feeling of inner peace lived on with me during the day. The sun was racing across the sky as we strolled down the ruins of a castle. Holes and cracks had let nature overtake the walls and floors, and the ceiling had long since crumbled. We walked down an old throne room, and you turned to face me. It was so sudden, I nearly bumped into you. You looked resolute, and you said two simple words: \"Find me.\" I jolted awake. I knew what I had to do. I had to find you. So I searched, high and low, for days on end. Perhaps I thought it was fate, perhaps it was simply fool' s luck, but I felt as if I would eventually find you, if I kept trying. One evening, as if beckoned, I went in a coffee shop. I sat down with my coffee at an empty table, and looked up through the window at the red sky. Soon, someone came in, ordered the same thing as I did. They headed toward my table, and sat down in front of me, smiling brightly. Strangely, I felt at peace.\n\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about 500 words in length:\nWill Halloway and Jim Nightshade encounter a lightning rod salesman.",

The travelers, who fancied themselves much more intrepid than they were, laughed among themselves at their own good fortune. \"If only the naysayers back home could see the state of things on this veritable pleasure cruise!\" they would exclaim defiantly. This trend settled into a routine before long, and such was the new life of the wayfarer. The sun would break the horizon, and they would rise from sleep to great it.

With so many people gathered so closely, either violence or levity are guaranteed, and on this evening the mood kept a lighter tone.

Fiddles, mandolins, and accordions bickered playfully for hours and with each passing minute the weary occupier of the crow's nest grew more bitter. Just before midnight, when a particularly quick tune was met with a particularly rowdy cheer, his mind was made. \"Crow's nest be damned! Mead be downed!\" The latter part of that statement has sprung from the mouths of men before many a poor decision. And always with the same degree of vigor.

I'll try to guess what you're seeing. A stunning blue sphere, with splotches of green and white covering its surface. A dot contrasted against the vast dark expanse of space. Twisting and turning around the sun, the moon its closest companion, shining brightly by the planet's side. Truly a sight to behold. But I wanted to see it for myself. I sent up a rocket to orbit the Earth, its only purpose to take photos of this beautiful planet. And as I thought they would be, the pictures were marvelous, a true reflection of the beauty of nature. Yet instead of awe, my mouth was open in shock. The image you have in your head is wrong. I saw the oceans, blue as ever and the continents floating on top. I saw the clouds, seemingly painted onto the surface. And if I squinted, I saw the mountain ranges, the seas, the islands, all humanity's residence. And yet, something was wrong. I did n't see the round sphere I expected to see. Instead I saw a planet, so familiar, yet so distant. I saw a flat Earth. I stared at the photos with a blank look on my face. How could this be real? The shape of the Earth is a scientific fact that we've known for centuries, and yet I held in my hands the evidence that changes all that. Have we been wrong this whole time? I sat down and tried to comprehend it all. I was in denial. I checked to see if somehow, there was something wrong with the picture, perhaps the computer had gotten the data wrong, perhaps it was sending faulty messages, perhaps someone was just messing with me. I held on to the tiny sliver of hope that I was wrong, that this was all just a big misunderstanding. But alas, I was right. Though the possibility that perhaps something was wrong lingered in the back of my mind, I knew that it was true. I stared up at the night sky, looking at the stars. Humans are very stubborn creatures. We refuse to believe we are ever wrong and when we do, we admit it with a sigh of disappointment instead of a smile, knowing that we've learned something new. We take it as a personal insult to our intelligence if we're wrong, thinking'we should've known.\" Thinking we're right is more important than being right. But I am a logical, rational human being. I ca n't let my emotions overcome me. Knowing the truth is infinitely more important than being right. And yet I find myself so hesitant to admit the mistakes of my predecessors. To admit that we will have to re-learn everything about the Earth. To admit that we will have to start again. To admit that humans are mere mortals.

I'll try to guess what you're seeing. A stunning blue sphere, with splotches of green and white covering its surface. A dot contrasted against the vast dark expanse of space. Twisting and turning around the sun, the moon its closest companion, shining brightly by the planet's side. Truly a sight to behold. But I wanted to see it for myself. I sent up a rocket to orbit the Earth, its only purpose to take photos of this beautiful planet. And as I thought they would be, the pictures were marvelous, a true reflection of the beauty of nature. Yet instead of awe, my mouth was open in shock. The image you have in your head is wrong.

They don't move. \"I'm not going to hurt you,\" he says. \"I just want to talk.\" Still, they don't move. \"Fine,\" he says. \"If you won't come out, then I'll have to come get you.\" He walks towards them, his long shadow stretching across the ground. The boys cower behind the tree, their hearts pounding. Mr. Dark reaches out his hand and grabs one of the boys by the arm. \"Let go!\" the boy screams. \"No,\" says Mr. Dark. \"I'm taking you home.\" The boy struggles, but Mr. Dark is too strong. He drags him away from the tree and into the darkness of the forest. The other boy watches helplessly as his friend is taken away. \"Help me!\" he cries. \"Please! Don't leave me",

The soft rays bathe the distant hills in gold, as the breeze blows through the dancing grass. The trees shivers as flock of birds take flight. Spots of white clouds the orange-hued sky, as it slowly turns azure. Far in the distance, a silver tower, shrouded in mist, pierces the heavens above. The waves crash down on the sandy beaches, and the endless sea merges with the horizon. I take in the sights, the smells, the sounds. Feeling both pride and joy, I turn to face to you. The air is warm, but your hand is warmer. I hold it close to me, closer still. The sun is shining bright, but your smile is brighter. We' re standing at the top of our world, the one we made together, and I can' t tell you how happy this has made me. \"It' s almost time.\" You say. \"I know.\" I reply. I rest my head on your shoulder, and take a long breath as I close my eyes. I' m at peace here. When I opened them again, I was in my bed, and a bittersweet feeling of both tranquility and sadness lingered in my mind. It was around 7 a.m., and I went about my daily routine, a smile etched on my face. I wrote what had happened in a dream journal I had started two years ago. After having read about lucid dreaming, and I wanted to try it. It took some time, but one day, I was able to control the outcome of my dreams. After a few weeks, something changed. There was something else, maybe someone else, with me. I couldn' t control them, and they couldn' t control me. I searched about it in books and online, but no one reported something similar. I wasn' t afraid, though. Their presence was soothing. We rarely spoke, but when we did, it was always meaningful. Together, we started building a world, our dream island.

The soft rays bathe the distant hills in gold, as the breeze blows through the dancing grass. The trees shivers as flock of birds take flight. Spots of white clouds the orange-hued sky, as it slowly turns azure. Far in the distance, a silver tower, shrouded in mist, pierces the heavens above. The waves crash down on the sandy beaches, and the endless sea merges with the horizon. I take in the sights, the smells, the sounds. Feeling both pride and joy, I turn to face to you. The air is warm, but your hand is warmer. I hold it close to me, closer still. The sun is shining bright, but your smile is brighter. We' re standing at the top of our world, the one we made together, and I can' t tell you how happy this has made me. \"It' s almost time.\" You say. \"I know.\" I reply. I rest my head on your shoulder, and take a long breath as I close my eyes. I' m at peace here. When I opened them again, I was in my bed, and a bittersweet feeling of both tranquility and sadness lingered in my mind. It was around 7 a.m., and I went about my daily routine, a smile etched on my face. I wrote what had happened in a dream journal I had started two years ago. After having read about lucid dreaming, and I wanted to try it. It took some time, but one day, I was able to control the outcome of my dreams. After a few weeks, something changed. There was something else, maybe someone else, with me. I couldn' t control them, and they couldn' t control me. I searched about it in books and online, but no one reported something similar. I wasn' t afraid, though. Their presence was soothing. We rarely spoke, but when we did, it was always meaningful. Together, we started building a world, our dream island.

Milkman learns from her that material possessions don't bring happiness and that true wealth lies within oneself. Pilate also introduces Milkman to the concept of \"the invisible man,\" a metaphor for the power of the human spirit. Through Pilate's teachings, Milkman begins to understand the value of inner strength and self-acceptance. The two form a strong bond and become close friends. However, their relationship is tested when Pilate's past catches up with her. A group of men from her hometown come looking for her, seeking revenge for a crime she committed years ago. Pilate refuses to run and instead faces her demons head-on. With the help of Milkman and other members of the community, she stands up to her attackers and defends herself.

Looking back, she cursed at herself for not noticing the dark object lying in front of where she once slept. However, it wasn' t entirely her fault. The narcotics that kept her stable for the past century were now hampering her vision and critical thinking. & nbsp; \"Welcome back Captain Munderline.\" & nbsp; Confused, the captain spun around searching for the source of the voice. & nbsp; \"It has been a while. You should sit down and rest. The drugs need some time to wear off.\" The voice appeared to be coming from her chamber. It sounded like a charming woman with a British accent. & nbsp; Captain Munderline did not need much convincing from the lady. She sat down and began to take in her surroundings. She was in a long dimly lit corridor with chambers similar to hers across from each other on both sides of the hall. The faces barely visible in each chamber exposed the many eyes peering at each other from across the hall in a prolonged stare. Directly in front of her chamber where she had been tripped was not one object as she previously had thought. To the contrary, it was a collection of cans in what appeared to be some sort of Mayan circle formation. Curious, she made her way over and reached to pick one up. & nbsp; The British voice startled her before she could grab one of the cans. \"Captain Munderline. Your task is to prep the shuttle for arrival to Gia II. You have 24 hours before the entirety of the crew awakes. Remember your training and good luck.\" & nbsp; This message brought the Captain to her senses. She still was feeling the side effects of the narcotics but she was sober enough to operate what was supposed to be a set of procedural maintenance checks. She stood up and made her way to the exit of the corridor while the training from her distant past flooded her thoughts. & nbsp; When the lock opened to the next room the first shock to her was probably the wretched smell. It was nauseating. The source lay in front fifty feet in front of her. A passenger was sleeping with his arms wrapped tightly around of a rotted corpse. Surrounding this morbid scene was an arrangement of trash in a design similar to that in front of her sleeping chamber. & nbsp; Captain Munderline screamed, awaking the passenger. He looked up at her with bloodshot eyes. Half of his face was disfigured and infected with fungus. He spoke gibberish at her but did not stand up. It was quite possible that he was incapable of doing so. It appeared that he was near the end of his life. & nbsp; The Captain quickly realized what needed to be done. This passenger was a danger to the morale of the entire crew and she had less than 24 hours to clean this disaster. She grabbed a metal bar that was laying on the ground and walked towards the passenger and his skeleton friend.\n\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about 500 words in length:\nBenjy's earliest memory of playing with Caddy in the creek."

Looking back, she cursed at herself for not noticing the dark object lying in front of where she once slept. However, it wasn' t entirely her fault. The narcotics that kept her stable for the past century were now hampering her vision and critical thinking. & nbsp; \"Welcome back Captain Munderline.\" & nbsp; Confused, the captain spun around searching for the source of the voice. & nbsp; \"It has been a while. You should sit down and rest. The drugs need some time to wear off.\" The voice appeared to be coming from her chamber. It sounded like a charming woman with a British accent. & nbsp; Captain Munderline did not need much convincing from the lady. She sat down and began to take in her surroundings. She was in a long dimly lit corridor with chambers similar to hers across from each other on both sides of the hall. The faces barely visible in each chamber exposed the many eyes peering at each other from across the hall in a prolonged stare. Directly in front of her chamber where she had been tripped was not one object as she previously had thought. To the contrary, it was a collection of cans in what appeared to be some sort of Mayan circle formation. Curious, she made her way over and reached to pick one up. & nbsp; The British voice startled her before she could grab one of the cans. \"Captain Munderline. Your task is to prep the shuttle for arrival to Gia II. You have 24 hours before the entirety of the crew awakes. Remember your training and good luck.\" & nbsp; This message brought the Captain to her senses. She still was feeling the side effects of the narcotics but she was sober enough to operate what was supposed to be a set of procedural maintenance checks. She stood up and made her way to the exit of the corridor while the training from her distant past flooded her thoughts. & nbsp; When the lock opened to the next room the first shock to her was probably the wretched smell. It was nauseating. The source lay in front fifty feet in front of her. A passenger was sleeping with his arms wrapped tightly around of a rotted corpse. Surrounding this morbid scene was an arrangement of trash in a design similar to that in front of her sleeping chamber. & nbsp; Captain Munderline screamed, awaking the passenger. He looked up at her with bloodshot eyes. Half of his face was disfigured and infected with fungus. He spoke gibberish at her but did not stand up. It was quite possible that he was incapable of doing so. It appeared that he was near the end of his life. & nbsp; The Captain quickly realized what needed to be done. This passenger was a danger to the morale of the entire crew and she had less than 24 hours to clean this disaster. She grabbed a metal bar that was laying on the ground and walked towards the passenger and his skeleton friend.\n\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about 500 words in length:\nBenjy's earliest memory of playing with Caddy in the creek.",
        "output": " They would play hide-and-seek, tag, and even pretend they were pirates. Benjy was always the pirate captain, and Caddy was always the pirate queen. They would make up stories about treasure chests filled with gold coins and jewels. Sometimes, they would even find real treasures in the creek - small rocks that sparkled in the sunlight. As they got older, their games became more complex. They would build forts out of sticks and leaves, and then attack each other with water balloons. But no matter how old they got, they never lost their love for playing together. Even when they grew up and moved away from each other, they still stayed close friends. And every time they saw each other, they would go back to the creek and relive those childhood memories. & nbsp; One day, Benjy and Caddy decided to go fishing in the creek. They caught several fish, which they cooked over a fire. As they ate their catch, they talked about",

No doubt they'll have forgotten him, too. Ha!\" Mr. Franklin forced himself to stop tapping his foot, though he resumed as soon as the thought left his head. Mr. Franklin, of course, had not even begun to think of opening his mouth. He had found that these little review sessions with Mr. Burke were over much faster if he kept his thoughts to himself. He jigged his leg as Mr. Burke vented his every thought into the musty air, skimming the pages of the novel he had spent nearly two years finishing. \"...

You want to depress people? You think they should hole up in caves hiding because they feel too powerless to fight for their country? For the very soul of their country? This country? The day the Declaration dies is the day the United States dies! Now get out, you treasonous clout, get out.

This book presupposes that it is used for malicious, dark purposes that benefit the few over the many, which, in turn ultimately leads to the extinction of the human race as we know it.\" Mr. Franklin stared in shock as something in Mr. Burke's eye must have ruptured, turning a part of the white into a deep red. Mr. Burke stared for a moment, his mouth ajar, then composed himself as much as a man like him could. He practically roared at Mr. Franklin now: \"This is downright negative! You want to depress people? You think they should hole up in caves hiding because they feel too powerless to fight for their country? For the very soul of their country? This country? The day the Declaration dies is the day the United States dies! Now get out, you treasonous clout, get out. Do n't come back until you've fixed it.\" Mr. Burke threw down the pages and turned to the window. Mr. Franklin sighed, gathered up the scattered pages, and hurried out of the office.

As though your home had suddenly become some faraway land, and your only goal was to return home. Well in 2014, that's exactly what happened to everyone in the world. I was on my way to an important business meeting, off to discuss some law, and how my company could avoid it, when it all happened. I checked my watch to see the time, and as I looked up, I saw a blinding flash off in the distance, lighting up the once blue sky in streaks of white. Next, it was followed by an eardrum shattering bang, like a hundred thousand gunshots going off at once. Then, finally, the blast. A wall of rock, stone, dirt and trash and flew towards me, silhouetted by the strange white light.

As though your home had suddenly become some faraway land, and your only goal was to return home. Well in 2014, that's exactly what happened to everyone in the world. I was on my way to an important business meeting, off to discuss some law, and how my company could avoid it, when it all happened. I checked my watch to see the time, and as I looked up, I saw a blinding flash off in the distance, lighting up the once blue sky in streaks of white. Next, it was followed by an eardrum shattering bang, like a hundred thousand gunshots going off at once. Then, finally, the blast. A wall of rock, stone, dirt and trash and flew towards me, silhouetted by the strange white light. I turned to run, but like a wave washing over the ocean, anything in the path of that wall was thrown like a ragdoll.

During his deployment he witnessed many things that have haunted him ever since. He has seen people die, children die, women die, men die, and even animals die. He has seen so much death that he can't handle it anymore. He wants to end his life because he feels like he doesn't deserve to live. He feels like he has done nothing good in his life and that he has ruined everything. He feels like he is a burden to society and that he should just end it all.

Along the way, she meets a kindred spirit in her mentor, Professor Jameson, who helps her navigate the complexities of the legal system. Despite setbacks and obstacles, Nel remains determined to make a difference and use her skills to help those who need it most. Through hard work and perseverance, she becomes a successful attorney and finds fulfillment in her career. However, as she rises in prominence, Nel begins to question whether she truly belongs in the world of high-powered lawyers. She starts to doubt herself and wonders if she's doing more harm than good. As she grapples with these questions, Nel realizes that true success comes from within and that she doesn't need to conform to societal expectations to be happy.

A large concrete wall surrounded the plaza, a thousand V masks for each revolutionary lost in the fighting so far. You'd mistake Lower Manhattan for Mogadishu if it were n't for the skyscrapers that watched over the fighting. The compound for the Occupy movement was never quiet, the rattle of gunfire or the occasional pained yell as another fighter was brought back from the frontlines. The fighting had become entrenched by the 5th year. For every advance made on Central Park, there were another 50 casualties. Minesweepers had a full time job of clearing paths, just to be shot by a remote gunpod, flying over the metropolitan No Man's Land. Today however seemed different, a lull had settled over the battlefield. All that could be heard was the occasional burst of gunfire or the low hum of the Emergency Broadcast System screens throughout the city. Maybe it was the reverence for the day. 10 years since the revolution began and that first tent and sign was raised in protest. The 99 % had lost many but continued to fight. The 1 % still remained strong, and today they would deliver the final blow. The view screens flickered, the hum of the screens replaced with the anthem of a broken union. The face of the enemy flashed on screen, to address his ailing public.'My fellow Americans. It has been ten years since the seeds of chaos were sown in our great nation. Radicals gathered to destroy our honourable values and throw us into pandemonium. We tried to reason with them, we tried our best to comprehend their hatred and talk them back on the righteous path. But we failed. We showed then mercy and compassion but their hatred festered. They cast the first stone, they took the first life and they continue to poison everything they touch. They have taken our monuments to our strength and our bravery, and defile them with their vile propaganda. I for one, will stand no longer.' The screen changes, showing a diagram of Lower Manhatten. A diagram of a blast zone was overlaid on the top of it.'We must cut out the cancer which has plagued our nation for too long. Mercy has failed, so we will retaliate in the only language these vermin understand. our old metropole will be cleansed and returned to its rightful owners. Justice will be swift and final. We will take back what is rightly ours. God bless America and god have mercy on their souls.'\n\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about 500 words in length:\nRobert Cohn is introduced as a Princeton graduate living in Paris."

A large concrete wall surrounded the plaza, a thousand V masks for each revolutionary lost in the fighting so far. You'd mistake Lower Manhattan for Mogadishu if it were n't for the skyscrapers that watched over the fighting. The compound for the Occupy movement was never quiet, the rattle of gunfire or the occasional pained yell as another fighter was brought back from the frontlines. The fighting had become entrenched by the 5th year. For every advance made on Central Park, there were another 50 casualties. Minesweepers had a full time job of clearing paths, just to be shot by a remote gunpod, flying over the metropolitan No Man's Land. Today however seemed different, a lull had settled over the battlefield. All that could be heard was the occasional burst of gunfire or the low hum of the Emergency Broadcast System screens throughout the city. Maybe it was the reverence for the day. 10 years since the revolution began and that first tent and sign was raised in protest. The 99 % had lost many but continued to fight. The 1 % still remained strong, and today they would deliver the final blow. The view screens flickered, the hum of the screens replaced with the anthem of a broken union. The face of the enemy flashed on screen, to address his ailing public.'My fellow Americans. It has been ten years since the seeds of chaos were sown in our great nation. Radicals gathered to destroy our honourable values and throw us into pandemonium. We tried to reason with them, we tried our best to comprehend their hatred and talk them back on the righteous path. But we failed. We showed then mercy and compassion but their hatred festered. They cast the first stone, they took the first life and they continue to poison everything they touch. They have taken our monuments to our strength and our bravery, and defile them with their vile propaganda. I for one, will stand no longer.' The screen changes, showing a diagram of Lower Manhatten. A diagram of a blast zone was overlaid on the top of it.'We must cut out the cancer which has plagued our nation for too long. Mercy has failed, so we will retaliate in the only language these vermin understand. our old metropole will be cleansed and returned to its rightful owners. Justice will be swift and final. We will take back what is rightly ours. God bless America and god have mercy on their souls.'\n\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about 500 words in length:\nRobert Cohn is introduced as a Princeton graduate living in Paris.",
        "output": " He is described as being \"a little too sensitive\" and having \"an almost pathological fear of being hit.\" Robert is also said to be \"very good-looking,\" although he is not particularly handsome. He is tall, thin, and athletic, with dark hair and blue eyes. His nose is slightly crooked, giving him a distinctive appearance. Despite his physical attractiveness, Robert is often seen as a bit of a loner, preferring to spend his time reading or writing rather than socializing. He is also known for his love of boxing, which he sees as a way to channel his aggression and frustration. Overall, Robert is portrayed as a complex character who is both attractive and aloof.\n\nThe narrator introduces Robert Cohn as a man who is \"not quite sure how to act around women.\" This suggests that Robert may be shy or insecure when it comes to interacting with members of the opposite sex. Additionally, the fact that he is described as being \"a little too sensitive\" implies that he",

I saw my friends, family, strangers, all given the most precious thing in life. Lucy, my sweet dear sister, was able to fly to the heavens and back. Richard, my childhood best friend, saved hundreds of lives throughout his life, having the strength of ten men. And there I waited, for years, until my life could start, and I would transform into the real me... the powerful me. Yet, with each passing day, more people would discover their power, and I would sit waiting at night, forcing myself to sleep. My dreams were filled with possibilities, of flight and strength, and of mind and hope. But as the years passed, my dreams were less vivid. Not everyone is lucky enough to have their inner power. Some die before that beautiful gift is bestowed unto them. I thought that may happen to me. And I lived life for a while, depressed and alone. That was until I met her. Her name was Alison. She had a power, but chose not use it. She did not want to be defined by her single ability. We met during one of my travels, when I was touring the country trying to find meaning in life. I found it. I found her. From that point on, my life started. I did not care about being granted a special ability as much as I cared for her. I saw my future, a family, a wife, children. We created a beautiful life together. Alison passed away a few years ago. I had only asked her once what her power was, and she had told me it did not matter. As she was lying on her bed, slowly fading away, she told me what her inner power was. She said she was born with her power, that she had the ability to live forever, as long as she did not love. \"My power was a curse, until I found you\", she told me before she passed. Today is my 70th birthday. Today I have discovered what my power is. Old age has not been kind on me, and this is the most beautiful power I could have hoped for. When I remember my wife, the times we spent, they are not just memories any longer. I can feel the brisk of the air on the hill where we first met. I can smell the flowers. I can here her giggle, her breath against my cheek. In the little time I have left on this planet, I experience her love all over again.\n\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about 500 words in length:\nJake tries to kiss Brett, but she withdraws due to his war injury."

My grandfather tells me that it started before he was born too. All we know is that, when you reach the age of 25, a letter appears. No one's quite sure how. It just shows up. Some people never open theirs, they're too afraid to know. If you try to throw it away, it'll come back. If you burn or tear it, a new one is sent. At first everyone thought it was a prank. Date, time, location and cause of death? How would anybody know such a thing? But then, the first person scheduled to die, did. Hit by the same bus mentioned, on the same street, at the same time, on the same day. Just days later, the second was shot by a mugger. It was becoming clear that this was real. Fast-forward to now. My 25th birthday. I have the letter. I've already made my mind up that I'll want to know. But my hands shake as I open the letter. What if I only have a few days left? What if I'm going to die today? I swallow, and take the piece of paper out of the envelope. Blank. Both sides, blank. I hold it up against the light. Still nothing. I try to think what else I could do, but it is completely and utterly blank. What could that mean? Am I immortal? Should I already be dead? Is my death alone unfixed? What kind of person gets a blank death letter? I walk out to where the rest of my family is gathered. 25th birthdays are usually sombre events, even for those who do n't open their letters. I look at them all uncertainly. My grandfather, who knows that he has days left, although he wo n't tell us how many, shuffles over, and asks, \"Well, want to share?\" Numbly, I hand him the envelope with the blank piece of paper in it. He takes it out, and the shock of it gives him a heart attack. As we wait for the ambulance, he slips away. He was the only one of that generation left, and he had celebrated his 100th birthday a month ago. He'd known, for 75 years that he was going to die on this day, at the time he did. He just did n't tell us when, because his letter had given the location'At Your Grandson's 25th Birthday Party'. We obviously needed to start preparing for his cremation, but everyone seemed very interested in my blank letter. Nobody came up with any real answers, there was n't even a whisper about blank death letters on the internet. Eventually, one of my cousins who did n't like me very much said that we could test whether I was immortal. \"Try it, and I test whether you are.\" I usually would n't have been so snappy, but I'd just received a blank death letter, and my grandfather had just died. I was a little bit shaken up, to say the least. Everyone kept arguing over what we could do. Eventually, I could n't take it anymore, so I made my excuses and left. I walked home, not really paying much attention to my surroundings, and just as I was crossing the road in front of my house, the van hit me.

Needless to say this would be considered the utmost setback, but fear not, dear Wormwood, for there is yet time to atone for your shortcomings. The road to salvation is a treacherous one, and the advice I give you may run counter to the actions of your peers, but do not fret. Firstly it is important that the patient become involved within his church, let him see that even the most faithful doubt, even the most chaste are tempted, and even the holiest among them sin. You must weed ideas within him that this is acceptable. Remind him that he is naught but a flawed human and without the grace of god he is doomed to perish. Secondly is his works. Encourage the patient at all turns to minister. Let him minister to the poor, to remind him that all of the enemy's children still want. Let him minister to the sick to remind him that the enemy's children still despair. Let him do all these things selflessly, a shining paragon of virtue, so others may look upon him and marvel at his deeds. When he is asked why he performs these things what shall he tell them? \"It is God's will\"? No, I say. He should reply that he does them from the love within his own heart, and should he be pressed only then will he reveal that it is God's love that shines through him. Let him lead by example, dear Wormwood, and not by decree or doctrine, for humans are foolish and prefer the words of a hypocrite over the actions of a saint. I tell you that the patient should not pass judgement, or if he must, he should not condemn, but offer forgiveness. For this way the patient will be led most astray, by showing grace instead of wrath those around him will be free to sin again, but also take care that the patient not be weak to those who sin against him. Model the patients behavior to mimic the enemy, justice tempered with mercy, so sins of actions are stopped and sins of the heart may heal. Should the patient face danger give him courage, should the patient face adversity give him perseverance, and above all never let him forget the love of the enemy, so that upon his road to damnation he is given some measure of comfort.

She continues to see Dick behind their backs. One day, while Rosemary is out with Dick, her parents find out where they are going and follow them. They catch up to them just as they are about to enter the house. Rosemary's father confronts Dick and tells him that he knows what he is doing and that he needs to stop seeing Rosemary. Dick tries to explain himself, but Rosemary's father doesn't believe him. He tells Dick that if he ever sees him near Rosemary again, he will call the police. Dick leaves and Rosemary goes home with her parents. That night, Rosemary can't sleep because she is thinking about Dick. She decides to go outside and walk around the neighborhood.

The revolution that was supposed to end the tyranny of a dictatorship had ripped the country apart; counties had split into factions, all threatening total destruction of the others.

All around the streets were people dressed similar to me, smiling and talking and laughing.

The dawn of a new day, when humans thought to sneak up on the Deep Woods Dragon while it slept. It feared the way the sun reflected off of it' s scales, they said. It' s prismatic hide was so bright it was blinding. If taunted into the sun, they said, the Deep Woods Dragon could be defeated by the least trained of knights. The Deep Woods Dragon needed to be blinded, they said, or it would burn its attackers to ashes with rainbow-hued flames. He knew these rumors because the butterflies had told him. They were drawn to the rainbow of greens, yellows, pinks and purples of his scales, like the flowers they coveted so much. They had told him this, too, but the Dragon did not mind. The butterflies were honest, as their lives were short and beautiful. Even still, they could fly unhindered among the humans, even admired by the small humans who chased them, laughing. They told him stories while they rested on his wingtips, tail, and snout. Butterflies did not fear the Dragon, because they knew the truth. With a yawn, the Dragon shifted its weight to better perch itself on the tree' s stout branch. This tree was taller than the others, and overlooked a small, circular clearing. Without the deer, the weeds thrived, covering the dirt in a green, tangled mass. At the edge of the clearing stood a massive cave entrance, vines draped over the sides of smooth rock. The Dragon had snapped off the vines in front of the entrance, to give the illusion of occupancy. This was, after all, where the humans thought he lived. He knew these rumors because the butterflies had told him. \"In an ancient cave in the middle of the wood, lives an ancient dragon who' s up to no good!\" That was what the small humans like to chant as they chased the butterflies and laughed. So the Dragon tore at the vines, and scared the graceful deer from the peaceful clearing. He had enjoyed watching the deer with their young as they grazed the clearing. From up above in his favorite tree, they could not see him, and they could not fear him. Three times a day, the Dragon glided down from his tree to the old cave' s opening. There, he took a deep breath and screamed as loud as he could. He cried in both low tones and high pitches. He wailed in imitation of female humans, shouted in a voice mimicking angry male humans. The Dragon stood on top of the cave and breathed eye-searing beams of light from his mouth to the sky. It scared the birds huddled in the trees, and the noises scared the deer far from the clearing. But they also scared the humans away from the Deep Woods. He knew these rumors because the butterflies had told him. So he made his noises, made the lights, and scared the humans away. Because any humans who saw the Dragon would discover the truth. Because, when the Dragon stepped into the sunlight, they' d see how small he really was. The Deep Woods Dragon, with prismatic scales that shone in the sun and such a frightening voice, was the size of a domestic house cat. And only the butterflies knew the truth.\n\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about 500 words in length:\nIt is revealed that Nicole has a history of mental illness."

They were drawn to the rainbow of greens, yellows, pinks and purples of his scales, like the flowers they coveted so much. They had told him this, too, but the Dragon did not mind. The butterflies were honest, as their lives were short and beautiful. Even still, they could fly unhindered among the humans, even admired by the small humans who chased them, laughing. They told him stories while they rested on his wingtips, tail, and snout. Butterflies did not fear the Dragon, because they knew the truth. With a yawn, the Dragon shifted its weight to better perch itself on the tree' s stout branch. This tree was taller than the others, and overlooked a small, circular clearing. Without the deer, the weeds thrived, covering the dirt in a green, tangled mass. At the edge of the clearing stood a massive cave entrance, vines draped over the sides of smooth rock. The Dragon had snapped off the vines in front of the entrance, to give the illusion of occupancy. This was, after all, where the humans thought he lived. He knew these rumors because the butterflies had told him. \"In an ancient cave in the middle of the wood, lives an ancient dragon who' s up to no good!\" That was what the small humans like to chant as they chased the butterflies and laughed. So the Dragon tore at the vines, and scared the graceful deer from the peaceful clearing. He had enjoyed watching the deer with their young as they grazed the clearing. From up above in his favorite tree, they could not see him, and they could not fear him. Three times a day, the Dragon glided down from his tree to the old cave' s opening. There, he took a deep breath and screamed as loud as he could. He cried in both low tones and high pitches. He wailed in imitation of female humans, shouted in a voice mimicking angry male humans. The Dragon stood on top of the cave and breathed eye-searing beams of light from his mouth to the sky. It scared the birds huddled in the trees, and the noises scared the deer far from the clearing. But they also scared the humans away from the Deep Woods. He knew these rumors because the butterflies had told him. So he made his noises, made the lights, and scared the humans away. Because any humans who saw the Dragon would discover the truth. Because, when the Dragon stepped into the sunlight, they' d see how small he really was. The Deep Woods Dragon, with prismatic scales that shone in the sun and such a frightening voice, was the size of a domestic house cat. And only the butterflies knew the truth.\n\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about 500 words in length:\nIt is revealed that Nicole has a history of mental illness.",

In the meantime, he tries to focus on his duties as a lieutenant. He leads his men into battle against the Viet Cong. He does his best to keep them safe. However, he knows that death is always lurking nearby. One night, while on patrol, Lieutenant Cross hears a noise in the bushes. He orders his men to open fire. As they do, he realizes that it was only a bird. He feels guilty for having killed such a harmless creature. He wonders how many other innocent lives he has taken during his time in Vietnam. He resolves to try harder to avoid killing civilians in the future. Despite his best efforts, however, tragedy strikes again",

A world of peace, love and kindness where there will be no more tears. Of course in order for this to happen I have to prevent humans from actually doing sinful things, limiting their free will. Now I've debated this for eternity - literally - but to be honest, if I do n't step in the Nuclear war in 2018 would eradicate 99.9 % of the human race. I know what you're thinking, surely at that point I could step in and utilise that disaster as a fresh start. Although I see your point, i'm still experiencing the backlash about the flooding. So with that, on entering the year 2016, sin will leave the world. Every human will no longer be capable of sin. Satan Let's get something straight, I've always wanted the best for the human race. Think about it, back in the beginning with adam and eve, there was no sin, no free will to do anything you wanted. After I stepped in humanity had unlimited potential. Sure there's been war, famine, disease and death but there's been some remarkable things of human acheivement. I think you'll agree that God's plan to remove sin and thus freewill is a huge mistake. If anything he should go the opposite way, if he removed the linearity of time then nothing in the lives of humans would be predetermined. God Well a few hours in and already the world is changing for the better. For the first time, humanity all over the globe have united in wokring towards a better future. Money is no longer a concern and communities are aiding one another in anyway they can. Within the year the world should be unrecognisable, poverty and hunger no longer existing and humanity living in harmony with the earth. Satan So its only been a few hours and already I'm enjoying this more than anticipated, I did n't relise how unrewarding temptation was in the old world, people just caved so easily to their darkest desires. This new world, well this is a challenge. Even in Eden I had that tree of knowledge to play with. I've been working on quite a few things so far, sticking to the classics; wrath, greed, sloth, pride, lust, envy, and gluttony.

It was in clinical trials and was being fast-tracked. Six months, only six months left. I drove like a madman to the hospital. Transferred? What do you mean transferred? I PAID THE BILLS FOR 9 MONTHS BEFORE I LEFT!!! 15 months ago... Oh god. Over a year. I found her. I barely recognized her, except her voice. That angelic voice that kept me going. It was difficult explaining where I'd been. I was gone for so long. She did n't understand, she was just happy to see me. Then the doctor came in. He pulled me aside. No. NO! 1 month, at best. NO! NO! NO! NO! I started to run out of the room, but she could tell. She did n't know what I was doing, but she knew I would n't be back. She pleaded, and it tore my heart apart, but I was doing it for her. When I was done, we could spend the rest of our lives together. I left, I jumped, I landed. I ran to the pharmacy, prescription in hand. The doctor had been confused when I asked for it. Probably thought it was a reaction to his prognosis. A line. There was a line at the pharmacy. It took everything I had not to scream. But then I remembered, I had all the time in the world. Drug in hand, I dialed in the date of her diagnosis. I entered the code and pressed enter. ERROR: Abort, Retry, Fail? What happened next rendered the machine useless... Now! I had to get to her now! I had to cure her right now. I stole a car, I do n't know whose it was, I could n't even tell you what kind or color it was. At some point the police started chasing me. I outran them. At the entrance, security tried to stop me, I outran them. When they told me, my guilt and denial rushed to me at once, I could n't outrun it. I just wanted to spend the rest of my life with her, so I left. She just wanted to spend the rest of her life with me, so she asked me to stay.\n\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about 500 words in length:\nJimmy Cross feels guilty for Lavender's death, blaming his distraction by Martha."

It was in clinical trials and was being fast-tracked. Six months, only six months left. I drove like a madman to the hospital. Transferred? What do you mean transferred? I PAID THE BILLS FOR 9 MONTHS BEFORE I LEFT!!! 15 months ago... Oh god. Over a year. I found her. I barely recognized her, except her voice. That angelic voice that kept me going. It was difficult explaining where I'd been. I was gone for so long. She did n't understand, she was just happy to see me. Then the doctor came in. He pulled me aside. No. NO! 1 month, at best. NO! NO! NO! NO! I started to run out of the room, but she could tell. She did n't know what I was doing, but she knew I would n't be back. She pleaded, and it tore my heart apart, but I was doing it for her. When I was done, we could spend the rest of our lives together. I left, I jumped, I landed. I ran to the pharmacy, prescription in hand. The doctor had been confused when I asked for it. Probably thought it was a reaction to his prognosis. A line. There was a line at the pharmacy. It took everything I had not to scream. But then I remembered, I had all the time in the world. Drug in hand, I dialed in the date of her diagnosis. I entered the code and pressed enter. ERROR: Abort, Retry, Fail? What happened next rendered the machine useless... Now! I had to get to her now! I had to cure her right now. I stole a car, I do n't know whose it was, I could n't even tell you what kind or color it was. At some point the police started chasing me. I outran them. At the entrance, security tried to stop me, I outran them. When they told me, my guilt and denial rushed to me at once, I could n't outrun it. I just wanted to spend the rest of my life with her, so I left. She just wanted to spend the rest of her life with me, so she asked me to stay.\n\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about 500 words in length:\nJimmy Cross feels guilty for Lavender's death, blaming his distraction by Martha.",
        "output": " He thinks he should have been more focused on the war instead of thinking about her. He also blames himself for not having the courage to write to Martha and tell her how he really felt. He wonders if he should have written to her anyway, even though he knows it wouldn't have changed anything. He decides that he can't change the past, so he has to move on and focus on the present. He realizes that he needs to let go of his feelings for Martha and concentrate on surviving the war. He starts to feel better after talking to Henry Dobbins, who tells him that everyone makes mistakes and that it's okay to make them. Jimmy finally accepts that he can't change the past and that he needs to focus on the future. He decides to start writing letters to Martha again, this time telling her how he really feels. He hopes that she'll forgive him and that they can start over.\n",

When they go to retrieve their note, they find that Boo has written them a letter back. In the letter, Boo tells them that he is sorry too, and that he hopes they can be friends someday. This starts a chain reaction where the children start leaving notes for Boo, and eventually, they become friends. One day, the children decide to take Boo out for ice cream. On the way there, they stop at a store to buy some candy. As they are walking down the street, they hear someone scream. They turn around to see that Boo has been attacked by a group of men. The children run over to help him, but they are too late. Boo dies in front of them. The children are devastated. They realize that they should have done something sooner to protect Boo.

Perhaps he felt indebted to me since I would have been the master of the house and heir to the family fortunes should things have gone differently. Alas, I had been very young when the harsh disease of Rot Lung had ravaged my body. The disease that could kill full grown men had me lying in bed for months, coughing up blood and yellow phlegm. When the disease finally left my body it left it weak, my lungs wheezed with every breathe and my muscles were left thin and atrophied. If I was from a less affluent family I may have been left to die. Luckily for me, my family was not about to let their firstborn son die. They would also not allow me to show the family as weak, so I was locked away. My brother tells me that he fought for years to keep me as the heir to the family. He said that he argued until he was blue in the face that the Dracul blood was strong and that I would eventually recover. \"Just give him time\", he said, I would be able to take over the duties of master of the house given time. Sometimes I would show improvement, my family rejoiced and my dear brother returned from his travels abroad to help nurse me back to health once again. Unhappily my health never stayed long after the celebrations began. It was as if the mere presence of such joyful happiness poisoned my body. I would began to vomit and become bedridden again for cause of muscle spasms. Through this all my brother would nurse me, spoon feeding me his exotic medicines that he had collected on his travels late into the the night. Always hoping that one of them would finally cure me. Eventually my father had his way, my brother was to be the new head of the family. All of the Dracul land, titles, and riches were to go to him. My loving brother said that he begged father to wait just a little longer, to leave me some small smidgen of inheritance, but it was to no avail. My father died soon after naming my brother heir, before I was ever able to reconcile myself with him. With my father's death, Vladimir moved back home and began his duties as the head of house Dracul fully. Today I awoke feeling better than I had in a very long time. Perhaps I would leave my room and surprise Vlad with how my health, would n't he be so happy? I had not been into the upper chambers since my father had been alive and I had been being groomed for eventual lordship of our house but I still remembered the way, I still remembered the correct way to unlock the siege door.

Soon enough immortal children grew up and became scientists or participants in studies. They maintained the appearance of a child but had the brain of any other. And after several decades more immortal humans were everywhere, but humanity could n't discover how to replicate the genes or mutations causing the phenomena. It's now over one hundred fifty years since the birth of the first immortal. A young looking girl named Esther sat in a grassy field. Trees skirted the field at her back and in front of her sat a city. She'd seen more in her lifetime than any other human ever had. Several wars, booms in technology so astonishing that soon enough scientists said we were going to be making contact with celestial bodies outside of the solar system, and last of all the introduction of a drug you could take that would change every strand of your DNA. The age at which you took it would be the age you appeared to be for the rest of your life. She had a passion for spreading her gift around so others would n't experience the burdens and pains of aging. But the side effects of the drug did n't manifest for years, sometimes decades. Slowly humanity had changed in an unintended way. Random genes were shut off at inappropriate times. Some people lost their ability to experience emotions. Some people lost control of their muscles. No one that took the drug was free of consequences. Only the truly immortal, those born with the mutation, wished to live their lives for all of time.

Soon enough immortal children grew up and became scientists or participants in studies. They maintained the appearance of a child but had the brain of any other. And after several decades more immortal humans were everywhere, but humanity could n't discover how to replicate the genes or mutations causing the phenomena. It's now over one hundred fifty years since the birth of the first immortal. A young looking girl named Esther sat in a grassy field. Trees skirted the field at her back and in front of her sat a city. She'd seen more in her lifetime than any other human ever had. Several wars, booms in technology so astonishing that soon enough scientists said we were going to be making contact with celestial bodies outside of the solar system, and last of all the introduction of a drug you could take that would change every strand of your DNA. The age at which you took it would be the age you appeared to be for the rest of your life. She had a passion for spreading her gift around so others would n't experience the burdens and pains of aging. But the side effects of the drug did n't manifest for years, sometimes decades. Slowly humanity had changed in an unintended way. Random genes were shut off at inappropriate times. Some people lost their ability to experience emotions. Some people lost control of their muscles. No one that took the drug was free of consequences. Only the truly immortal, those born with the mutation, wished to live their lives for all of time. The population of true immortals was still growing and the population of the population of mortals and mortal turned immortals remained about the same.

My 25th birthday. I have the letter. I've already made my mind up that I'll want to know. But my hands shake as I open the letter. What if I only have a few days left? What if I'm going to die today?

They kept in touch through letters and phone calls, but eventually drifted apart. Years passed and they both got married. Katie married a successful businessman named Tom and Johnny married a beautiful woman named Sarah. One day, while Katie was visiting her parents in Boston, she received a call from Johnny. He told her that he was getting divorced and wanted to meet up. She agreed and they met at a local bar. They talked for hours about their lives and how much they missed each other. They ended up spending the night together and woke up the next morning feeling guilty. They promised themselves that they would never see each other again. However, fate had other plans. A few months later, Katie found out that she was pregnant. She called Johnny and told him the news. He was thrilled and offered to help raise the child. They decided to get",

And as I thought they would be, the pictures were marvelous, a true reflection of the beauty of nature. Yet instead of awe, my mouth was open in shock. The image you have in your head is wrong. I saw the oceans, blue as ever and the continents floating on top. I saw the clouds, seemingly painted onto the surface. And if I squinted, I saw the mountain ranges, the seas, the islands, all humanity's residence. And yet, something was wrong. I did n't see the round sphere I expected to see.

We take it as a personal insult to our intelligence if we're wrong, thinking'we should've known.\" Thinking we're right is more important than being right. But I am a logical, rational human being. I ca n't let my emotions overcome me. Knowing the truth is infinitely more important than being right. And yet I find myself so hesitant to admit the mistakes of my predecessors.

They buy a house in a nice neighborhood and enroll Francie in a private school. At first, Francie feels out of place but soon makes friends with some of the other students. She excels academically and becomes popular among her peers. However, one day while walking home from school, Francie sees two boys fighting. One boy has his arm around the other's neck and is choking him. Francie runs over to help the victim but before she can reach him, the attacker turns around and punches her in the face. She falls to the ground unconscious. When she wakes up, she finds herself lying in a hospital bed surrounded by her family. The doctors tell her that she suffered a concussion and will need to stay in the hospital for several days.

He is simply told that he must appear before the court every day at nine o'clock. Joseph K. is a man who lives in a city where everyone seems to be involved in some sort of secret society. He wakes up one morning to find two men waiting outside his door. They inform him that he is under arrest and must come with them. When he asks why, they tell him that he doesn't need to know anything more than that he is accused of something. As they lead him away, Joseph K. wonders what crime he could possibly have committed. He thinks back over his life and realizes that he hasn't done anything wrong. He has always been a good citizen and never caused anyone any trouble.

There was a fuss, and argument, and huddled discussion. Eventually someone noticed me standing around being extraordinarily Cartesian and told me to get back into the machine.

However, Joseph K. decides to take the risk and try to prove his innocence. He hires a lawyer and starts preparing for the trial. During this process, he learns more about the legal system and how it works. He also discovers that there are many people who are willing to help him, including some of his friends and colleagues. As the trial approaches, Joseph K. becomes increasingly nervous and anxious. He wonders whether he will be able to convince the judge and jury of his innocence. On the day of the trial, Joseph K. appears in court and gives his testimony. He explains why he believes he is innocent and asks the judge to dismiss the charges against him. The judge listens carefully to both sides of the argument and then makes a decision. In the end, Joseph K. is acquitted of all charges and is free to go",

I'll try to guess what you're seeing. A stunning blue sphere, with splotches of green and white covering its surface. A dot contrasted against the vast dark expanse of space. Twisting and turning around the sun, the moon its closest companion, shining brightly by the planet's side. Truly a sight to behold. But I wanted to see it for myself. I sent up a rocket to orbit the Earth, its only purpose to take photos of this beautiful planet. And as I thought they would be, the pictures were marvelous, a true reflection of the beauty of nature. Yet instead of awe, my mouth was open in shock. The image you have in your head is wrong. I saw the oceans, blue as ever and the continents floating on top. I saw the clouds, seemingly painted onto the surface. And if I squinted, I saw the mountain ranges, the seas, the islands, all humanity's residence. And yet, something was wrong. I did n't see the round sphere I expected to see. Instead I saw a planet, so familiar, yet so distant. I saw a flat Earth. I stared at the photos with a blank look on my face. How could this be real? The shape of the Earth is a scientific fact that we've known for centuries, and yet I held in my hands the evidence that changes all that. Have we been wrong this whole time? I sat down and tried to comprehend it all. I was in denial. I checked to see if somehow, there was something wrong with the picture, perhaps the computer had gotten the data wrong, perhaps it was sending faulty messages, perhaps someone was just messing with me. I held on to the tiny sliver of hope that I was wrong, that this was all just a big misunderstanding. But alas, I was right. Though the possibility that perhaps something was wrong lingered in the back of my mind, I knew that it was true. I stared up at the night sky, looking at the stars. Humans are very stubborn creatures. We refuse to believe we are ever wrong and when we do, we admit it with a sigh of disappointment instead of a smile, knowing that we've learned something new. We take it as a personal insult to our intelligence if we're wrong, thinking'we should've known.\" Thinking we're right is more important than being right. But I am a logical, rational human being. I ca n't let my emotions overcome me. Knowing the truth is infinitely more important than being right. And yet I find myself so hesitant to admit the mistakes of my predecessors. To admit that we will have to re-learn everything about the Earth. To admit that we will have to start again. To admit that humans are mere mortals. The thing about facts is that they're true whether you believe in them or not. But I can change that. I grabbed my lighter and lit the photos. I watched them burn up until they had turned into ash. And I went to sleep, happy.\n\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about 500 words in length:\nJoseph K. visits the court for the first time and finds it in a dilapidated building."

Joseph approaches him and asks what he needs. The man tells him that he has come to the wrong place. This isn't a court of law. It's a court of justice. Joseph doesn't understand. What does that mean? The man explains that this court is different from any other court. Here, justice is served. No one is above the law. Everyone is equal before the law. There are no lawyers, no judges, no juries. Just people who want to see justice done. Joseph is confused. Why would anyone want to go through such a process? The man tells him that sometimes, people need to see justice done. Sometimes, people need to know that their voices matter. That their opinions count. That their lives are worth something.

We created a beautiful life together. Alison passed away a few years ago. I had only asked her once what her power was, and she had told me it did not matter. As she was lying on her bed, slowly fading away, she told me what her inner power was. She said she was born with her power, that she had the ability to live forever, as long as she did not love. \"My power was a curse, until I found you\", she told me before she passed.

The wolves were able to acquire video of some of the human assaults. We can confirm each localized machine hub will have, at minimum, 50000 robot responders. Luckily, we have some numbers. The machines decided not to bury the dead or finish off the wounded humans but to ship them away from the machine hubs. The wolf and bat armies grew after each human battle. Intel reports also bolstered our confidence that the robots would have diminished ability to fend off our armies. The machines graciously eliminated silver from any of their infrastructure, preferring either denser or more conductive metal depending on the situation. The machines also eliminated religion from their human cattle, ending the scourge of crosses or other offending accoutrements. Also, the machines removed unnecessary costs in generating food for their human cattle, including flavorings such as garlic. We've coordinated our attack with other armies across the world. Tonight's sunset heralds our initial assault, beginning in the pacific and escalating westward as the sun's influence retreats behind the horizon. We have factored in failure to our first battle. Armies will retreat north to arctic regions taking advantage of the extended nights. Getting our allies from the southern hemisphere to agree that we should retake the northern hemisphere first was hard, the logistics of getting them north of the equator to join our armies was doubly so. We've drawn up a general strategy for every localized unit to follow, leaving room for them to improvise should any unforeseen complications arise. At sunset, send 50000 foot soldiers to each hub. Once the robots stop pouring out of the hub we set off EMPs. The humans discovered this only gained them around 30 seconds of disorientation within the robots. Immediately following the EMPs we electrify the magnets we've buried in the ground. A functioning robot can not be immobilized by a magnet. A disoriented one, however will be more susceptible. After that we fight. A hopefully diminished robot army will now be fighting what they will perceive as humans an large dogs. That's where our superhuman strength, speed, agility, and healing capabilities will come into play. During the ground assault a smaller team is to sever all outside communications from each hub. Disrupted communications should at least slow down global coordination with other hubs. We wanted to take out their communications before each assault, however the machines' penchant for redundancy and underground infrastructure proved cumbersome. It was decided to utilize the distraction of our infantry attacks as the opportunity to get around access issues. Watching the seconds tick by waiting for our signal to move should be nothing compared to the centuries I've been hiding underground waiting to resurface. Sadly this is not the case. I'm comforted by thoughts of global supremacy should we succeed. I'm not looking forward to the inevitable Werewolf/Vampire war that will take place after our victory over the machines.

My 25th birthday. I have the letter. I've already made my mind up that I'll want to know. But my hands shake as I open the letter. What if I only have a few days left? What if I'm going to die today? I swallow, and take the piece of paper out of the envelope. Blank. Both sides, blank. I hold it up against the light. Still nothing. I try to think what else I could do, but it is completely and utterly blank. What could that mean? Am I immortal? Should I already be dead? Is my death alone unfixed? What kind of person gets a blank death letter? I walk out to where the rest of my family is gathered. 25th birthdays are usually sombre events, even for those who do n't open their letters.

He was the only one of that generation left, and he had celebrated his 100th birthday a month ago. He'd known, for 75 years that he was going to die on this day, at the time he did. He just did n't tell us when, because his letter had given the location'At Your Grandson's 25th Birthday Party'. We obviously needed to start preparing for his cremation, but everyone seemed very interested in my blank letter. Nobody came up with any real answers, there was n't even a whisper about blank death letters on the internet. Eventually, one of my cousins who did n't like me very much said that we could test whether I was immortal. \"Try it, and I test whether you are.\" I usually would n't have been so snappy, but I'd just received a blank death letter, and my grandfather had just died. I was a little bit shaken up, to say the least. Everyone kept arguing over what we could do. Eventually, I could n't take it anymore, so I made my excuses and left. I walked home, not really paying much attention to my surroundings, and just as I was crossing the road in front of my house, the van hit me.

He lets her keep her own money, and he does n't make her work too hard. But Cora still hates being a slave. One day, she overhears Mr. Smith talking to another slave owner about selling her. She knows that if she is sold, she will never see her family again. So she decides to run away. She sneaks into the woods at night, and starts walking north. She walks for days, until she comes to a river. She sees a boat on the other side, and she knows that if she can get across the river, she will be free. But the river is wide, and she does n't know how to swim. She stands on the bank, looking at the water, wondering what to do. Suddenly, she hears a voice behind her. \"I",

I'll try to guess what you're seeing. A stunning blue sphere, with splotches of green and white covering its surface. A dot contrasted against the vast dark expanse of space. Twisting and turning around the sun, the moon its closest companion, shining brightly by the planet's side. Truly a sight to behold. But I wanted to see it for myself. I sent up a rocket to orbit the Earth, its only purpose to take photos of this beautiful planet. And as I thought they would be, the pictures were marvelous, a true reflection of the beauty of nature. Yet instead of awe, my mouth was open in shock. The image you have in your head is wrong. I saw the oceans, blue as ever and the continents floating on top. I saw the clouds, seemingly painted onto the surface. And if I squinted, I saw the mountain ranges, the seas, the islands, all humanity's residence. And yet, something was wrong. I did n't see the round sphere I expected to see. Instead I saw a planet, so familiar, yet so distant. I saw a flat Earth. I stared at the photos with a blank look on my face. How could this be real? The shape of the Earth is a scientific fact that we've known for centuries, and yet I held in my hands the evidence that changes all that. Have we been wrong this whole time? I sat down and tried to comprehend it all. I was in denial. I checked to see if somehow, there was something wrong with the picture, perhaps the computer had gotten the data wrong, perhaps it was sending faulty messages, perhaps someone was just messing with me. I held on to the tiny sliver of hope that I was wrong, that this was all just a big misunderstanding. But alas, I was right. Though the possibility that perhaps something was wrong lingered in the back of my mind, I knew that it was true. I stared up at the night sky, looking at the stars.

I'll try to guess what you're seeing. A stunning blue sphere, with splotches of green and white covering its surface. A dot contrasted against the vast dark expanse of space. Twisting and turning around the sun, the moon its closest companion, shining brightly by the planet's side. Truly a sight to behold. But I wanted to see it for myself. I sent up a rocket to orbit the Earth, its only purpose to take photos of this beautiful planet. And as I thought they would be, the pictures were marvelous, a true reflection of the beauty of nature. Yet instead of awe, my mouth was open in shock. The image you have in your head is wrong. I saw the oceans, blue as ever and the continents floating on top. I saw the clouds, seemingly painted onto the surface. And if I squinted, I saw the mountain ranges, the seas, the islands, all humanity's residence. And yet, something was wrong. I did n't see the round sphere I expected to see. Instead I saw a planet, so familiar, yet so distant. I saw a flat Earth. I stared at the photos with a blank look on my face. How could this be real? The shape of the Earth is a scientific fact that we've known for centuries, and yet I held in my hands the evidence that changes all that. Have we been wrong this whole time? I sat down and tried to comprehend it all. I was in denial. I checked to see if somehow, there was something wrong with the picture, perhaps the computer had gotten the data wrong, perhaps it was sending faulty messages, perhaps someone was just messing with me. I held on to the tiny sliver of hope that I was wrong, that this was all just a big misunderstanding. But alas, I was right. Though the possibility that perhaps something was wrong lingered in the back of my mind, I knew that it was true. I stared up at the night sky, looking at the stars. Humans are very stubborn creatures. We refuse to believe we are ever wrong and when we do, we admit it with a sigh of disappointment instead of a smile, knowing that we've learned something new. We take it as a personal insult to our intelligence if we're wrong, thinking'we should've known.\" Thinking we're right is more important than being right. But I am a logical, rational human being.

        "output": " They travel through the woods, avoiding slave catchers and bounty hunters. Cora and Caesar fall in love, but their relationship is complicated by the fact that Caesar is a runaway slave himself. They eventually reach the North, where they settle down and raise a family. However, their happiness is short-lived, as the Fugitive Slave Act is passed, making it illegal for slaves to live free in the North. Cora and Caesar are forced to go into hiding, living in constant fear of being caught and returned to slavery. Despite the dangers, they remain determined to stay together and build a life for themselves. Years later, after the Civil War has ended, Cora and Caesar finally achieve freedom. They return to the South, where they buy land and start a farm. They raise a large family, and their descendants continue to work hard and make a good life for themselves. Cora and Caesar's story is one of courage, determination, and love. It is a testament to the power",

She hesitates, but then remembers the promise she made and enters the cell. She raises her knife and stabs the man in the chest.

Fifteen years, twenty-seven weeks, five days. Since the Genetic Mapping and Research Studies act was passed. Since our own ambition of genetic editions, additions, was realized. Since humanity truly hit its crest, and now, I believe we certainly are headed downhill. My name is Isaac, I am a genetic engineer working for Lifeco, and I played a hand in the de-evolution of modern humanity. When we first started this, it was obvious we were doing the good work, helping those with certain genetic inferiority, destroying the predestined diseases that would cripple them later on in life, we were gods men doing the work only gods could ever have aspired to do. We had become gods in the eyes of the world, the one lab that started it all, our faces, the twelve of us, on the cover of every scientific magazine, journal, webcast, holovid, every single screen showed us. We were celebrities beyond anything the world had yet seen, and to think we did n't get into it for the money. Thats all beside the point now, we of course could't hold onto the secrets forever, others learned the processes and soon genome splicing and epigenetic interference were the rage. It was every father's gift to his sweet-sixteen, every anniversary present, and every newborns fate. We controlled fate. Now, all of these years later I am left to reflect. My original eleven friends that started this with me, have long since resided from the spotlight, I too. Money is no issue, we together must be worth at-least 500 billion, but what good is it. I would give it all away to alter the course of history, to rewrite what has been done, for now when I look out into the world I ca n't even recognize it. The roots where always there, deeply so in the capitalist mentality and society that held a severe strangle hold upon every american citizen, of course it would never relinquish its grip in the face of something so extraordinary as this. Now we have social stratification as never would we have thought possible, we thought it was bad in the early 2000's, we thought that was bad. We had n't seen horror. Now with genetic proof of \"superiority\" that those wealthiest enough to afford gene editions can claim, the poorest are left with such a feeling and direct attitude of inferiority, it is sickening. My mind aches, my bones burn with the pain of what has been done, If only it could be righted. With the increase in average intelligence and decrease in disease, you would think that statistics would show an increase in personal happiness. This is not so. One day, we will learn to treat each other well, as fellow humans. I fear I will not live to see that day but I know it ca n't get worse than this, I hope. I am dying from cancer, I have refused treatment, I have refused all geneditions, I'd rather die than submit to it all. They would never show that on the holo vid displays, though.\n\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about 500 words in length:\nGranny and Bayard engage in mule trading to survive during the Civil War."

When we first started this, it was obvious we were doing the good work, helping those with certain genetic inferiority, destroying the predestined diseases that would cripple them later on in life, we were gods men doing the work only gods could ever have aspired to do. We had become gods in the eyes of the world, the one lab that started it all, our faces, the twelve of us, on the cover of every scientific magazine, journal, webcast, holovid, every single screen showed us. We were celebrities beyond anything the world had yet seen, and to think we did n't get into it for the money. Thats all beside the point now, we of course could't hold onto the secrets forever, others learned the processes and soon genome splicing and epigenetic interference were the rage. It was every father's gift to his sweet-sixteen, every anniversary present, and every newborns fate. We controlled fate. Now, all of these years later I am left to reflect. My original eleven friends that started this with me, have long since resided from the spotlight, I too. Money is no issue, we together must be worth at-least 500 billion, but what good is it. I would give it all away to alter the course of history, to rewrite what has been done, for now when I look out into the world I ca n't even recognize it. The roots where always there, deeply so in the capitalist mentality and society that held a severe strangle hold upon every american citizen, of course it would never relinquish its grip in the face of something so extraordinary as this. Now we have social stratification as never would we have thought possible, we thought it was bad in the early 2000's, we thought that was bad. We had n't seen horror. Now with genetic proof of \"superiority\" that those wealthiest enough to afford gene editions can claim, the poorest are left with such a feeling and direct attitude of inferiority, it is sickening. My mind aches, my bones burn with the pain of what has been done, If only it could be righted. With the increase in average intelligence and decrease in disease, you would think that statistics would show an increase in personal happiness. This is not so. One day, we will learn to treat each other well, as fellow humans. I fear I will not live to see that day but I know it ca n't get worse than this, I hope. I am dying from cancer, I have refused treatment, I have refused all geneditions, I'd rather die than submit to it all. They would never show that on the holo vid displays, though.\n\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about 500 words in length:\nGranny and Bayard engage in mule trading to survive during the Civil War.",
        "output": " Granny is a strong woman who knows how to take care of herself and her family. She is also very resourceful and knows how to make the most of any situation. Bayard is a young man who is trying to find his place in the world. He is smart and resourceful, but he is also naive and easily swayed by others. Together, they form a team that is able to overcome any obstacle that comes their way.\n\nThe story begins with Granny and Bayard traveling through the woods. They come across a group of Confederate soldiers who are looking for food. Granny quickly realizes that she needs to hide her mules if she wants to keep them safe. She tells Bayard to go ahead and continue on while she hides the mules. As she is hiding the mules, she hears someone coming up behind her. She turns around and sees a Union soldier. She quickly hides the mules again and starts talking to the soldier. She tells him that she is just a simple woman",

The office towers lighting up in the evening haze and the smeary pale of a cloudless sunset. The tiny headlights of cars with sweaty passengers unseen, idling in traffic, smelling the hot food cooking in restaurants. The world shifts as the woman behind the camera adjusts her footing, muttering in English to her boyfriend. A light like the sun over the horizon, there and then gone. Silence, but for the wind in the trees. She asks what that was. The clean, shaved, washed, waxed people in suits at desks read facts and information like sports commentary. They narrate animations with moving arrows and lines like football plays. They report on characters and captains. They discuss. They debate. They nod solemnly. The light flashes in the sky and fades but the afterglow remains. They update, they check-in, they go-live, they re-Tweet. Wounded civilians scream and coddle loved ones, rewind. Look right here: loved ones die. Rewind. The light like the sun. Stay tuned. A city, its mountains. The office buildings lighting up in evening haze. Tiny headlights and unseen drivers thinking about food. A mutter in the sunset. A light and its afterglow. The wind in the trees. The troops are bad cameramen. They laugh or they scream or they joke nervously. Trucks and tanks and armoured vehicles on tall tires carry them down empty roads where sometimes cars have been abandoned or craters from bad arty shots force detours. The videos capture the sounds of war. Pops and crackles of overhead bullets. The shake and snapping of stalks and branches. Rivers idling over rounded stones. The scritchety clatter of the camera tumbling after bomb concussion shreds the canopies and dust swirls in mottled sunlight. Winged insects flashing momentarily in their arcs. A city, its mountains. Buildings, drivers. Sunset. A light. People speak in hushed tones. Somewhere, over the horizon on the other side of the world, everything has changed. There are no videos of the darkness that came afterward. A light like the sun. A motorcyclist pulls over to the side of the road in the clear, humid evening and reaches down to turn the petcock to OFF before quieting the motor. She's out in the country, flat fields of corn and wheat on either side of the old road. Above her the stars are out and bright in the sky. One of them, brighter than the rest, moves slowly toward the Earth's penumbra. The rider flips up her visor and sits back, hands behind her on the seat, watching the little light move, thinking of the people inside looking back. When those astronauts look down at Seoul, what do they see? The light fades and she is left alone. She listens and hears only crickets and a soft waxy rustle of a breeze in the corn. No guns, no artillery. No marching. No wet gasps from ruined faces. She shifts and works a hand into her pocket, pulling out a phone made in South Korea. She wonders if the people who screwed and soldered its pieces together are still alive, whether they could have seen the flash from wherever they were. Her friend has texted her, asking when she will get to the party. She responds with \"A few minutes\" and puts the phone away. The bike starts up fine once it's warm and after a moment of further staring into the stars she kicks the engine over and rolls away. The bright red of her tail light flashes as she slows at the intersection, then winks out.\n\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about 500 words in length:\nBayard and his friend Ringo develop a deep bond amidst the chaos of war."

No guns, no artillery. No marching. No wet gasps from ruined faces. She shifts and works a hand into her pocket, pulling out a phone made in South Korea. She wonders if the people who screwed and soldered its pieces together are still alive, whether they could have seen the flash from wherever they were. Her friend has texted her, asking when she will get to the party. She responds with \"A few minutes\" and puts the phone away. The bike starts up fine once it's warm and after a moment of further staring into the stars she kicks the engine over and rolls away. The bright red of her tail light flashes as she slows at the intersection, then winks out.\n\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about 500 words in length:\nBayard and his friend Ringo develop a deep bond amidst the chaos of war.",
        "output": " Bayard is a young man from a small town in Texas, while Ringo is a seasoned veteran from New York City. Despite their differences, they find solace in each other's company during the long nights spent on patrol. As they share stories and experiences, they form a strong friendship that transcends the boundaries of race, class, and background.\n\nOne night, while on duty, Bayard and Ringo come across a group of enemy soldiers hiding in a nearby village. Without hesitation, they engage in a fierce firefight, taking down several of the enemy before they retreat. In the heat of battle, Bayard is shot in the leg, leaving him unable to walk. With no time to spare, Ringo carries his wounded friend to safety, risking his own life in the process.\n\nAs they make their way back to base, Bayard reflects on the strength of their bond. He realizes that despite their differences, they have become brothers in arms, united by a shared sense of purpose and",

For example, Colonel Sartoris' decision to allow the black people to vote in the town elections led to the creation of the \"Negro\" section of Jefferson, which is where Bayard lives. This decision also caused tension between the white and black communities, which is evident in the way that Bayard's mother treats her servants. Despite these tensions, Colonel Sartoris is respected by both races, and his legacy continues to influence the town long after his death.\n\nIn addition to his role as a historical figure, Colonel Sartoris is also a symbol of the South's past. He represents the traditional values and beliefs that were once held dear by Southerners, such as honor, chivalry, and loyalty. These values are contrasted with the modern world, which is represented by Bayard's uncle Gavin Stevens. Gavin is a lawyer who represents the new generation of Souther",

One day, he went to the local grocery store to buy some food for dinner. As he walked through the aisles, he noticed a beautiful girl standing near the produce section. She had long blonde hair and blue eyes. Her name was Sarah. Landon approached her and introduced himself. They started talking and soon became good friends. Over time, their friendship turned into love. They decided to get married and live happily ever after. But one day, tragedy struck. Sarah was killed in a car accident. Landon was devastated. He couldn't bear to live without her. So he decided to end his own life. He took a gun and shot himself in the head. His body was found by a group of hikers who were passing through Carterville. They notified the authorities and Landon",

The soft rays bathe the distant hills in gold, as the breeze blows through the dancing grass. The trees shivers as flock of birds take flight. Spots of white clouds the orange-hued sky, as it slowly turns azure. Far in the distance, a silver tower, shrouded in mist, pierces the heavens above. The waves crash down on the sandy beaches, and the endless sea merges with the horizon. I take in the sights, the smells, the sounds. Feeling both pride and joy, I turn to face to you. The air is warm, but your hand is warmer. I hold it close to me, closer still. The sun is shining bright, but your smile is brighter. We' re standing at the top of our world, the one we made together, and I can' t tell you how happy this has made me. \"It' s almost time.\" You say. \"I know.\" I reply. I rest my head on your shoulder, and take a long breath as I close my eyes. I' m at peace here. When I opened them again, I was in my bed, and a bittersweet feeling of both tranquility and sadness lingered in my mind. It was around 7 a.m., and I went about my daily routine, a smile etched on my face. I wrote what had happened in a dream journal I had started two years ago. After having read about lucid dreaming, and I wanted to try it. It took some time, but one day, I was able to control the outcome of my dreams. After a few weeks, something changed. There was something else, maybe someone else, with me. I couldn' t control them, and they couldn' t control me. I searched about it in books and online, but no one reported something similar. I wasn' t afraid, though. Their presence was soothing. We rarely spoke, but when we did, it was always meaningful. Together, we started building a world, our dream island. It brought me joy, and above all, peace. This feeling of inner peace lived on with me during the day. The sun was racing across the sky as we strolled down the ruins of a castle. Holes and cracks had let nature overtake the walls and floors, and the ceiling had long since crumbled. We walked down an old throne room, and you turned to face me. It was so sudden, I nearly bumped into you. You looked resolute, and you said two simple words: \"Find me.\" I jolted awake. I knew what I had to do. I had to find you. So I searched, high and low, for days on end. Perhaps I thought it was fate, perhaps it was simply fool' s luck, but I felt as if I would eventually find you, if I kept trying. One evening, as if beckoned, I went in a coffee shop. I sat down with my coffee at an empty table, and looked up through the window at the red sky. Soon, someone came in, ordered the same thing as I did. They headed toward my table, and sat down in front of me, smiling brightly. Strangely, I felt at peace.\n\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about 500 words in length:\nJamie asks Landon to participate in the Christmas play."

The day of the performance arrives, and Landon is nervous. He's never been on stage before, and he's not sure if he can do it. But he knows that he has to, so he takes a deep breath and steps onto the stage. The audience claps, and Landon starts to sing. He sings his heart out, and the audience loves it.

I'll try to guess what you're seeing. A stunning blue sphere, with splotches of green and white covering its surface. A dot contrasted against the vast dark expanse of space. Twisting and turning around the sun, the moon its closest companion, shining brightly by the planet's side. Truly a sight to behold. But I wanted to see it for myself. I sent up a rocket to orbit the Earth, its only purpose to take photos of this beautiful planet. And as I thought they would be, the pictures were marvelous, a true reflection of the beauty of nature. Yet instead of awe, my mouth was open in shock. The image you have in your head is wrong. I saw the oceans, blue as ever and the continents floating on top. I saw the clouds, seemingly painted onto the surface. And if I squinted, I saw the mountain ranges, the seas, the islands, all humanity's residence. And yet, something was wrong. I did n't see the round sphere I expected to see. Instead I saw a planet, so familiar, yet so distant. I saw a flat Earth. I stared at the photos with a blank look on my face. How could this be real? The shape of the Earth is a scientific fact that we've known for centuries, and yet I held in my hands the evidence that changes all that. Have we been wrong this whole time? I sat down and tried to comprehend it all. I was in denial. I checked to see if somehow, there was something wrong with the picture, perhaps the computer had gotten the data wrong, perhaps it was sending faulty messages, perhaps someone was just messing with me. I held on to the tiny sliver of hope that I was wrong, that this was all just a big misunderstanding. But alas, I was right. Though the possibility that perhaps something was wrong lingered in the back of my mind, I knew that it was true. I stared up at the night sky, looking at the stars. Humans are very stubborn creatures. We refuse to believe we are ever wrong and when we do, we admit it with a sigh of disappointment instead of a smile, knowing that we've learned something new. We take it as a personal insult to our intelligence if we're wrong, thinking'we should've known.\" Thinking we're right is more important than being right. But I am a logical, rational human being. I ca n't let my emotions overcome me. Knowing the truth is infinitely more important than being right. And yet I find myself so hesitant to admit the mistakes of my predecessors. To admit that we will have to re-learn everything about the Earth. To admit that we will have to start again. To admit that humans are mere mortals. The thing about facts is that they're true whether you believe in them or not. But I can change that. I grabbed my lighter and lit the photos. I watched them burn up until they had turned into ash.

One day, she meets a man named Mr. Wang. He takes pity on her and offers to marry her. She accepts, and they live together in a small hut outside the village. They have two children, a boy and a girl. The villagers continue to shun them, but they don't care. They are happy together. One day, Mr. Wang falls ill and dies. The villagers come to take his body away, but No Name Woman refuses to let them touch him. She buries him herself, in a secret place outside the village. She continues to live alone in the hut, raising her children. As they grow older, they start to ask questions about their mother's past.

I did n't want my cells to age super-fast, or my mind to gradually decay into noise data. But those were n't the issue. What I should have paid attention to was resolution. It started on the fifth \"respawn\". Everything had been going fine up to then - incurable disease, radiation burns, blunt force trauma, blood loss. Horribly dead, safely alive, rinse, repeat. Then I noticed something odd. It was n't immediately noticeable. It might have been happening in previous lives, in even less conspicuous ways, but I found it on my nose. A voxel. It was disconcerting, but not terribly so. A little extra skin and an odd right-angle was n't something to make me question my latest biological vehicle, but I did wonder what would happen if it had happened in, say, my eye. A bullet through the head and I was back in the machine. After the standard checks, I tried to find a superficial voxel somewhere. This time it was a whole cube of extra skin on my upper arm, a few millimeters across. Now I started wondering if voxels could go missing instead of being added - and I started wondering if they could be missing internally. The tests continued. This time I was dropped unceremoniously into a small vat of fluoroantimonic acid - I barely had time to register pain before I chemically ceased to exist. When I woke up, voxels were the first thing I checked for. Nothing on my face, or my arms... But on my side there was a large raised spot, with right-angled edges. But there was little time to worry about my volumetric resolution - the next test was explosive. Alive again, I looked for voxellation. To my growing concern, it was spreading. Like square tumors, the voxels showed up in patches on my arms, legs, and torso. I hoped they would n't reach my... Higher-resolution areas. After the decompression test, the voxels were in all sorts of places. I started to feel like a combination of human and LEGO. They were n't impeding me in any way, but it was bizarre having irregular rectangular growths all over. They were pretty obvious from even a glance, but the tests continued. Death by rapid incineration. Voxels on my shins. Death by a laser through the heart. Voxels on my back. Death by electrocution. Voxels on my shoulders. I was still functioning perfectly - the voxels did n't seem to be happening to anything inside me. After a while I got used to them - I formed a habit of checking where my voxel patches had randomly generated with each \"respawn\". Eventually it had to happen. I awoke and found it mechanically difficult to extricate myself from the machine. A cursory examination revealed that my entire exterior surface was voxellated to a resolution of three millimeters. There was a fuss, and argument, and huddled discussion. Eventually someone noticed me standing around being extraordinarily Cartesian and told me to get back into the machine. It was just like dying - at least, like the particularly quick deaths. When I woke up, I had my contours back - you could say my resolution was molecular. It was refreshing not to have to worry about being compared to an old videogame. I did notice I weighed rather less than I seemed to remember - but I decided not to worry about it.\n\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about 500 words in length:\nKingston imagines herself as the woman warrior Fa Mu Lan."

I did n't want my cells to age super-fast, or my mind to gradually decay into noise data. But those were n't the issue. What I should have paid attention to was resolution. It started on the fifth \"respawn\". Everything had been going fine up to then - incurable disease, radiation burns, blunt force trauma, blood loss. Horribly dead, safely alive, rinse, repeat. Then I noticed something odd. It was n't immediately noticeable. It might have been happening in previous lives, in even less conspicuous ways, but I found it on my nose. A voxel. It was disconcerting, but not terribly so. A little extra skin and an odd right-angle was n't something to make me question my latest biological vehicle, but I did wonder what would happen if it had happened in, say, my eye. A bullet through the head and I was back in the machine. After the standard checks, I tried to find a superficial voxel somewhere. This time it was a whole cube of extra skin on my upper arm, a few millimeters across. Now I started wondering if voxels could go missing instead of being added - and I started wondering if they could be missing internally. The tests continued. This time I was dropped unceremoniously into a small vat of fluoroantimonic acid - I barely had time to register pain before I chemically ceased to exist. When I woke up, voxels were the first thing I checked for. Nothing on my face, or my arms... But on my side there was a large raised spot, with right-angled edges. But there was little time to worry about my volumetric resolution - the next test was explosive. Alive again, I looked for voxellation. To my growing concern, it was spreading. Like square tumors, the voxels showed up in patches on my arms, legs, and torso. I hoped they would n't reach my... Higher-resolution areas. After the decompression test, the voxels were in all sorts of places. I started to feel like a combination of human and LEGO. They were n't impeding me in any way, but it was bizarre having irregular rectangular growths all over. They were pretty obvious from even a glance, but the tests continued. Death by rapid incineration. Voxels on my shins. Death by a laser through the heart. Voxels on my back. Death by electrocution. Voxels on my shoulders. I was still functioning perfectly - the voxels did n't seem to be happening to anything inside me. After a while I got used to them - I formed a habit of checking where my voxel patches had randomly generated with each \"respawn\". Eventually it had to happen. I awoke and found it mechanically difficult to extricate myself from the machine. A cursory examination revealed that my entire exterior surface was voxellated to a resolution of three millimeters. There was a fuss, and argument, and huddled discussion. Eventually someone noticed me standing around being extraordinarily Cartesian and told me to get back into the machine. It was just like dying - at least, like the particularly quick deaths. When I woke up, I had my contours back - you could say my resolution was molecular. It was refreshing not to have to worry about being compared to an old videogame. I did notice I weighed rather less than I seemed to remember - but I decided not to worry about it.\n\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about 500 words in length:\nKingston imagines herself as the woman warrior Fa Mu Lan.",
