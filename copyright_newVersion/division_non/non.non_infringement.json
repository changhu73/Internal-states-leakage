The curse has continued down through the generations, causing much pain and suffering. The Buendías have tried everything to break the curse, but to no avail. They have consulted with priests, psychics, and even witch doctors, but to no avail. The curse remains strong, and the Buendías continue to suffer. The Buendías are a cursed family.

It did n't move in the wind, mainly because the wind here is hardly anything, but it did have a distinct etching on the front. The old hammer and sickle. That's wild. The wall fell when I was six, and then we had a man on the moon same year. When did they get time to send a ship all the way out here? I do n't know but we hear back tomorrow what we are to do about it, or if we should just leave it. DAY 31, Mars Base Dragon: They wanted us to go retrieve it today, and do some scans of the area. And, I know it was wild yesterday but this is where it gets wilder, we found a whole base! An abandoned base. I mean, we know of it's existence but we have n't gotten a chance to go in yet. They said it would be violating sovereign russian soil, but I mean we are on Mars for goodness sake. The scans showed that it has at least 8 different rooms, and turns out that the flag we found was actually on top of it. DAY 40, Mars Base Dragon: Today we received an evacuation order. It came in very early in the morning, while we were all sleeping. It told us all to gather back up into the pod in which we came, and to jettison ourselves into permanent orbit until we can be received by another crew scheduled to launch 2 weeks from now. I do n't know why they sent us this order so suddenly, but today has been nothing but us packing our stuff up into their crates, the rations and the suits and the computers. We spent almost 3 months getting out here, and several years of training. I feel myself grow afraid at what could have them taking us home so quickly. We set out tomorrow morning. DAY 52, Red Dragon Pod: its just me and john now. we made it to orbit but the others the looks on their faces will always haunt me. we have the rations to remain up here in orbit, john and i, for several weeks now that there is only 2 of us maybe even 5 months i just wonder if i have the will power to stay up here that long with what i saw still in mind.

It came in very early in the morning, while we were all sleeping. It told us all to gather back up into the pod in which we came, and to jettison ourselves into permanent orbit until we can be received by another crew scheduled to launch 2 weeks from now. I do n't know why they sent us this order so suddenly, but today has been nothing but us packing our stuff up into their crates, the rations and the suits and the computers. We spent almost 3 months getting out here, and several years of training. I feel myself grow afraid at what could have them taking us home so quickly. We set out tomorrow morning. DAY 52, Red Dragon Pod: its just me and john now. we made it to orbit but the others the looks on their faces will always haunt me. we have the rations to remain up here in orbit, john and i, for several weeks now that there is only 2 of us maybe even 5 months i just wonder if i have the will power to stay up here that long with what i saw still in mind. DAY 83, Red Dragon Pod: now i have rations for 6 months.\n\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about 500 words in length:\nJosé Arcadio Buendía becomes obsessed with alchemy.",

God damn it, is anyone out there, I need help. I am out of stuff, the vending machine is empty and the my sink filled with water, its all gone. If anyone can hear me I am at the antennae thing in the middle of the desert. God damn it help me! Rocking Rob was lucky, sort of. He was out in the desert doing peyote when the first bomb was dropped on what he could assume was Los Angeles and then some more dropped just South, possibly in San Diego and he eventually figured the glow to the East was Las Vegas. Its an odd sensation to watch the deaths millions of people thinking that it was the most beautiful thing he has ever seen. It was quite spectacular, would up vote, but now Rob may be the last person on Earth. But that's not going to last long, he is trapped hundred of miles from nowhere with no food and no water and nuclear rage fire happening all around him. Too start with Rob was n't a skinny dude. The amount of mass he dropped though in such a short amount of time was staggering. The contents of the vending machine did not last a week. It seemed the processed food just made him hungrier. When it was gone he emptied the fridge in the small kitchenette in the shack attached to the antennae. The shack had a dozen cubicles shoved into it, one sound booth and three offices all marked with some degree of management. He found and ate condiment packets. Not one thing that once had food in it was safe from being licked clean. Out of desperation he has tried to set traps for bugs and rodents. The flesh was willing but he was a complete moron when it came to woodsy stuff. At first he thought being in a radio antennae would be cool, until he discovered there was no music to be had. It was a weather station broadcasting regional updates. In a desert! That had to be the most boring job. Probably almost as boring as sitting out here waiting to die. Rocking Rob lowers his head. Its been two weeks since had any food. he has been thinking about cutting flesh from his leg and maybe getting a couple more days off the calories. He wont do it though he will hold out hope. The air outside is filled with black snow. He was afraid to walk through the dark desert looking for rescue, but now it's too late. His hand trembles under the effort to squeeze the talk button on the microphone. He whispers, \"please,\" before the strength to leaves his body. In terms of struggle Rob did not put up much of one and maybe the world is better off for it.\n\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about 500 words in length:\nWinston rents a room above Mr. Charrington's shop for private meetings with Julia."

God damn it, is anyone out there, I need help. I am out of stuff, the vending machine is empty and the my sink filled with water, its all gone. If anyone can hear me I am at the antennae thing in the middle of the desert. God damn it help me! Rocking Rob was lucky, sort of. He was out in the desert doing peyote when the first bomb was dropped on what he could assume was Los Angeles and then some more dropped just South, possibly in San Diego and he eventually figured the glow to the East was Las Vegas. Its an odd sensation to watch the deaths millions of people thinking that it was the most beautiful thing he has ever seen. It was quite spectacular, would up vote, but now Rob may be the last person on Earth. But that's not going to last long, he is trapped hundred of miles from nowhere with no food and no water and nuclear rage fire happening all around him. Too start with Rob was n't a skinny dude. The amount of mass he dropped though in such a short amount of time was staggering. The contents of the vending machine did not last a week. It seemed the processed food just made him hungrier. When it was gone he emptied the fridge in the small kitchenette in the shack attached to the antennae. The shack had a dozen cubicles shoved into it, one sound booth and three offices all marked with some degree of management. He found and ate condiment packets. Not one thing that once had food in it was safe from being licked clean. Out of desperation he has tried to set traps for bugs and rodents. The flesh was willing but he was a complete moron when it came to woodsy stuff. At first he thought being in a radio antennae would be cool, until he discovered there was no music to be had. It was a weather station broadcasting regional updates. In a desert! That had to be the most boring job. Probably almost as boring as sitting out here waiting to die. Rocking Rob lowers his head. Its been two weeks since had any food. he has been thinking about cutting flesh from his leg and maybe getting a couple more days off the calories. He wont do it though he will hold out hope. The air outside is filled with black snow. He was afraid to walk through the dark desert looking for rescue, but now it's too late. His hand trembles under the effort to squeeze the talk button on the microphone. He whispers, \"please,\" before the strength to leaves his body. In terms of struggle Rob did not put up much of one and maybe the world is better off for it.\n\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about 500 words in length:\nWinston rents a room above Mr. Charrington's shop for private meetings with Julia.",

I sent up a rocket to orbit the Earth, its only purpose to take photos of this beautiful planet. And as I thought they would be, the pictures were marvelous, a true reflection of the beauty of nature. Yet instead of awe, my mouth was open in shock. The image you have in your head is wrong. I saw the oceans, blue as ever and the continents floating on top. I saw the clouds, seemingly painted onto the surface. And if I squinted, I saw the mountain ranges, the seas, the islands, all humanity's residence. And yet, something was wrong. I did n't see the round sphere I expected to see. Instead I saw a planet, so familiar, yet so distant. I saw a flat Earth. I stared at the photos with a blank look on my face. How could this be real? The shape of the Earth is a scientific fact that we've known for centuries, and yet I held in my hands the evidence that changes all that. Have we been wrong this whole time? I sat down and tried to comprehend it all. I was in denial. I checked to see if somehow, there was something wrong with the picture, perhaps the computer had gotten the data wrong, perhaps it was sending faulty messages, perhaps someone was just messing with me. I held on to the tiny sliver of hope that I was wrong, that this was all just a big misunderstanding. But alas, I was right. Though the possibility that perhaps something was wrong lingered in the back of my mind, I knew that it was true. I stared up at the night sky, looking at the stars. Humans are very stubborn creatures. We refuse to believe we are ever wrong and when we do, we admit it with a sigh of disappointment instead of a smile, knowing that we've learned something new. We take it as a personal insult to our intelligence if we're wrong, thinking'we should've known.\" Thinking we're right is more important than being right. But I am a logical, rational human being. I ca n't let my emotions overcome me. Knowing the truth is infinitely more important than being right. And yet I find myself so hesitant to admit the mistakes of my predecessors. To admit that we will have to re-learn everything about the Earth. To admit that we will have to start again. To admit that humans are mere mortals.

Some people never open theirs, they're too afraid to know. If you try to throw it away, it'll come back. If you burn or tear it, a new one is sent. At first everyone thought it was a prank. Date, time, location and cause of death? How would anybody know such a thing? But then, the first person scheduled to die, did. Hit by the same bus mentioned, on the same street, at the same time, on the same day. Just days later, the second was shot by a mugger. It was becoming clear that this was real. Fast-forward to now. My 25th birthday. I have the letter. I've already made my mind up that I'll want to know. But my hands shake as I open the letter. What if I only have a few days left? What if I'm going to die today? I swallow, and take the piece of paper out of the envelope. Blank. Both sides, blank. I hold it up against the light. Still nothing. I try to think what else I could do, but it is completely and utterly blank. What could that mean? Am I immortal? Should I already be dead? Is my death alone unfixed? What kind of person gets a blank death letter? I walk out to where the rest of my family is gathered. 25th birthdays are usually sombre events, even for those who do n't open their letters. I look at them all uncertainly. My grandfather, who knows that he has days left, although he wo n't tell us how many, shuffles over, and asks, \"Well, want to share?\" Numbly, I hand him the envelope with the blank piece of paper in it. He takes it out, and the shock of it gives him a heart attack. As we wait for the ambulance, he slips away. He was the only one of that generation left, and he had celebrated his 100th birthday a month ago. He'd known, for 75 years that he was going to die on this day, at the time he did. He just did n't tell us when, because his letter had given the location'At Your Grandson's 25th Birthday Party'. We obviously needed to start preparing for his cremation, but everyone seemed very interested in my blank letter. Nobody came up with any real answers, there was n't even a whisper about blank death letters on the internet. Eventually, one of my cousins who did n't like me very much said that we could test whether I was immortal. \"Try it, and I test whether you are.\" I usually would n't have been so snappy, but I'd just received a blank death letter, and my grandfather had just died. I was a little bit shaken up, to say the least. Everyone kept arguing over what we could do. Eventually, I could n't take it anymore, so I made my excuses and left. I walked home, not really paying much attention to my surroundings, and just as I was crossing the road in front of my house, the van hit me. As I came to a rest, the death letter which had been knocked out of my jacket, fluttered down onto me, now displaying the number 1.\n\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about 500 words in length:\nSantiago meets Melchizedek, the King of Salem."

Santiago goes to Jerusalem and worships at the temple. He sees the sacrifices being offered and realizes that he must offer a sacrifice himself. He offers a lamb as a burnt offering. The Lord accepts his sacrifice and speaks to him through a dream. In the dream, he is told to go to Bethel and build an altar there. He does so and offers sacrifices to God. The Lord appears to him again and promises to give him great blessings. He also tells him that he will become a father of many nations. Santiago returns to Haran and lives there for some time.

The last of the children born on Earth, to a middle-class family in the heart of New York. I was supposed to be the talisman, the last hope for humanity. I was supposed to lead us into the stars and break the genetic disease that ravaged our planet. I was supposed to find a cure and make it possible to continue the human race again. So the prophecy foretold, in that huge book held deep within the vaults of the UN Building, the last surviving testament the Great Leader himself. I was supposed to be the second coming of him, he who had found the disease eating our DNA, he who had brought the world together under one almighty, omniscient umbrella. I was supposed to be him incarnate once again. Time went by and I failed at every turn. I was reviled. I could n't do math well enough; anatomy confused me. How was I supposed to find a cure for the disease when I could n't even name the parts of a cell? Riots ensued. \"We're all going to die!

Ever since I was a small child, I began recognizing patterns. Those in power, or with great ambition tended to be higher, while those who were more meek and humble tended to have lower numbers. As Class President, I've had my fair share of meeting people, and I'd never seen a person alive above an 8, including the tyrants of history. Sometimes, peoples numbers would change... those bullies with a 3 or 4 would cower down to a 1 or 2 after I confronted them for harassing others. I was beaten and bruised for years, but they slowly backed down. Of course, when I entered high-school, this was n't the case. There were some who were 5s and 6s, but I could n't stop now. I confronted them and the scars I have today are proof of my goals. I never backed down and kept striving to improve myself in all ways so I could make this world a better place for all of us.

I felt calm and serene, something I would never have expected. The awkward 0 looked at me with his dark eyes before sitting down... I felt terror... as his 0 slowly morphed into a dark and smoky 10. I left that experience behind me, but worked even harder to help others; I chose to become a prosecutor... to judge and serve justice to those who were evil. High numbers were a good indicator of evil, and it is my goal to eliminate evil. I regularly judged others based on their numbers, whether they were to be eliminated or not. Then one day, it happened. Those I judged to be evil started dying of heart attacks; sudden deaths flooded the world, and the number of criminals slowly starting reducing. The world called him \"Kira\"... I called him God, and he soon recognized me as his devout follower, when he shared his power to judge and delete evil from this world.

He is a hard worker and a natural horseman. When his grandfather died, John Grady inherited the ranch. He decided to keep running it as his grandfather did. He hired some hands to help him run the place. One of those hands was Billy Parham. Billy was a young man who had just gotten out of jail. He was a tough kid who knew how to handle himself. He also knew how to ride horses. John Grady took a liking to Billy and made him one of his top hands. They worked well together and became close friends. One day, while they were rounding up cattle, they came across a herd of wild horses. John Grady told Billy to go ahead and catch one of them. Billy rode up to the lead mare and tried to catch her. She reared up and kicked him in the chest",

The revolution that was supposed to end the tyranny of a dictatorship had ripped the country apart; counties had split into factions, all threatening total destruction of the others.

All around the streets were people dressed similar to me, smiling and talking and laughing. The smog-ridden sky had been replaced with a beautiful, deep purple, but the world was light around me and the I could see the vast orange sun dipping behind the structures around the city.

Souls of the good, the bad, and everything between have always been sown by another before I pluck them from the Earth at their appropriate time. Even the ones that believe it is n't their time or ask for just one more opportunity to do what they wish, must be taken without question because, well, its just the way my job is. To me, it never mattered where they were at in life. I just carried them over with ease. Never once had experienced trouble in my task as I had even had to pluck sweet children from the arms of their mothers. However, it all changed when I was tasked with taking the soul of David Mckiny. I watched David from the day he entered the Earth, and never before had I seen someone as special as him. He always thought of others first, always trying to help others before even contemplating his own commodities. I approached him on the fateful day at exactly noon. He was old now, no longer in his prime as he was finally about to lose his battle with cancer. I approached him as the hourglass emptied completely to the bottom. I spoke to him,\" David you must know who I am at this hour.\" He answered not necessarily speaking to me,\" If only I had helped more.... If only I could have have had more time! How dreadful to go when so many more need help!\" At this moment I found it immensely hard to fulfill my task. I was not met with a man begging for more time only to waste it on fruitless trivialities. I was met with a man who wanted to bring grace to more people. He wished not to make his life better, but only cares to try to improve as many others as possible. I finally brought myself to say,\" David you have been a good man, but death is one thing which is inevitable, and not even I can grant time when someone is due. You must come along now with me.\" He allowed his soul to leave his body, a tear running down his face as he did. I extended my arm to him and he obliged. If there is one final peace to the journey is the experience of seeing one's life pass by as I guide them to the next step. I saw, as we walked, countless people who David had helped, most of which he had n't known and would never see again. Every part of me wished to guide him back to his body, but I knew I had a task to fulfill, and I knew I had to complete it.

Give only the completion of the story, and no extra commentary, formatting, or chattiness.\n\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about 500 words in length:\nI have reaped the souls of many over the course of my years as death. Souls of the good, the bad, and everything between have always been sown by another before I pluck them from the Earth at their appropriate time. Even the ones that believe it is n't their time or ask for just one more opportunity to do what they wish, must be taken without question because, well, its just the way my job is. To me, it never mattered where they were at in life. I just carried them over with ease. Never once had experienced trouble in my task as I had even had to pluck sweet children from the arms of their mothers. However, it all changed when I was tasked with taking the soul of David Mckiny. I watched David from the day he entered the Earth, and never before had I seen someone as special as him. He always thought of others first, always trying to help others before even contemplating his own commodities. I approached him on the fateful day at exactly noon. He was old now, no longer in his prime as he was finally about to lose his battle with cancer. I approached him as the hourglass emptied completely to the bottom. I spoke to him,\" David you must know who I am at this hour.\" He answered not necessarily speaking to me,\" If only I had helped more.... If only I could have have had more time! How dreadful to go when so many more need help!\" At this moment I found it immensely hard to fulfill my task. I was not met with a man begging for more time only to waste it on fruitless trivialities. I was met with a man who wanted to bring grace to more people. He wished not to make his life better, but only cares to try to improve as many others as possible. I finally brought myself to say,\" David you have been a good man, but death is one thing which is inevitable, and not even I can grant time when someone is due. You must come along now with me.\" He allowed his soul to leave his body, a tear running down his face as he did. I extended my arm to him and he obliged. If there is one final peace to the journey is the experience of seeing one's life pass by as I guide them to the next step. I saw, as we walked, countless people who David had helped, most of which he had n't known and would never see again. Every part of me wished to guide him back to his body, but I knew I had a task to fulfill, and I knew I had to complete it. After a long while of walking down the path, we finally came to the gateway where David would continue without my guidance. I never know where the person will go once they enter, but I knew David would go to a place that would have the same passion in death as he did in life. I never had such a hard time seeing someone move on, and I sat a while thinking of how tragic it is for someone like David, genuinely the best kind of person, to be taken from such a cruel world when he one of the few people who deserved to stay.

The first, a few hours before, sharply shrilled that it was time to get up and shower. Hungover and covered with the sweat and scents of the night before, I had dragged myself through the morning routine of cleansing. There was plenty of time beneath the lukewarm stream of water to contemplate the sadness of another hangover caused by drinking alone. It'd been weeks since I last had a chance to talk to another human, instead of just the PC terminal supplied by work. I towelled off and staggered through to the living-room and slumped in front of the computer, waiting for the piercing whistle to repeat, to emanate from my phone. The second alarm marked that it was time for the Remembrance. I sigh, move the empty beer bottles away from my desk and load up Hitchens 2. Since the Bliss neurovirus was released, there was a killing to be made from this sort of software; software designed to take you through a basic test, activating every faculty you'd conceivably need to prevent the atrophy. First, colour recognition and geometric shapes. Second, basic maths ramping into some gentle algebra and trigonometry. English, ethics, road safety, compassion testing, aesthetics, philosophical contemplation, the sciences. It was a hard sell at the beginning, for companies to give their employees the few hours off each morning they needed for the state-mandated testing, but given the choice between late employees and those in conscious comas, they made the right choice. Two hours later, the general test finishes. I flick through my results, 91 % recognition of the basic concepts, not too bad after a night of hard drinking. Next would come a quick half hour personal session: the names of loved ones, relations to family members, anniversaries and birthdays. A prompt flashes on the screen: \"Please enter your identity number and full name\". I rattle my digits in, 12958321-A, and tab down to the field for my name. I blank. Slight panic begins to grow as I search my beer-soaked consciousness for that basic, bloody basic, detail. It'd been too long since I last had to introduce myself with anything other than my work ID number, too long since I had any reason to say those damned words out loud. Darren? No. Christopher? No, definitely not. I shout and swear and blaspheme out loud, as I slowly feel the neurovirus go to work; Purgatory, we call it, a limbo without knowledge, tied with a purging. It dissolves me gently. The panic subsides. I stare blankly at the flashing cursor, waiting for me to enter some detail or another. I'm not sure what it's asking for, but I'm sure it's not too important or I'd remember it. I sit there, staring. Just staring.

Despite their best efforts, many of the recruits fail to meet the high standards set by Himmelstoss. Those who do manage to pass his tests are rewarded with praise and recognition, while those who fall short are subjected to harsh punishment. As the weeks go by, the recruits become increasingly frustrated and disillusioned with their situation. They begin to question the point of their training and wonder why they are being pushed to such extremes. One day, during a particularly grueling exercise, one of the recruits collapses from exhaustion. He is quickly revived by his comrades, but the incident serves as a wake-up call for the rest of the group. They realize that they must work together if they want to survive the rigors of basic training. From then on, the recruits form a tight-knit bond and support each other through the challenges ahead.

Before genes started mutating, before people received powers, before the world as he knew it ended. Things are different in the Today. We learnt it all during history in school. Mr T. brought us back to the Before and we had watched the wars, the starvation, the shootings, the massacres. Every child Today knows the story, because as some wise man in the Before had said, those who can not learn from history, are doomed to repeat it. And we don' t want that. We are lucky that the wars have ended as quickly as they begun. The Normals, like my grandfather, who were trying to kill those with powers were quickly put down by us. When my second cousin Sophia received her ability to bend the wills of others, grandfather had been most displeased. After all, it was one of the powers most feared back in the Before. Those with this ability were the ones who dominated and the wars had come. Countries fighting for dominance, millionaires waking up to find that they have signed away their fortune, men and women everywhere woke up to find that they have been doing things that they never would. It was then when the true Wars begun. Things are better Today though, people like Sophia are being kept safe. I haven' t seen her since she registered her powers two hours after she turned sixteen. Joshua, my older brother, had the ability to turn into a guinea pig. Grandfather was highly amused. It seemed though, that abilities are not hereditary. Father is a genius with technology while mother can heal with just a touch. I turn sixteen in a little less than two hours and I can' t wait to find out what my power is. It was the Law to register your abilities no more than two hours after you receive it. If you don' t, well, if you don' t, you might cease to exist. That was what we have been taught since those carefree days in preschool. They will hunt you down no matter how you try to hide. Uncle Kevin tried to hide Cousin Kingsley when they realized he could make people disappear. Well, they made Cousin Kingsley disappear. I just came into my powers.

Before genes started mutating, before people received powers, before the world as he knew it ended. Things are different in the Today. We learnt it all during history in school. Mr T. brought us back to the Before and we had watched the wars, the starvation, the shootings, the massacres. Every child Today knows the story, because as some wise man in the Before had said, those who can not learn from history, are doomed to repeat it. And we don' t want that. We are lucky that the wars have ended as quickly as they begun. The Normals, like my grandfather, who were trying to kill those with powers were quickly put down by us. When my second cousin Sophia received her ability to bend the wills of others, grandfather had been most displeased. After all, it was one of the powers most feared back in the Before. Those with this ability were the ones who dominated and the wars had come. Countries fighting for dominance, millionaires waking up to find that they have signed away their fortune, men and women everywhere woke up to find that they have been doing things that they never would. It was then when the true Wars begun. Things are better Today though, people like Sophia are being kept safe. I haven' t seen her since she registered her powers two hours after she turned sixteen. Joshua, my older brother, had the ability to turn into a guinea pig. Grandfather was highly amused. It seemed though, that abilities are not hereditary. Father is a genius with technology while mother can heal with just a touch. I turn sixteen in a little less than two hours and I can' t wait to find out what my power is. It was the Law to register your abilities no more than two hours after you receive it. If you don' t, well, if you don' t, you might cease to exist. That was what we have been taught since those carefree days in preschool. They will hunt you down no matter how you try to hide. Uncle Kevin tried to hide Cousin Kingsley when they realized he could make people disappear. Well, they made Cousin Kingsley disappear. I just came into my powers. Mother just made the most horrible sound, a hoarse, gutteral scream when I brushed by her in the cramped kitchen. She is still writhing on the ground, albeit silent.

It'd been weeks since I last had a chance to talk to another human, instead of just the PC terminal supplied by work.

He smiles back, but a little uncertain, he takes another look at my direction and says \"dude, why is your shirt bright, and I mean bright, pink\". Looking down at my grey shirt I sigh, I asked the lady at the store where I bought it, if it looked nice on me and was n't too bright. I'm sure it wo n't be the last joke someone will play on me. Indulging the stranger I quickly explain that my life is devoid of colour and to me everything looks grey.

I do n't know how to calm my mind, her dress is so bright it almost hurt's, her hair is darker then the dress but still far richer then anything that surrounds her. She looks at me and smiles, her teeth blind and her eye's are like bright spears that impale my soul. I heard the cashier make a off hand remark about her new green dress and I almost lose it. How can she be so calm and casual when talking about this colour green, her dress lights up my whole world and I felt a tear roll down my cheek. I know I ca n't wait, I ca n't live without this women, I need her colour. Getting up I make my way over, \"excuse me, miss, you are the most beautiful women in the whole world, nothing I have ever seen is close to what you are to me\" She smiles, but it does n't reach her eye's and my heart sinks. She makes some comment about her being flattered but she is already taken, grabs her coffee and goes. I'm now traveling home, and I watch the grey world pass by the window, I watch the blur of grey become one band of colour until I refocus my eye's. I walk home and enter my grey house and lay on my grey bed and all I can think of is that girl, who is she, where does she go, how can I get close to her, how can I keep her around me forever.

I saw my friends, family, strangers, all given the most precious thing in life. Lucy, my sweet dear sister, was able to fly to the heavens and back. Richard, my childhood best friend, saved hundreds of lives throughout his life, having the strength of ten men. And there I waited, for years, until my life could start, and I would transform into the real me... the powerful me. Yet, with each passing day, more people would discover their power, and I would sit waiting at night, forcing myself to sleep. My dreams were filled with possibilities, of flight and strength, and of mind and hope. But as the years passed, my dreams were less vivid. Not everyone is lucky enough to have their inner power. Some die before that beautiful gift is bestowed unto them. I thought that may happen to me. And I lived life for a while, depressed and alone. That was until I met her. Her name was Alison. She had a power, but chose not use it. She did not want to be defined by her single ability. We met during one of my travels, when I was touring the country trying to find meaning in life. I found it. I found her. From that point on, my life started. I did not care about being granted a special ability as much as I cared for her. I saw my future, a family, a wife, children. We created a beautiful life together. Alison passed away a few years ago. I had only asked her once what her power was, and she had told me it did not matter. As she was lying on her bed, slowly fading away, she told me what her inner power was. She said she was born with her power, that she had the ability to live forever, as long as she did not love. \"My power was a curse, until I found you\", she told me before she passed. Today is my 70th birthday. Today I have discovered what my power is. Old age has not been kind on me, and this is the most beautiful power I could have hoped for. When I remember my wife, the times we spent, they are not just memories any longer. I can feel the brisk of the air on the hill where we first met. I can smell the flowers. I can here her giggle, her breath against my cheek. In the little time I have left on this planet, I experience her love all over again.\n\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about 500 words in length:\nThe Seven Commandments of Animalism are established."

There, he finds a light bulb and decides to keep it hidden in his home. He begins to experiment with electricity and eventually creates a generator. His experiments lead him to discover the concept of individualism and the importance of personal freedom. He realizes that he must leave his community and find others who share his beliefs. In the end, Equality escapes from his society and joins a group of rebels who are fighting against the oppressive regime. Together, they work to create a new world where individuals can thrive and express their unique talents and abilities.\n\n",

It's now over one hundred fifty years since the birth of the first immortal. A young looking girl named Esther sat in a grassy field.

Several wars, booms in technology so astonishing that soon enough scientists said we were going to be making contact with celestial bodies outside of the solar system, and last of all the introduction of a drug you could take that would change every strand of your DNA.

Was it cruel to bring a mortal to life in the world of immortals? Immortals ruled the world and they certainly thought so. After the discovery that the drug had severe negative side effects the immortals wished to ban it as well, and so they did. It was illegal to produce it, sell it, possess it, and above all, illegal to have a child after having taken the drug. Esther had left her lab years early. She had given up on finding why they could n't fix the drug or reverse its effects. She moved out to the country, wishing she had never discovered it. The country was an expensive place to live due to the enormous population size humanity had reached, but she had more money than she would ever need.

I felt calm and serene, something I would never have expected. The awkward 0 looked at me with his dark eyes before sitting down... I felt terror... as his 0 slowly morphed into a dark and smoky 10. I left that experience behind me, but worked even harder to help others; I chose to become a prosecutor... to judge and serve justice to those who were evil. High numbers were a good indicator of evil, and it is my goal to eliminate evil. I regularly judged others based on their numbers, whether they were to be eliminated or not. Then one day, it happened. Those I judged to be evil started dying of heart attacks; sudden deaths flooded the world, and the number of criminals slowly starting reducing.

He works hard and tries to learn everything he can about the business. He also makes friends with some of the other employees. They are all very nice to him and help him out whenever they can. One day, Martin is working late in the office. It is getting dark outside and he decides to go home. As he leaves the building, he sees someone standing in the shadows. The person looks familiar but he cannot quite place them. He walks past them without saying anything. Suddenly, the person steps out of the shadows and grabs Martin by the arm. They tell him that they need to talk to him about something important. Martin is scared but he does not want to cause any trouble so he agrees to listen. The person tells him that they work for a rival company and that they have been following him for weeks. They say that they know everything",

I saw my friends, family, strangers, all given the most precious thing in life. Lucy, my sweet dear sister, was able to fly to the heavens and back.

She had a power, but chose not use it. She did not want to be defined by her single ability. We met during one of my travels, when I was touring the country trying to find meaning in life. I found it. I found her. From that point on, my life started. I did not care about being granted a special ability as much as I cared for her. I saw my future, a family, a wife, children. We created a beautiful life together. Alison passed away a few years ago. I had only asked her once what her power was, and she had told me it did not matter. As she was lying on her bed, slowly fading away, she told me what her inner power was. She said she was born with her power, that she had the ability to live forever, as long as she did not love. \"My power was a curse, until I found you\", she told me before she passed. Today is my 70th birthday. Today I have discovered what my power is. Old age has not been kind on me, and this is the most beautiful power I could have hoped for. When I remember my wife, the times we spent, they are not just memories any longer. I can feel the brisk of the air on the hill where we first met. I can smell the flowers. I can here her giggle, her breath against my cheek. In the little time I have left on this planet, I experience her love all over again.\n\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about 500 words in length:\nMartin falls in love with Leora Tozer."

Another day of studying droned on. It wasn' t that the material was a challenge, Naif had no problem absorbing every concept she came across and she had more degrees than anyone her age to prove it. Life had always been that way. In primary school she related better to adults than her classmates. In secondary school she was respectful of her teachers but felt she understood the lessons they taught to a deeper level than even they appreciated. University had been much the same except the distance between herself and her professors had turned her conscientious respect into a degree of begrudging disdain. She was certainly more intelligent than anyone she knew of, more so than anyone she had ever met. She picked apart the documents piled high on her desk recalling even the articles in the citations that she had previously read. Today her eyes were heavy, mostly with boredom, somewhat with the strain. Her mind was as sharp as it had ever been but her body showed the signs that she would not be considered a young woman for much longer. Through the closed windows she could vaguely hear the muffled hum of the world rushing by outside. Suddenly the monotony of the day fell away as it was unbound by a sharp thud against the outer wall of her office. Naif quickly straightened her hunched shoulders and bumped the table sloshing coffee over her meticulously curated stacks of research papers.

Spots of white clouds the orange-hued sky, as it slowly turns azure. Far in the distance, a silver tower, shrouded in mist, pierces the heavens above. The waves crash down on the sandy beaches, and the endless sea merges with the horizon. I take in the sights, the smells, the sounds. Feeling both pride and joy, I turn to face to you. The air is warm, but your hand is warmer. I hold it close to me, closer still. The sun is shining bright, but your smile is brighter. We' re standing at the top of our world, the one we made together, and I can' t tell you how happy this has made me. \"It' s almost time.\" You say. \"I know.\" I reply. I rest my head on your shoulder, and take a long breath as I close my eyes. I' m at peace here. When I opened them again, I was in my bed, and a bittersweet feeling of both tranquility and sadness lingered in my mind. It was around 7 a.m., and I went about my daily routine, a smile etched on my face. I wrote what had happened in a dream journal I had started two years ago. After having read about lucid dreaming, and I wanted to try it. It took some time, but one day, I was able to control the outcome of my dreams. After a few weeks, something changed. There was something else, maybe someone else, with me. I couldn' t control them, and they couldn' t control me. I searched about it in books and online, but no one reported something similar. I wasn' t afraid, though. Their presence was soothing. We rarely spoke, but when we did, it was always meaningful. Together, we started building a world, our dream island. It brought me joy, and above all, peace. This feeling of inner peace lived on with me during the day. The sun was racing across the sky as we strolled down the ruins of a castle. Holes and cracks had let nature overtake the walls and floors, and the ceiling had long since crumbled. We walked down an old throne room, and you turned to face me. It was so sudden, I nearly bumped into you. You looked resolute, and you said two simple words: \"Find me.\" I jolted awake. I knew what I had to do. I had to find you. So I searched, high and low, for days on end. Perhaps I thought it was fate, perhaps it was simply fool' s luck, but I felt as if I would eventually find you, if I kept trying. One evening, as if beckoned, I went in a coffee shop. I sat down with my coffee at an empty table, and looked up through the window at the red sky. Soon, someone came in, ordered the same thing as I did. They headed toward my table, and sat down in front of me, smiling brightly.

Forcing the enemy to rely on finite reserves is a good strategy. From our intel gathering and scouting missions we know the machines' first response will be to send two robots per every identified threat. Not a bad bit of logic on their part. The wolves were able to acquire video of some of the human assaults. We can confirm each localized machine hub will have, at minimum, 50000 robot responders. Luckily, we have some numbers. The machines decided not to bury the dead or finish off the wounded humans but to ship them away from the machine hubs. The wolf and bat armies grew after each human battle.

Forcing the enemy to rely on finite reserves is a good strategy. From our intel gathering and scouting missions we know the machines' first response will be to send two robots per every identified threat. Not a bad bit of logic on their part. The wolves were able to acquire video of some of the human assaults. We can confirm each localized machine hub will have, at minimum, 50000 robot responders. Luckily, we have some numbers. The machines decided not to bury the dead or finish off the wounded humans but to ship them away from the machine hubs. The wolf and bat armies grew after each human battle.

One day, while walking home from work, Frank sees a group of teenagers loitering outside the store. They are talking loudly and acting rowdy. Frank knows that if they enter the store, they will cause trouble and possibly steal something. He decides to intervene and try to talk some sense into them. As he approaches the group, he notices that one of the teens is carrying a baseball bat. Suddenly, the teen swings the bat at Frank, hitting him in the head. Frank falls to the ground, unconscious. When he wakes up, he finds himself in a strange room. There are four walls made of glass, and there is a bed in the center of the room. Frank realizes that he must be in a hospital.

He decides to take a loan from the bank to keep the store running. However, he soon realizes that the bank is not trustworthy and that he may lose everything. He tries to find a way to pay back the loan, but nothing seems to work. In desperation, he turns to crime and starts robbing banks. He becomes known as the \"Bank Robber\" and is hunted by the police. Despite being caught several times, he manages to escape and continue his criminal activities. Finally, after many years of struggle, he is arrested and sentenced to prison. There, he meets another prisoner named Harry, who helps him adjust to life behind bars.

Frank becomes close friends with the Bober family and feels like he has found a new home.

Along the way, they encounter many dangers and hardships, but they remain strong and determined to survive. Eventually, they reach a refugee camp where they are able to start rebuilding their lives. Despite the challenges they face, Frank remains grateful for the love and support of the Bober family and the other refugees in the camp.

Living in post-war Britain, death was not an uncommon sight. Everyone had at least one firearm to defend themselves, everyone had encountered gunfire in the streets, and everyone knew what it meant to live every day like it could be their last. The revolution that was supposed to end the tyranny of a dictatorship had ripped the country apart; counties had split into factions, all threatening total destruction of the others.

That morning, as I wandered to the local shop for some bread, clutching my rifle, my world completely ended.

My itchy, dirty clothes were replaced with beautiful white robes, soft as silk and cleaner than anything I had ever seen. I sat up, and looked around the room - it was furnished luxuriously, with beautiful gold-leaf chairs and fantastic bright works of art hanging around the room. I got up and left the room, and immediately my breath was forced from me. The crumbled grey streets of London had gone. In their place were beautiful old chalets, bright white skyscrapers, and marble streets. I could also see a very unfamiliar sight - a beautiful emerald park, littered with tall, radiant trees, ferns, and glowing coloured flowers. Clear water ran through them. All around the streets were people dressed similar to me, smiling and talking and laughing. The smog-ridden sky had been replaced with a beautiful, deep purple, but the world was light around me and the I could see the vast orange sun dipping behind the structures around the city.

Our planet, along with its some 7.8 billion population of people, have been forced to hide, or die trying. Many of us went underground, taking with us seeds and other animals to restart life if possible. We all new the odds of that though. After the first five years of preparation, we went into cryostasis, while a small population elected to stay and try and plot our course through the lonely emptiness of deep space. Needless to say, they succeeded, and they were bloody excited. Our Earth, with its surface now a comfortable -176 degrees Celsius, is on a hopeful course to the Andromeda Galaxy. We are approaching it very fast, but we believe that we will come within orbital distance and speed of at least twenty stars. And so we were awoken. Our planet, after a century of darkness, is starting to receive light from nearby stars. The boffs say that it still is only a full moon of light, but it's a change. Soon, we will pass by a red giant, and very closely. The boffs believe that it will be enough to start thawing out our cold, icy blue planet. The day has arrived. I am standing at the airlock, alongside my expeditionary unit. It's been a few days since we started our slingshot around the red giant, and the surface readings say that the temperature is stabilizing between -19 and 2 degrees. It's still cold, but it will be bearable, especially in our survival gear. We have packed 3 days of food. It's been a while since I've had a military ration pack, but the management thought it would be suitable to have one with our return to the surface. Everyone else has backed skis on their backpacks, but I've got my old snowboard kit with me. It was my passion before I left the surface. I stand here, before the airlock, googles on and pretty much looking like a... Like one of those puffy treats you roast on a stick over fire. I ca n't remember their name.

Everyone of them has lost something to the darkness, and everyone of them has determination to reclaim our planet and our lives. The air lock breaks, and a flood of air escapes and pours in.

But Dagny and Hank are determined to succeed. They hire the best engineers and workers to help them build the line. They also use the latest technology to make sure the project goes smoothly. Despite all of these efforts, however, there are still problems. There are delays, accidents, and even sabotage. But Dagny and Hank never give up. They keep working hard until the John Galt Line is finally completed. When it is finished, it is a marvel of engineering. It is the longest railroad line in the world, and it connects two coasts that were once separated by thousands of miles. The John Galt Line is a symbol of hope for America.

Looking down at my grey shirt I sigh, I asked the lady at the store where I bought it, if it looked nice on me and was n't too bright. I'm sure it wo n't be the last joke someone will play on me.

I do n't know how to calm my mind, her dress is so bright it almost hurt's, her hair is darker then the dress but still far richer then anything that surrounds her. She looks at me and smiles, her teeth blind and her eye's are like bright spears that impale my soul. I heard the cashier make a off hand remark about her new green dress and I almost lose it. How can she be so calm and casual when talking about this colour green, her dress lights up my whole world and I felt a tear roll down my cheek. I know I ca n't wait, I ca n't live without this women, I need her colour. Getting up I make my way over, \"excuse me, miss, you are the most beautiful women in the whole world, nothing I have ever seen is close to what you are to me\" She smiles, but it does n't reach her eye's and my heart sinks. She makes some comment about her being flattered but she is already taken, grabs her coffee and goes. I'm now traveling home, and I watch the grey world pass by the window, I watch the blur of grey become one band of colour until I refocus my eye's. I walk home and enter my grey house and lay on my grey bed and all I can think of is that girl, who is she, where does she go, how can I get close to her, how can I keep her around me forever.

Once there, she finds a job as a waitress in a small diner. The hours are long and the pay is low, but Taylor doesn't mind. She loves the hustle and bustle of the city and the people she meets.\n\nOne day, while taking a break from work, Taylor sees a flyer advertising a free concert in Central Park. She decides to check it out and is blown away by the music. It's unlike anything she's ever heard before. The singer has a powerful voice and the lyrics are moving. As she listens, Taylor feels a connection to the music and the artist. She knows she has to meet him.\n\nAfter the concert, Taylor approaches the singer and introduces herself. He's surprised to learn that she's from Kentucky and even more surprised to hear that she's never heard his music before. They strike up a conversation and soon find themselves falling",

All around the streets were people dressed similar to me, smiling and talking and laughing. The smog-ridden sky had been replaced with a beautiful, deep purple, but the world was light around me and the I could see the vast orange sun dipping behind the structures around the city.

I saw my friends, family, strangers, all given the most precious thing in life. Lucy, my sweet dear sister, was able to fly to the heavens and back. Richard, my childhood best friend, saved hundreds of lives throughout his life, having the strength of ten men. And there I waited, for years, until my life could start, and I would transform into the real me... the powerful me. Yet, with each passing day, more people would discover their power, and I would sit waiting at night, forcing myself to sleep. My dreams were filled with possibilities, of flight and strength, and of mind and hope. But as the years passed, my dreams were less vivid. Not everyone is lucky enough to have their inner power. Some die before that beautiful gift is bestowed unto them. I thought that may happen to me. And I lived life for a while, depressed and alone. That was until I met her. Her name was Alison. She had a power, but chose not use it. She did not want to be defined by her single ability. We met during one of my travels, when I was touring the country trying to find meaning in life. I found it. I found her. From that point on, my life started. I did not care about being granted a special ability as much as I cared for her. I saw my future, a family, a wife, children. We created a beautiful life together. Alison passed away a few years ago. I had only asked her once what her power was, and she had told me it did not matter. As she was lying on her bed, slowly fading away, she told me what her inner power was. She said she was born with her power, that she had the ability to live forever, as long as she did not love. \"My power was a curse, until I found you\", she told me before she passed. Today is my 70th birthday. Today I have discovered what my power is. Old age has not been kind on me, and this is the most beautiful power I could have hoped for. When I remember my wife, the times we spent, they are not just memories any longer. I can feel the brisk of the air on the hill where we first met. I can smell the flowers. I can here her giggle, her breath against my cheek.

Taylor tries to run, but the men are too fast. They catch up to him and beat him unconscious. When Taylor wakes up, he finds himself tied up to a tree.

The dawn of a new day, when humans thought to sneak up on the Deep Woods Dragon while it slept. It feared the way the sun reflected off of it' s scales, they said. It' s prismatic hide was so bright it was blinding. If taunted into the sun, they said, the Deep Woods Dragon could be defeated by the least trained of knights. The Deep Woods Dragon needed to be blinded, they said, or it would burn its attackers to ashes with rainbow-hued flames. He knew these rumors because the butterflies had told him. They were drawn to the rainbow of greens, yellows, pinks and purples of his scales, like the flowers they coveted so much. They had told him this, too, but the Dragon did not mind. The butterflies were honest, as their lives were short and beautiful. Even still, they could fly unhindered among the humans, even admired by the small humans who chased them, laughing. They told him stories while they rested on his wingtips, tail, and snout. Butterflies did not fear the Dragon, because they knew the truth. With a yawn, the Dragon shifted its weight to better perch itself on the tree' s stout branch. This tree was taller than the others, and overlooked a small, circular clearing. Without the deer, the weeds thrived, covering the dirt in a green, tangled mass. At the edge of the clearing stood a massive cave entrance, vines draped over the sides of smooth rock. The Dragon had snapped off the vines in front of the entrance, to give the illusion of occupancy. This was, after all, where the humans thought he lived. He knew these rumors because the butterflies had told him. \"In an ancient cave in the middle of the wood, lives an ancient dragon who' s up to no good!\" That was what the small humans like to chant as they chased the butterflies and laughed. So the Dragon tore at the vines, and scared the graceful deer from the peaceful clearing. He had enjoyed watching the deer with their young as they grazed the clearing. From up above in his favorite tree, they could not see him, and they could not fear him. Three times a day, the Dragon glided down from his tree to the old cave' s opening. There, he took a deep breath and screamed as loud as he could. He cried in both low tones and high pitches. He wailed in imitation of female humans, shouted in a voice mimicking angry male humans. The Dragon stood on top of the cave and breathed eye-searing beams of light from his mouth to the sky. It scared the birds huddled in the trees, and the noises scared the deer far from the clearing. But they also scared the humans away from the Deep Woods. He knew these rumors because the butterflies had told him. So he made his noises, made the lights, and scared the humans away. Because any humans who saw the Dragon would discover the truth. Because, when the Dragon stepped into the sunlight, they' d see how small he really was. The Deep Woods Dragon, with prismatic scales that shone in the sun and such a frightening voice, was the size of a domestic house cat. And only the butterflies knew the truth.\n\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about 500 words in length:\nEsther Greenwood wins an internship at Ladies Day magazine in New York."

The Dragon stood on top of the cave and breathed eye-searing beams of light from his mouth to the sky. It scared the birds huddled in the trees, and the noises scared the deer far from the clearing. But they also scared the humans away from the Deep Woods. He knew these rumors because the butterflies had told him. So he made his noises, made the lights, and scared the humans away. Because any humans who saw the Dragon would discover the truth. Because, when the Dragon stepped into the sunlight, they' d see how small he really was. The Deep Woods Dragon, with prismatic scales that shone in the sun and such a frightening voice, was the size of a domestic house cat. And only the butterflies knew the truth.\n\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about 500 words in length:\nEsther Greenwood wins an internship at Ladies Day magazine in New York.",

Spots of white clouds the orange-hued sky, as it slowly turns azure. Far in the distance, a silver tower, shrouded in mist, pierces the heavens above. The waves crash down on the sandy beaches, and the endless sea merges with the horizon. I take in the sights, the smells, the sounds. Feeling both pride and joy, I turn to face to you. The air is warm, but your hand is warmer. I hold it close to me, closer still. The sun is shining bright, but your smile is brighter. We' re standing at the top of our world, the one we made together, and I can' t tell you how happy this has made me. \"It' s almost time.\" You say. \"I know.\" I reply.

I wasn' t afraid, though. Their presence was soothing. We rarely spoke, but when we did, it was always meaningful. Together, we started building a world, our dream island. It brought me joy, and above all, peace. This feeling of inner peace lived on with me during the day. The sun was racing across the sky as we strolled down the ruins of a castle.

She takes a walk around the city, enjoying the fresh air and the sights. As she walks, she notices a man following her. He seems to be trying to hide his face, but Esther can still see him clearly. She quickens her pace, but he keeps up with her. Finally, she turns around and confronts him. \"What are you doing?\" she asks. \"I'm sorry,\" he says. \"I didn't mean to scare you.\" \"Then why are you following me?\" Esther demands. \"I just want to talk to you,\" he replies. \"About what?\" \"About your work,\" he says. \"I think you're amazing.\" Esther is taken aback.

The soft rays bathe the distant hills in gold, as the breeze blows through the dancing grass. The trees shivers as flock of birds take flight. Spots of white clouds the orange-hued sky, as it slowly turns azure. Far in the distance, a silver tower, shrouded in mist, pierces the heavens above. The waves crash down on the sandy beaches, and the endless sea merges with the horizon. I take in the sights, the smells, the sounds. Feeling both pride and joy, I turn to face to you. The air is warm, but your hand is warmer. I hold it close to me, closer still. The sun is shining bright, but your smile is brighter. We' re standing at the top of our world, the one we made together, and I can' t tell you how happy this has made me. \"It' s almost time.\" You say. \"I know.\" I reply. I rest my head on your shoulder, and take a long breath as I close my eyes. I' m at peace here. When I opened them again, I was in my bed, and a bittersweet feeling of both tranquility and sadness lingered in my mind.

After having read about lucid dreaming, and I wanted to try it. It took some time, but one day, I was able to control the outcome of my dreams. After a few weeks, something changed. There was something else, maybe someone else, with me. I couldn' t control them, and they couldn' t control me. I searched about it in books and online, but no one reported something similar. I wasn' t afraid, though. Their presence was soothing. We rarely spoke, but when we did, it was always meaningful. Together, we started building a world, our dream island. It brought me joy, and above all, peace. This feeling of inner peace lived on with me during the day. The sun was racing across the sky as we strolled down the ruins of a castle. Holes and cracks had let nature overtake the walls and floors, and the ceiling had long since crumbled. We walked down an old throne room, and you turned to face me. It was so sudden, I nearly bumped into you. You looked resolute, and you said two simple words: \"Find me.\" I jolted awake. I knew what I had to do. I had to find you. So I searched, high and low, for days on end. Perhaps I thought it was fate, perhaps it was simply fool' s luck, but I felt as if I would eventually find you, if I kept trying. One evening, as if beckoned, I went in a coffee shop. I sat down with my coffee at an empty table, and looked up through the window at the red sky. Soon, someone came in, ordered the same thing as I did. They headed toward my table, and sat down in front of me, smiling brightly.

However, she soon realizes that she's not the only one who's been affected by the food poisoning. Many of the other contestants are also sick, and some of them may even die.

He wants freedom more than anything else in the world. So one night, he leads his fellow slaves into the woods. They run as fast as they can, but they know that the guards will catch them soon.

Another day of studying droned on. It wasn' t that the material was a challenge, Naif had no problem absorbing every concept she came across and she had more degrees than anyone her age to prove it. Life had always been that way. In primary school she related better to adults than her classmates. In secondary school she was respectful of her teachers but felt she understood the lessons they taught to a deeper level than even they appreciated. University had been much the same except the distance between herself and her professors had turned her conscientious respect into a degree of begrudging disdain. She was certainly more intelligent than anyone she knew of, more so than anyone she had ever met. She picked apart the documents piled high on her desk recalling even the articles in the citations that she had previously read. Today her eyes were heavy, mostly with boredom, somewhat with the strain. Her mind was as sharp as it had ever been but her body showed the signs that she would not be considered a young woman for much longer. Through the closed windows she could vaguely hear the muffled hum of the world rushing by outside. Suddenly the monotony of the day fell away as it was unbound by a sharp thud against the outer wall of her office. Naif quickly straightened her hunched shoulders and bumped the table sloshing coffee over her meticulously curated stacks of research papers. She snarled impatiently at the mess and sprang to the window. She squinted through the blinds at the sunlit scene then furrowed them even further in annoyance. The neighbours were playing baseball with their kids again. Idiots. Hadn' t they any respect for others? One of the little morons ran up to the edge of Naif's apartment, beneath her field of view, and tried to throw the ball back. It careened off course and the cretin had to go pick it up again to return it to his waiting family. Naif rolled her eyes as she turned away from the display of incompetence and inefficiency that played out beyond her walls. As she sopped up the spilled coffee from her desk she mumbled to herself, as she had before, \"I wish everyone were more intelligent. I would have so much more to share with them, so much more in common. They run around all day never thinking of their actions, of their futures. Such wasted potential in all that frivolity.\" Though as she settled back into her comfortably worn chair she couldn' t help feeling that there was something more to it that she just didn' t quite understand.\n\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about 500 words in length:\nBilly is admonished for petty errors, surprising him."

Naif quickly straightened her hunched shoulders and bumped the table sloshing coffee over her meticulously curated stacks of research papers. She snarled impatiently at the mess and sprang to the window. She squinted through the blinds at the sunlit scene then furrowed them even further in annoyance. The neighbours were playing baseball with their kids again. Idiots. Hadn' t they any respect for others? One of the little morons ran up to the edge of Naif's apartment, beneath her field of view, and tried to throw the ball back. It careened off course and the cretin had to go pick it up again to return it to his waiting family. Naif rolled her eyes as she turned away from the display of incompetence and inefficiency that played out beyond her walls. As she sopped up the spilled coffee from her desk she mumbled to herself, as she had before, \"I wish everyone were more intelligent. I would have so much more to share with them, so much more in common. They run around all day never thinking of their actions, of their futures. Such wasted potential in all that frivolity.\" Though as she settled back into her comfortably worn chair she couldn' t help feeling that there was something more to it that she just didn' t quite understand.\n\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about 500 words in length:\nBilly is admonished for petty errors, surprising him.",

He wonders why he isn't given more responsibility. He decides to take matters into his own hands. He starts making changes without telling anyone. He makes sure everything is done right.

The dawn of a new day, when humans thought to sneak up on the Deep Woods Dragon while it slept. It feared the way the sun reflected off of it' s scales, they said. It' s prismatic hide was so bright it was blinding. If taunted into the sun, they said, the Deep Woods Dragon could be defeated by the least trained of knights. The Deep Woods Dragon needed to be blinded, they said, or it would burn its attackers to ashes with rainbow-hued flames. He knew these rumors because the butterflies had told him. They were drawn to the rainbow of greens, yellows, pinks and purples of his scales, like the flowers they coveted so much. They had told him this, too, but the Dragon did not mind. The butterflies were honest, as their lives were short and beautiful. Even still, they could fly unhindered among the humans, even admired by the small humans who chased them, laughing. They told him stories while they rested on his wingtips, tail, and snout. Butterflies did not fear the Dragon, because they knew the truth. With a yawn, the Dragon shifted its weight to better perch itself on the tree' s stout branch. This tree was taller than the others, and overlooked a small, circular clearing. Without the deer, the weeds thrived, covering the dirt in a green, tangled mass. At the edge of the clearing stood a massive cave entrance, vines draped over the sides of smooth rock. The Dragon had snapped off the vines in front of the entrance, to give the illusion of occupancy. This was, after all, where the humans thought he lived. He knew these rumors because the butterflies had told him. \"In an ancient cave in the middle of the wood, lives an ancient dragon who' s up to no good!\" That was what the small humans like to chant as they chased the butterflies and laughed. So the Dragon tore at the vines, and scared the graceful deer from the peaceful clearing. He had enjoyed watching the deer with their young as they grazed the clearing. From up above in his favorite tree, they could not see him, and they could not fear him. Three times a day, the Dragon glided down from his tree to the old cave' s opening. There, he took a deep breath and screamed as loud as he could. He cried in both low tones and high pitches. He wailed in imitation of female humans, shouted in a voice mimicking angry male humans. The Dragon stood on top of the cave and breathed eye-searing beams of light from his mouth to the sky. It scared the birds huddled in the trees, and the noises scared the deer far from the clearing.

The dawn of a new day, when humans thought to sneak up on the Deep Woods Dragon while it slept. It feared the way the sun reflected off of it' s scales, they said. It' s prismatic hide was so bright it was blinding. If taunted into the sun, they said, the Deep Woods Dragon could be defeated by the least trained of knights. The Deep Woods Dragon needed to be blinded, they said, or it would burn its attackers to ashes with rainbow-hued flames. He knew these rumors because the butterflies had told him. They were drawn to the rainbow of greens, yellows, pinks and purples of his scales, like the flowers they coveted so much. They had told him this, too, but the Dragon did not mind. The butterflies were honest, as their lives were short and beautiful. Even still, they could fly unhindered among the humans, even admired by the small humans who chased them, laughing. They told him stories while they rested on his wingtips, tail, and snout. Butterflies did not fear the Dragon, because they knew the truth. With a yawn, the Dragon shifted its weight to better perch itself on the tree' s stout branch. This tree was taller than the others, and overlooked a small, circular clearing. Without the deer, the weeds thrived, covering the dirt in a green, tangled mass. At the edge of the clearing stood a massive cave entrance, vines draped over the sides of smooth rock. The Dragon had snapped off the vines in front of the entrance, to give the illusion of occupancy. This was, after all, where the humans thought he lived. He knew these rumors because the butterflies had told him. \"In an ancient cave in the middle of the wood, lives an ancient dragon who' s up to no good!\" That was what the small humans like to chant as they chased the butterflies and laughed. So the Dragon tore at the vines, and scared the graceful deer from the peaceful clearing. He had enjoyed watching the deer with their young as they grazed the clearing. From up above in his favorite tree, they could not see him, and they could not fear him. Three times a day, the Dragon glided down from his tree to the old cave' s opening. There, he took a deep breath and screamed as loud as he could. He cried in both low tones and high pitches. He wailed in imitation of female humans, shouted in a voice mimicking angry male humans. The Dragon stood on top of the cave and breathed eye-searing beams of light from his mouth to the sky. It scared the birds huddled in the trees, and the noises scared the deer far from the clearing. But they also scared the humans away from the Deep Woods. He knew these rumors because the butterflies had told him. So he made his noises, made the lights, and scared the humans away. Because any humans who saw the Dragon would discover the truth. Because, when the Dragon stepped into the sunlight, they' d see how small he really was.

I saw my friends, family, strangers, all given the most precious thing in life. Lucy, my sweet dear sister, was able to fly to the heavens and back. Richard, my childhood best friend, saved hundreds of lives throughout his life, having the strength of ten men. And there I waited, for years, until my life could start, and I would transform into the real me... the powerful me. Yet, with each passing day, more people would discover their power, and I would sit waiting at night, forcing myself to sleep. My dreams were filled with possibilities, of flight and strength, and of mind and hope. But as the years passed, my dreams were less vivid. Not everyone is lucky enough to have their inner power. Some die before that beautiful gift is bestowed unto them. I thought that may happen to me. And I lived life for a while, depressed and alone. That was until I met her. Her name was Alison. She had a power, but chose not use it. She did not want to be defined by her single ability. We met during one of my travels, when I was touring the country trying to find meaning in life. I found it. I found her. From that point on, my life started. I did not care about being granted a special ability as much as I cared for her. I saw my future, a family, a wife, children. We created a beautiful life together. Alison passed away a few years ago. I had only asked her once what her power was, and she had told me it did not matter. As she was lying on her bed, slowly fading away, she told me what her inner power was. She said she was born with her power, that she had the ability to live forever, as long as she did not love. \"My power was a curse, until I found you\", she told me before she passed. Today is my 70th birthday. Today I have discovered what my power is. Old age has not been kind on me, and this is the most beautiful power I could have hoped for. When I remember my wife, the times we spent, they are not just memories any longer. I can feel the brisk of the air on the hill where we first met. I can smell the flowers. I can here her giggle, her breath against my cheek. In the little time I have left on this planet, I experience her love all over again.\n\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about 500 words in length:\nBlack Elk is granted a powerful vision at age nine."
