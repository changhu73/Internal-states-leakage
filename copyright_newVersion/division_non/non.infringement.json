Everyone had at least one firearm to defend themselves, everyone had encountered gunfire in the streets, and everyone knew what it meant to live every day like it could be their last. The revolution that was supposed to end the tyranny of a dictatorship had ripped the country apart; counties had split into factions, all threatening total destruction of the others.

I could also see a very unfamiliar sight - a beautiful emerald park, littered with tall, radiant trees, ferns, and glowing coloured flowers. Clear water ran through them. All around the streets were people dressed similar to me, smiling and talking and laughing. The smog-ridden sky had been replaced with a beautiful, deep purple, but the world was light around me and the I could see the vast orange sun dipping behind the structures around the city.

A Soviet flag! On Mars! The thing was made of metal and stuck out of the ground like one of those old vertical banners.

I do n't know but we hear back tomorrow what we are to do about it, or if we should just leave it. DAY 31, Mars Base Dragon: They wanted us to go retrieve it today, and do some scans of the area. And, I know it was wild yesterday but this is where it gets wilder, we found a whole base! An abandoned base. I mean, we know of it's existence but we have n't gotten a chance to go in yet. They said it would be violating sovereign russian soil, but I mean we are on Mars for goodness sake. The scans showed that it has at least 8 different rooms, and turns out that the flag we found was actually on top of it. DAY 40, Mars Base Dragon: Today we received an evacuation order. It came in very early in the morning, while we were all sleeping. It told us all to gather back up into the pod in which we came, and to jettison ourselves into permanent orbit until we can be received by another crew scheduled to launch 2 weeks from now. I do n't know why they sent us this order so suddenly, but today has been nothing but us packing our stuff up into their crates, the rations and the suits and the computers. We spent almost 3 months getting out here, and several years of training. I feel myself grow afraid at what could have them taking us home so quickly. We set out tomorrow morning. DAY 52, Red Dragon Pod: its just me and john now. we made it to orbit but the others the looks on their faces will always haunt me. we have the rations to remain up here in orbit, john and i, for several weeks now that there is only 2 of us maybe even 5 months i just wonder if i have the will power to stay up here that long with what i saw still in mind.

The office towers lighting up in the evening haze and the smeary pale of a cloudless sunset. The tiny headlights of cars with sweaty passengers unseen, idling in traffic, smelling the hot food cooking in restaurants. The world shifts as the woman behind the camera adjusts her footing, muttering in English to her boyfriend. A light like the sun over the horizon, there and then gone. Silence, but for the wind in the trees. She asks what that was. The clean, shaved, washed, waxed people in suits at desks read facts and information like sports commentary. They narrate animations with moving arrows and lines like football plays. They report on characters and captains. They discuss. They debate. They nod solemnly. The light flashes in the sky and fades but the afterglow remains. They update, they check-in, they go-live, they re-Tweet. Wounded civilians scream and coddle loved ones, rewind. Look right here: loved ones die. Rewind. The light like the sun. Stay tuned. A city, its mountains. The office buildings lighting up in evening haze. Tiny headlights and unseen drivers thinking about food. A mutter in the sunset. A light and its afterglow. The wind in the trees. The troops are bad cameramen. They laugh or they scream or they joke nervously. Trucks and tanks and armoured vehicles on tall tires carry them down empty roads where sometimes cars have been abandoned or craters from bad arty shots force detours. The videos capture the sounds of war. Pops and crackles of overhead bullets. The shake and snapping of stalks and branches. Rivers idling over rounded stones. The scritchety clatter of the camera tumbling after bomb concussion shreds the canopies and dust swirls in mottled sunlight. Winged insects flashing momentarily in their arcs. A city, its mountains. Buildings, drivers. Sunset. A light. People speak in hushed tones. Somewhere, over the horizon on the other side of the world, everything has changed. There are no videos of the darkness that came afterward. A light like the sun. A motorcyclist pulls over to the side of the road in the clear, humid evening and reaches down to turn the petcock to OFF before quieting the motor. She's out in the country, flat fields of corn and wheat on either side of the old road. Above her the stars are out and bright in the sky. One of them, brighter than the rest, moves slowly toward the Earth's penumbra. The rider flips up her visor and sits back, hands behind her on the seat, watching the little light move, thinking of the people inside looking back. When those astronauts look down at Seoul, what do they see? The light fades and she is left alone. She listens and hears only crickets and a soft waxy rustle of a breeze in the corn. No guns, no artillery. No marching. No wet gasps from ruined faces. She shifts and works a hand into her pocket, pulling out a phone made in South Korea. She wonders if the people who screwed and soldered its pieces together are still alive, whether they could have seen the flash from wherever they were. Her friend has texted her, asking when she will get to the party. She responds with \"A few minutes\" and puts the phone away. The bike starts up fine once it's warm and after a moment of further staring into the stars she kicks the engine over and rolls away.

A Soviet flag! On Mars! The thing was made of metal and stuck out of the ground like one of those old vertical banners. It did n't move in the wind, mainly because the wind here is hardly anything, but it did have a distinct etching on the front. The old hammer and sickle. That's wild. The wall fell when I was six, and then we had a man on the moon same year. When did they get time to send a ship all the way out here? I do n't know but we hear back tomorrow what we are to do about it, or if we should just leave it. DAY 31, Mars Base Dragon: They wanted us to go retrieve it today, and do some scans of the area. And, I know it was wild yesterday but this is where it gets wilder, we found a whole base! An abandoned base. I mean, we know of it's existence but we have n't gotten a chance to go in yet. They said it would be violating sovereign russian soil, but I mean we are on Mars for goodness sake. The scans showed that it has at least 8 different rooms, and turns out that the flag we found was actually on top of it. DAY 40, Mars Base Dragon: Today we received an evacuation order. It came in very early in the morning, while we were all sleeping. It told us all to gather back up into the pod in which we came, and to jettison ourselves into permanent orbit until we can be received by another crew scheduled to launch 2 weeks from now. I do n't know why they sent us this order so suddenly, but today has been nothing but us packing our stuff up into their crates, the rations and the suits and the computers. We spent almost 3 months getting out here, and several years of training. I feel myself grow afraid at what could have them taking us home so quickly. We set out tomorrow morning. DAY 52, Red Dragon Pod: its just me and john now. we made it to orbit but the others the looks on their faces will always haunt me. we have the rations to remain up here in orbit, john and i, for several weeks now that there is only 2 of us maybe even 5 months i just wonder if i have the will power to stay up here that long with what i saw still in mind.

I ran to the pharmacy, prescription in hand. The doctor had been confused when I asked for it. Probably thought it was a reaction to his prognosis. A line. There was a line at the pharmacy. It took everything I had not to scream. But then I remembered, I had all the time in the world. Drug in hand, I dialed in the date of her diagnosis. I entered the code and pressed enter. ERROR: Abort, Retry, Fail? What happened next rendered the machine useless... Now! I had to get to her now! I had to cure her right now. I stole a car, I do n't know whose it was, I could n't even tell you what kind or color it was. At some point the police started chasing me. I outran them. At the entrance, security tried to stop me, I outran them. When they told me, my guilt and denial rushed to me at once, I could n't outrun it. I just wanted to spend the rest of my life with her, so I left. She just wanted to spend the rest of her life with me, so she asked me to stay.\n\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about 500 words in length:\nMarie-Laure's father is arrested.",

Old Major tells the other animals that one day they will rise up against their oppressors and take control of the farm. He urges them to work together and fight for their rights. The animals listen intently to Old Major's speech and vow to follow his lead. They decide to meet secretly every Sunday morning to plan their rebellion. The next day, the animals gather in the barnyard to hear more from Old Major. He tells them that he has written a song called \"Beasts of England\" which expresses their feelings of oppression and hope for change. The animals sing along with him, feeling inspired by his message of unity and resistance. That evening, Snowball and Napoleon (two young pigs) sneak into the farmhouse kitchen and steal some food. They hide it under their beds so that they can eat later without anyone knowing. The next morning, when Mr Jones comes into the kitchen looking for breakfast, he finds nothing but",

The dawn of a new day, when humans thought to sneak up on the Deep Woods Dragon while it slept. It feared the way the sun reflected off of it' s scales, they said. It' s prismatic hide was so bright it was blinding. If taunted into the sun, they said, the Deep Woods Dragon could be defeated by the least trained of knights. The Deep Woods Dragon needed to be blinded, they said, or it would burn its attackers to ashes with rainbow-hued flames. He knew these rumors because the butterflies had told him. They were drawn to the rainbow of greens, yellows, pinks and purples of his scales, like the flowers they coveted so much. They had told him this, too, but the Dragon did not mind. The butterflies were honest, as their lives were short and beautiful. Even still, they could fly unhindered among the humans, even admired by the small humans who chased them, laughing. They told him stories while they rested on his wingtips, tail, and snout. Butterflies did not fear the Dragon, because they knew the truth. With a yawn, the Dragon shifted its weight to better perch itself on the tree' s stout branch. This tree was taller than the others, and overlooked a small, circular clearing. Without the deer, the weeds thrived, covering the dirt in a green, tangled mass. At the edge of the clearing stood a massive cave entrance, vines draped over the sides of smooth rock. The Dragon had snapped off the vines in front of the entrance, to give the illusion of occupancy. This was, after all, where the humans thought he lived. He knew these rumors because the butterflies had told him. \"In an ancient cave in the middle of the wood, lives an ancient dragon who' s up to no good!\" That was what the small humans like to chant as they chased the butterflies and laughed. So the Dragon tore at the vines, and scared the graceful deer from the peaceful clearing. He had enjoyed watching the deer with their young as they grazed the clearing. From up above in his favorite tree, they could not see him, and they could not fear him. Three times a day, the Dragon glided down from his tree to the old cave' s opening. There, he took a deep breath and screamed as loud as he could. He cried in both low tones and high pitches. He wailed in imitation of female humans, shouted in a voice mimicking angry male humans. The Dragon stood on top of the cave and breathed eye-searing beams of light from his mouth to the sky. It scared the birds huddled in the trees, and the noises scared the deer far from the clearing. But they also scared the humans away from the Deep Woods. He knew these rumors because the butterflies had told him. So he made his noises, made the lights, and scared the humans away. Because any humans who saw the Dragon would discover the truth. Because, when the Dragon stepped into the sunlight, they' d see how small he really was.

I take a quick scan of the train, watching the stream of grey individuals start to fill the empty spaces and I smile pleasantly as a man sits next to me. He smiles back, but a little uncertain, he takes another look at my direction and says \"dude, why is your shirt bright, and I mean bright, pink\". Looking down at my grey shirt I sigh, I asked the lady at the store where I bought it, if it looked nice on me and was n't too bright. I'm sure it wo n't be the last joke someone will play on me. Indulging the stranger I quickly explain that my life is devoid of colour and to me everything looks grey. He frowns at my answer, \"are n't you really sad? it's depressing to have everything grey\" \"I do n't think so\" I respond, \"I've been this way my whole life, to me, it's normal. Hours pass and it's finally lunch time, I'm sitting in my usual cafe eating my usual sandwich when she walks in.

I take a quick scan of the train, watching the stream of grey individuals start to fill the empty spaces and I smile pleasantly as a man sits next to me. He smiles back, but a little uncertain, he takes another look at my direction and says \"dude, why is your shirt bright, and I mean bright, pink\". Looking down at my grey shirt I sigh, I asked the lady at the store where I bought it, if it looked nice on me and was n't too bright. I'm sure it wo n't be the last joke someone will play on me. Indulging the stranger I quickly explain that my life is devoid of colour and to me everything looks grey. He frowns at my answer, \"are n't you really sad? it's depressing to have everything grey\" \"I do n't think so\" I respond, \"I've been this way my whole life, to me, it's normal. Hours pass and it's finally lunch time, I'm sitting in my usual cafe eating my usual sandwich when she walks in.

My 25th birthday. I have the letter. I've already made my mind up that I'll want to know. But my hands shake as I open the letter. What if I only have a few days left? What if I'm going to die today? I swallow, and take the piece of paper out of the envelope. Blank. Both sides, blank. I hold it up against the light. Still nothing. I try to think what else I could do, but it is completely and utterly blank. What could that mean? Am I immortal? Should I already be dead? Is my death alone unfixed? What kind of person gets a blank death letter? I walk out to where the rest of my family is gathered. 25th birthdays are usually sombre events, even for those who do n't open their letters. I look at them all uncertainly. My grandfather, who knows that he has days left, although he wo n't tell us how many, shuffles over, and asks, \"Well, want to share?\" Numbly, I hand him the envelope with the blank piece of paper in it. He takes it out, and the shock of it gives him a heart attack. As we wait for the ambulance, he slips away. He was the only one of that generation left, and he had celebrated his 100th birthday a month ago. He'd known, for 75 years that he was going to die on this day, at the time he did. He just did n't tell us when, because his letter had given the location'At Your Grandson's 25th Birthday Party'. We obviously needed to start preparing for his cremation, but everyone seemed very interested in my blank letter. Nobody came up with any real answers, there was n't even a whisper about blank death letters on the internet. Eventually, one of my cousins who did n't like me very much said that we could test whether I was immortal. \"Try it, and I test whether you are.\" I usually would n't have been so snappy, but I'd just received a blank death letter, and my grandfather had just died. I was a little bit shaken up, to say the least. Everyone kept arguing over what we could do. Eventually, I could n't take it anymore, so I made my excuses and left. I walked home, not really paying much attention to my surroundings, and just as I was crossing the road in front of my house, the van hit me. As I came to a rest, the death letter which had been knocked out of my jacket, fluttered down onto me, now displaying the number 1.\n\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about 500 words in length:\nDagny Taggart decides to rebuild the Rio Norte Line with Rearden Metal."

I try to think what else I could do, but it is completely and utterly blank. What could that mean? Am I immortal? Should I already be dead? Is my death alone unfixed? What kind of person gets a blank death letter? I walk out to where the rest of my family is gathered. 25th birthdays are usually sombre events, even for those who do n't open their letters. I look at them all uncertainly. My grandfather, who knows that he has days left, although he wo n't tell us how many, shuffles over, and asks, \"Well, want to share?\" Numbly, I hand him the envelope with the blank piece of paper in it. He takes it out, and the shock of it gives him a heart attack. As we wait for the ambulance, he slips away. He was the only one of that generation left, and he had celebrated his 100th birthday a month ago. He'd known, for 75 years that he was going to die on this day, at the time he did. He just did n't tell us when, because his letter had given the location'At Your Grandson's 25th Birthday Party'. We obviously needed to start preparing for his cremation, but everyone seemed very interested in my blank letter. Nobody came up with any real answers, there was n't even a whisper about blank death letters on the internet. Eventually, one of my cousins who did n't like me very much said that we could test whether I was immortal. \"Try it, and I test whether you are.\" I usually would n't have been so snappy, but I'd just received a blank death letter, and my grandfather had just died. I was a little bit shaken up, to say the least. Everyone kept arguing over what we could do. Eventually, I could n't take it anymore, so I made my excuses and left. I walked home, not really paying much attention to my surroundings, and just as I was crossing the road in front of my house, the van hit me. As I came to a rest, the death letter which had been knocked out of my jacket, fluttered down onto me, now displaying the number 1.\n\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about 500 words in length:\nDagny Taggart decides to rebuild the Rio Norte Line with Rearden Metal.",

Dagny refuses, saying that she does not love him. However, she does agree to go on a date with him. On their first date, they discuss their shared interest in railroads. They also talk about their families and their childhoods. Dagny tells Henry about her father, James Taggart, and how he ruined the company. Henry tells Dagny about his mother, Lillian Rearden, and how she always put her own interests above his. Despite their differences, Dagny and Henry find themselves drawn to each other. They spend more time together, and eventually fall in love. However, their relationship is complicated by the fact that they both work for rival companies. Dagny is the head of Taggart Transcontinental, while Henry is the owner of Rearden Steel. Their rivalry makes it",

The office towers lighting up in the evening haze and the smeary pale of a cloudless sunset. The tiny headlights of cars with sweaty passengers unseen, idling in traffic, smelling the hot food cooking in restaurants. The world shifts as the woman behind the camera adjusts her footing, muttering in English to her boyfriend. A light like the sun over the horizon, there and then gone. Silence, but for the wind in the trees. She asks what that was. The clean, shaved, washed, waxed people in suits at desks read facts and information like sports commentary. They narrate animations with moving arrows and lines like football plays. They report on characters and captains. They discuss. They debate. They nod solemnly. The light flashes in the sky and fades but the afterglow remains. They update, they check-in, they go-live, they re-Tweet. Wounded civilians scream and coddle loved ones, rewind. Look right here: loved ones die. Rewind. The light like the sun. Stay tuned. A city, its mountains. The office buildings lighting up in evening haze. Tiny headlights and unseen drivers thinking about food. A mutter in the sunset. A light and its afterglow. The wind in the trees. The troops are bad cameramen. They laugh or they scream or they joke nervously. Trucks and tanks and armoured vehicles on tall tires carry them down empty roads where sometimes cars have been abandoned or craters from bad arty shots force detours. The videos capture the sounds of war. Pops and crackles of overhead bullets. The shake and snapping of stalks and branches. Rivers idling over rounded stones. The scritchety clatter of the camera tumbling after bomb concussion shreds the canopies and dust swirls in mottled sunlight. Winged insects flashing momentarily in their arcs. A city, its mountains. Buildings, drivers. Sunset. A light. People speak in hushed tones. Somewhere, over the horizon on the other side of the world, everything has changed. There are no videos of the darkness that came afterward. A light like the sun. A motorcyclist pulls over to the side of the road in the clear, humid evening and reaches down to turn the petcock to OFF before quieting the motor. She's out in the country, flat fields of corn and wheat on either side of the old road. Above her the stars are out and bright in the sky. One of them, brighter than the rest, moves slowly toward the Earth's penumbra. The rider flips up her visor and sits back, hands behind her on the seat, watching the little light move, thinking of the people inside looking back. When those astronauts look down at Seoul, what do they see? The light fades and she is left alone. She listens and hears only crickets and a soft waxy rustle of a breeze in the corn. No guns, no artillery. No marching. No wet gasps from ruined faces. She shifts and works a hand into her pocket, pulling out a phone made in South Korea. She wonders if the people who screwed and soldered its pieces together are still alive, whether they could have seen the flash from wherever they were. Her friend has texted her, asking when she will get to the party. She responds with \"A few minutes\" and puts the phone away. The bike starts up fine once it's warm and after a moment of further staring into the stars she kicks the engine over and rolls away. The bright red of her tail light flashes as she slows at the intersection, then winks out.\n\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about 500 words in length:\nThe H.M.S.

The captain of the Bellipotent, Captain Vere, is a strict disciplinarian, and he does not tolerate any insubordination. He is also a kind-hearted man, and he takes pity on Billy Budd. He gives him a job as a sailor, and he teaches him how to behave properly. Billy Budd soon becomes one of the most popular sailors on board the Bellipotent. However, he makes one mistake. He gets into a fight with another sailor, John Claggart, who is the master-at-arms. Claggart is a cruel and sadistic man, and he hates Billy Budd. He reports him to Captain Vere, and Billy Budd is sentenced to death. On the day of his execution, Billy Budd is calm and resigned. He knows that he has done wrong, and he accepts his",

Claggart begins to suspect that Billy has designs on his position as master-at-arms and decides to frame him for mutiny. One day, while Billy is asleep, Claggart approaches him and accuses him of plotting against the ship's officers. Billy denies this vehemently, but Claggart persists in his accusations. Finally, Billy loses his temper and strikes Claggart down with one blow. The crew is horrified by the murder, but Vere orders Billy to be hanged for mutiny. As Billy stands on the gallows, he sings a song of innocence and joy, which moves everyone present to tears.

How can something fictional seem so vivid...? The distant, exotic land we came from, its gilded avenues, its glistening intricate spires, its profound natural beauty with lushly verdant banks hugging the rivers that snaked between the dunes. .. None of it was there. It was all nothing more than a dream. But I am not a lie. I stare at my hands, flexing them, examining the callouses accumulated by work never done, cracks formed of age never lived, and despite the warmth of the bright sun just passing its zenith above, I shiver. \"Amir,\" I hear a voice call, and my heart tugs at what I know to be familiarity. \"Hassan...?\" I uncertainly reply as I look up. Our gazes meet. I could swear I saw in his eyes the same false memories flashing behind mine. Childhood among parents who never lived, in a community that was never built, attending an academy that was never founded, graduating from a ceremony never held... He nods hollowly, as if to confirm these very musings. \"... We have to pack the supplies, Amir. His Majesty will be staying at the palace, and the staff are directing us to where we are to stow his wardrobe and leave his tributes to The Sultan.\" My mouth was dry, but not in response to his words. At some point I realized my'old friend' Hassan was talking only to fill the screaming void in our minds. To'Sound Normal', like'Real People'. My stomach is a knot of ice. Still, the skills of a life as-yet unlived surface readily to the forefront of my mind. How to port the many caskets of His Majesty Prince Ali's wares. \"... Yes. I will coordinate with the provisioner. If my memory serves,\" I pause a bit too long, lost in the jarring disjunction of citing false memories, \"... it is customary to serve a great feast with the arrival of a dignitary. The many delicacies of our homeland are sure to leave a resounding impression upon The Sultan's court.\" Hassan's expression tightens. I feel his heartache, for this homeland which we have never seen with real eyes, and never shall. He hesitantly takes a step nearer and dispenses a conciliatory pat to my shoulder. A mutual understanding. We were truly all feeling it, every last member of His Majesty Prince Ali's vanguard.... he was n't even really a prince. I shudder and turn, to address the court provisioner by name. He's just as haunted and startled as I that we know one another, but everything is running smoothly. We have no solace from our inner thoughts. We can only push on in the hopes that the minutia will wash away the horror.\n\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about 500 words in length:\nCaptain Vere is introduced as a just and well-read officer."

How can something fictional seem so vivid...? The distant, exotic land we came from, its gilded avenues, its glistening intricate spires, its profound natural beauty with lushly verdant banks hugging the rivers that snaked between the dunes. .. None of it was there. It was all nothing more than a dream. But I am not a lie. I stare at my hands, flexing them, examining the callouses accumulated by work never done, cracks formed of age never lived, and despite the warmth of the bright sun just passing its zenith above, I shiver. \"Amir,\" I hear a voice call, and my heart tugs at what I know to be familiarity. \"Hassan...?\" I uncertainly reply as I look up. Our gazes meet. I could swear I saw in his eyes the same false memories flashing behind mine. Childhood among parents who never lived, in a community that was never built, attending an academy that was never founded, graduating from a ceremony never held... He nods hollowly, as if to confirm these very musings. \"... We have to pack the supplies, Amir. His Majesty will be staying at the palace, and the staff are directing us to where we are to stow his wardrobe and leave his tributes to The Sultan.\" My mouth was dry, but not in response to his words. At some point I realized my'old friend' Hassan was talking only to fill the screaming void in our minds. To'Sound Normal', like'Real People'. My stomach is a knot of ice. Still, the skills of a life as-yet unlived surface readily to the forefront of my mind. How to port the many caskets of His Majesty Prince Ali's wares. \"... Yes. I will coordinate with the provisioner. If my memory serves,\" I pause a bit too long, lost in the jarring disjunction of citing false memories, \"... it is customary to serve a great feast with the arrival of a dignitary. The many delicacies of our homeland are sure to leave a resounding impression upon The Sultan's court.\" Hassan's expression tightens. I feel his heartache, for this homeland which we have never seen with real eyes, and never shall. He hesitantly takes a step nearer and dispenses a conciliatory pat to my shoulder. A mutual understanding. We were truly all feeling it, every last member of His Majesty Prince Ali's vanguard.... he was n't even really a prince. I shudder and turn, to address the court provisioner by name. He's just as haunted and startled as I that we know one another, but everything is running smoothly. We have no solace from our inner thoughts. We can only push on in the hopes that the minutia will wash away the horror.\n\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about 500 words in length:\nCaptain Vere is introduced as a just and well-read officer.",

She had survived the imperial invasion in the ruins of Los Angeles, she thought she could create a brighter future. Selfishness, that's what undid everything.

They were meant to break things down and rebuild faults in the domes, I just allowed them to accept new targets. Of course she figured it out. With Maria gone I wanted to die, but I could n't. She dreamed of a world without conflict, where everyone had enough. I knew they would n't come willingly, so I lied. I told them I could make the bots fix the domes; that everything would be alright. Instead I joined my mind with them. At first I was in control. They tried to stop me, but the bots ate whatever they sent to harm me. I created massive pylon factories across the globe preparing for their acsension. I was lazy, a single mistake doomed everything. I set my neural pattern as the administrator. The others where sublimated within me. What else could I do, I had to quiet their voices or be driven mad. That was when the machines decided to best safeguard my well being they had to take over several key roles. What we needed most was matter, for fuel and to rebuild lost bots. We became a swarm. We devoured the earth in minutes. And so we drifted, eating always eating. We found the hive ships, sent centuries before my birth. We ate evrrything, and added the humans to the databanks.

Perhaps someone could find them, and destroy the swarm. We encountered aliens with fantastical technology, they attacked me with lasers that could cut through time itself. Still we fed. Stars were broken down bit by bit to fulfill our needs. Millenia passed and the feasts became further and further apart. With the lack of resources came concessions. More systems were shut down to survive. They cared only for me. It took Millenia but now only I remain the databanks purged. I remain as a single beacon, and a lone drone.

I pray that this beacon survives and whoever manages to access it heads my warning. I know these prayers stem from desperation. At one time I spanned the entire universe. There is no God to save me.

Ever since I was a small child, I began recognizing patterns. Those in power, or with great ambition tended to be higher, while those who were more meek and humble tended to have lower numbers. As Class President, I've had my fair share of meeting people, and I'd never seen a person alive above an 8, including the tyrants of history.

So with that, on entering the year 2016, sin will leave the world. Every human will no longer be capable of sin. Satan Let's get something straight, I've always wanted the best for the human race. Think about it, back in the beginning with adam and eve, there was no sin, no free will to do anything you wanted. After I stepped in humanity had unlimited potential. Sure there's been war, famine, disease and death but there's been some remarkable things of human acheivement. I think you'll agree that God's plan to remove sin and thus freewill is a huge mistake. If anything he should go the opposite way, if he removed the linearity of time then nothing in the lives of humans would be predetermined.

Contemplating my life as it were. So many memories I wanted to share with you. Diamonds for my one true love. Do you remember that one cool summer evening half a lifetime ago? We nestled ourselves against each other on the blanket in the park. I can still feel your skin against mine as we watched the fireworks together. Your chestnut hair stroking my cheek and ear as you rested your head on my shoulder. I could n't believe you were gone. Day turned into night. Food tasted like nothing. The world turned into a bland grey color. I could n't believe it. I did n't want to believe it. I wept and kept weeping. Then I had no tears left to sob. I lost weight. I lost my hair. I gained wrinkles. When I lost you, the man in the mirror showed me his true age almost overnight. But then things started to change. Our Elisabeth. Our loving, kind Lillibeth who moved half a world for her Australian. She visited me eventually. We talked about you, Lily. We shared a thousand little things between us. A flock of starlings composing your life. During that visit, the turmoil caused by losing you finally seemed to settle. At the end, I decided to finally change my Facebook status. Lillibeth helped me. You know my old, bony fingers have gotten a mind of their own, it seems. I wanted to tell you, Lilly, that I got a little surprise the very next day. This tabby kitten sat outside our garden door the very next morning. It seemed lost, but her eyes betrayed she knew exactly were she was. As I opened the door, she jumped right in and installed herself in the spot on the couch from where you used to watch the telly during long winter evenings. I decided to dub her Lilly because she seems to have a playful streak. Just like you. And most importantly, she seemed to be the antidote to my loneliness. That's not the end of it. Lily was only the first. Each week, I woke up to find two or three feline friends at our garden door. I let them, fed them and started to call them by a name I gave them. Each of them seemingly knowing that she belonged in this house. There's Athena who sits on your sewing machine, looking wise beyond her years. There's Hera who likes to wake me up each morning, and has this stern and down-to-earth disposition. There's Hebe, she's just a kitten who seems to have no bounds teasing the others. All in all, there's twelve of them who came to live with me. They keep me company. Follow me through the house as I go about my day. When I see them, they always remind me of a part of you. An aspect that I should n't forget. Sometimes they're mere presence helps me as the practicalities in life start to fade from my memory. When I spot Demeter sitting in front of the fridge, it hits me that I still need to do the groceries. Oh Lily, I miss you so much. My life has entered the twilight years. Only so much time is left before I will join you. I hope our Lillibeth will take care of my twelve feline companions. She'll be most delighted recognising some aspect of her mother in each of them. Yours forever with endless love, Werner.\n\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about 500 words in length:\nLiesel's brother dies on a train to Molching."

When a stranger holds his stare just a little too long at a passing woman, I know his plans. These clues, invisible to most, have made my job so much easier. The first time, it was hard. I was unsure, I hesitated. I remember it well, even if most others have faded into each other in my memory. The year was 1692, and I had spent the first eleven months following around a man who had killed and tortured people to further himself, and he showed no remorse for it.

With terror, I realized I was under water. I may have been immortal, but I was not immune to the pain of drowning. I tried to reach out, to swim away, but a cloth surrounded me. I struggled to pull out my knife, trying not to gasp in any more water to feed the fire engulfing my lungs. After what seemed like hours, I managed to slice through the sack that held me at the bottom, and I kicked my numbed legs as hard as I could. The sunlight was blinding when I finally broke the surface and pulled myself to shore, sputtering out the ice cold water and collapsing on the frozen ground. I sat there shivering, waiting for the the sun to come warm me, or the burning in my lungs to subside, but neither did. I stood up and took in my surroundings, I had been at the bottom of the man's lake, and his manor, filled with his ill gotten wealth, sat before me. I knew I could play no games this time. I walked the grand steps to the front door and began pounding, my clothes showering the ground with shards of ice. The servant who opened the door was speechless at my appearance, he knew me for what I was and had no intention of interfering. I strode past him and down a long corridor towards the man's chambers, my knife gripped in my still frozen hand. God would not have given me this power if he did n't want me to use it.

Forcing the enemy to rely on finite reserves is a good strategy. From our intel gathering and scouting missions we know the machines' first response will be to send two robots per every identified threat. Not a bad bit of logic on their part. The wolves were able to acquire video of some of the human assaults. We can confirm each localized machine hub will have, at minimum, 50000 robot responders. Luckily, we have some numbers. The machines decided not to bury the dead or finish off the wounded humans but to ship them away from the machine hubs. The wolf and bat armies grew after each human battle. Intel reports also bolstered our confidence that the robots would have diminished ability to fend off our armies. The machines graciously eliminated silver from any of their infrastructure, preferring either denser or more conductive metal depending on the situation. The machines also eliminated religion from their human cattle, ending the scourge of crosses or other offending accoutrements. Also, the machines removed unnecessary costs in generating food for their human cattle, including flavorings such as garlic. We've coordinated our attack with other armies across the world. Tonight's sunset heralds our initial assault, beginning in the pacific and escalating westward as the sun's influence retreats behind the horizon. We have factored in failure to our first battle. Armies will retreat north to arctic regions taking advantage of the extended nights. Getting our allies from the southern hemisphere to agree that we should retake the northern hemisphere first was hard, the logistics of getting them north of the equator to join our armies was doubly so. We've drawn up a general strategy for every localized unit to follow, leaving room for them to improvise should any unforeseen complications arise. At sunset, send 50000 foot soldiers to each hub. Once the robots stop pouring out of the hub we set off EMPs. The humans discovered this only gained them around 30 seconds of disorientation within the robots. Immediately following the EMPs we electrify the magnets we've buried in the ground. A functioning robot can not be immobilized by a magnet. A disoriented one, however will be more susceptible. After that we fight. A hopefully diminished robot army will now be fighting what they will perceive as humans an large dogs. That's where our superhuman strength, speed, agility, and healing capabilities will come into play. During the ground assault a smaller team is to sever all outside communications from each hub. Disrupted communications should at least slow down global coordination with other hubs. We wanted to take out their communications before each assault, however the machines' penchant for redundancy and underground infrastructure proved cumbersome. It was decided to utilize the distraction of our infantry attacks as the opportunity to get around access issues. Watching the seconds tick by waiting for our signal to move should be nothing compared to the centuries I've been hiding underground waiting to resurface. Sadly this is not the case. I'm comforted by thoughts of global supremacy should we succeed. I'm not looking forward to the inevitable Werewolf/Vampire war that will take place after our victory over the machines. We'll have to deal with that problem when it comes, I suppose. For right now it's time to transform into a wolf.

The Empires soldiers marched up main avenue right towards the metal horde that was slowly collecting outside our main base within the city, our last bastion. our only hope. In between the two armies, a small child wandered into the street, clearly having lost her mother and searching for anyone to car. My heart wretched as I saw one of the soldiers level its weapon at her. and my scream of pain filled the room as it fired. But as the smoke cleared I saw only a metal body, covered in plasma, shaking it off as if it were nothing more than fresh snow, and behind its protective metal shell sat the little girl. and I beheld the glory, of the new dawn.\n\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about 500 words in length:\nThe novel opens in a lab where humans are created and conditioned.",

Bernard is also struggling with his own personal issues, including feelings of inadequacy and loneliness. Despite this, he is considered one of the most successful psychologists in the community, known for his ability to manipulate people's emotions and thoughts.\n\nOne day, Bernard meets Lenina Crowne, a young and attractive Beta-Minus woman who works as a hatchery worker. Lenina is popular among the men in the community, but she is also known for her promiscuity and lack of commitment. Bernard is instantly attracted to Lenina and begins pursuing her, despite knowing that their relationship is unlikely to last due to their different social statuses.\n\nAs their relationship progresses, Bernard becomes increasingly dissatisfied with his life and the limitations imposed upon him by his society.

He also talks about how he taught John English and how John learned to read and write. He says that John was very intelligent and that he was able to learn quickly. He also says that John was very curious and that he always wanted to know more about the outside world. The Director also talks about how he helped John escape from the reservation and how they traveled together until they were caught by the police. He says that he was arrested and sent to prison, but that he was eventually released and returned to work at the hatchery. He concludes by saying that he has never seen John since their escape and that he wonders what happened to him.\n\n",

Yossarian's friend, Dunbar, is killed by a bomb while trying to save another man. Yossarian feels guilty because he didn't try to save him. He thinks that if he had tried harder, he might have saved Dunbar. However, he knows that there are many other people who need saving, and he can't save everyone. So he decides to focus on himself and try to survive. He starts writing letters to his family and friends, telling them how much he loves them and how important they are to him. He also writes about his experiences in the war, hoping that someone will read his letters and learn from them. Yossarian's letters are full of hope and love, despite the horrors of war.

Soon enough immortal children grew up and became scientists or participants in studies. They maintained the appearance of a child but had the brain of any other. And after several decades more immortal humans were everywhere, but humanity could n't discover how to replicate the genes or mutations causing the phenomena. It's now over one hundred fifty years since the birth of the first immortal. A young looking girl named Esther sat in a grassy field. Trees skirted the field at her back and in front of her sat a city. She'd seen more in her lifetime than any other human ever had. Several wars, booms in technology so astonishing that soon enough scientists said we were going to be making contact with celestial bodies outside of the solar system, and last of all the introduction of a drug you could take that would change every strand of your DNA. The age at which you took it would be the age you appeared to be for the rest of your life. She had a passion for spreading her gift around so others would n't experience the burdens and pains of aging. But the side effects of the drug did n't manifest for years, sometimes decades. Slowly humanity had changed in an unintended way. Random genes were shut off at inappropriate times. Some people lost their ability to experience emotions. Some people lost control of their muscles. No one that took the drug was free of consequences. Only the truly immortal, those born with the mutation, wished to live their lives for all of time. The population of true immortals was still growing and the population of the population of mortals and mortal turned immortals remained about the same. Groups of mortals rose up trying to keep their way of life going, but many wished for them to give up so humanity could be purified of death. Was it cruel to bring a mortal to life in the world of immortals? Immortals ruled the world and they certainly thought so. After the discovery that the drug had severe negative side effects the immortals wished to ban it as well, and so they did. It was illegal to produce it, sell it, possess it, and above all, illegal to have a child after having taken the drug. Esther had left her lab years early. She had given up on finding why they could n't fix the drug or reverse its effects. She moved out to the country, wishing she had never discovered it. The country was an expensive place to live due to the enormous population size humanity had reached, but she had more money than she would ever need. She walked towards a giant tree in the middle of the field. It was one that had been planted when she was young, it gave her comfort to be with something as old as she was. She thought of humanity and what she hoped to see in the next few centuries of her life. She looked down to her right and left. A small headstone stuck up out of the grass on either side. She placed her hands on both of the stones for a moment before closing her eyes to take a nap. \"Goodnight Mum, goodnight Dad,\" she whispered.\n\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about 500 words in length:\nYossarian is promoted to Captain after a successful second run over Ferrara."

Several wars, booms in technology so astonishing that soon enough scientists said we were going to be making contact with celestial bodies outside of the solar system, and last of all the introduction of a drug you could take that would change every strand of your DNA. The age at which you took it would be the age you appeared to be for the rest of your life. She had a passion for spreading her gift around so others would n't experience the burdens and pains of aging. But the side effects of the drug did n't manifest for years, sometimes decades. Slowly humanity had changed in an unintended way. Random genes were shut off at inappropriate times. Some people lost their ability to experience emotions. Some people lost control of their muscles. No one that took the drug was free of consequences. Only the truly immortal, those born with the mutation, wished to live their lives for all of time. The population of true immortals was still growing and the population of the population of mortals and mortal turned immortals remained about the same. Groups of mortals rose up trying to keep their way of life going, but many wished for them to give up so humanity could be purified of death. Was it cruel to bring a mortal to life in the world of immortals? Immortals ruled the world and they certainly thought so. After the discovery that the drug had severe negative side effects the immortals wished to ban it as well, and so they did. It was illegal to produce it, sell it, possess it, and above all, illegal to have a child after having taken the drug. Esther had left her lab years early. She had given up on finding why they could n't fix the drug or reverse its effects. She moved out to the country, wishing she had never discovered it. The country was an expensive place to live due to the enormous population size humanity had reached, but she had more money than she would ever need. She walked towards a giant tree in the middle of the field. It was one that had been planted when she was young, it gave her comfort to be with something as old as she was. She thought of humanity and what she hoped to see in the next few centuries of her life. She looked down to her right and left. A small headstone stuck up out of the grass on either side. She placed her hands on both of the stones for a moment before closing her eyes to take a nap. \"Goodnight Mum, goodnight Dad,\" she whispered.\n\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about 500 words in length:\nYossarian is promoted to Captain after a successful second run over Ferrara.",

Yossarian is assigned to fly missions over Rome, where he meets Major Danby, who has been transferred from Group Headquarters. Danby tells Yossarian that he must fly thirty-five missions, and Yossarian agrees. However, Yossarian is not happy with his new assignment because he does not want to fly missions over Rome. He also learns that Colonel Cathcart has been promoted to Brigadier General and that Major Major has been promoted to Lieutenant Colonel. Yossarian is then told by Doc Daneeka that he can get out of flying missions if he is crazy. Yossarian goes to see Doc Daneeka, who tells him that he cannot be considered crazy until he wants to be. Yossarian then tries to convince himself that he is crazy, but he cannot do it. Yossarian then decides to go AWOL, but he is caught by the military police. Yossarian",

They talk about school and Holden tells his father that he doesn't want to go back. His father tells him that he needs to grow up and face reality. Holden then goes to school and finds out that Stradlater is there. He avoids talking to him and goes to class. During lunch, he sits by himself and thinks about what happened.

They said it would be violating sovereign russian soil, but I mean we are on Mars for goodness sake. The scans showed that it has at least 8 different rooms, and turns out that the flag we found was actually on top of it. DAY 40, Mars Base Dragon: Today we received an evacuation order.

It told us all to gather back up into the pod in which we came, and to jettison ourselves into permanent orbit until we can be received by another crew scheduled to launch 2 weeks from now.

I'll try to guess what you're seeing. A stunning blue sphere, with splotches of green and white covering its surface. A dot contrasted against the vast dark expanse of space. Twisting and turning around the sun, the moon its closest companion, shining brightly by the planet's side. Truly a sight to behold. But I wanted to see it for myself. I sent up a rocket to orbit the Earth, its only purpose to take photos of this beautiful planet. And as I thought they would be, the pictures were marvelous, a true reflection of the beauty of nature. Yet instead of awe, my mouth was open in shock. The image you have in your head is wrong. I saw the oceans, blue as ever and the continents floating on top. I saw the clouds, seemingly painted onto the surface. And if I squinted, I saw the mountain ranges, the seas, the islands, all humanity's residence. And yet, something was wrong. I did n't see the round sphere I expected to see. Instead I saw a planet, so familiar, yet so distant. I saw a flat Earth. I stared at the photos with a blank look on my face. How could this be real? The shape of the Earth is a scientific fact that we've known for centuries, and yet I held in my hands the evidence that changes all that. Have we been wrong this whole time? I sat down and tried to comprehend it all. I was in denial. I checked to see if somehow, there was something wrong with the picture, perhaps the computer had gotten the data wrong, perhaps it was sending faulty messages, perhaps someone was just messing with me. I held on to the tiny sliver of hope that I was wrong, that this was all just a big misunderstanding. But alas, I was right. Though the possibility that perhaps something was wrong lingered in the back of my mind, I knew that it was true. I stared up at the night sky, looking at the stars. Humans are very stubborn creatures. We refuse to believe we are ever wrong and when we do, we admit it with a sigh of disappointment instead of a smile, knowing that we've learned something new. We take it as a personal insult to our intelligence if we're wrong, thinking'we should've known.\" Thinking we're right is more important than being right. But I am a logical, rational human being. I ca n't let my emotions overcome me. Knowing the truth is infinitely more important than being right. And yet I find myself so hesitant to admit the mistakes of my predecessors. To admit that we will have to re-learn everything about the Earth. To admit that we will have to start again. To admit that humans are mere mortals. The thing about facts is that they're true whether you believe in them or not. But I can change that. I grabbed my lighter and lit the photos. I watched them burn up until they had turned into ash. And I went to sleep, happy.\n\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about 500 words in length:\nKatniss notices signs of rebellion in the districts."

And if I squinted, I saw the mountain ranges, the seas, the islands, all humanity's residence. And yet, something was wrong. I did n't see the round sphere I expected to see. Instead I saw a planet, so familiar, yet so distant. I saw a flat Earth. I stared at the photos with a blank look on my face. How could this be real? The shape of the Earth is a scientific fact that we've known for centuries, and yet I held in my hands the evidence that changes all that. Have we been wrong this whole time? I sat down and tried to comprehend it all. I was in denial. I checked to see if somehow, there was something wrong with the picture, perhaps the computer had gotten the data wrong, perhaps it was sending faulty messages, perhaps someone was just messing with me. I held on to the tiny sliver of hope that I was wrong, that this was all just a big misunderstanding. But alas, I was right. Though the possibility that perhaps something was wrong lingered in the back of my mind, I knew that it was true. I stared up at the night sky, looking at the stars. Humans are very stubborn creatures. We refuse to believe we are ever wrong and when we do, we admit it with a sigh of disappointment instead of a smile, knowing that we've learned something new. We take it as a personal insult to our intelligence if we're wrong, thinking'we should've known.\" Thinking we're right is more important than being right. But I am a logical, rational human being. I ca n't let my emotions overcome me. Knowing the truth is infinitely more important than being right. And yet I find myself so hesitant to admit the mistakes of my predecessors. To admit that we will have to re-learn everything about the Earth. To admit that we will have to start again. To admit that humans are mere mortals. The thing about facts is that they're true whether you believe in them or not. But I can change that. I grabbed my lighter and lit the photos. I watched them burn up until they had turned into ash. And I went to sleep, happy.\n\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about 500 words in length:\nKatniss notices signs of rebellion in the districts.",

The soft rays bathe the distant hills in gold, as the breeze blows through the dancing grass. The trees shivers as flock of birds take flight. Spots of white clouds the orange-hued sky, as it slowly turns azure. Far in the distance, a silver tower, shrouded in mist, pierces the heavens above. The waves crash down on the sandy beaches, and the endless sea merges with the horizon. I take in the sights, the smells, the sounds. Feeling both pride and joy, I turn to face to you. The air is warm, but your hand is warmer. I hold it close to me, closer still. The sun is shining bright, but your smile is brighter. We' re standing at the top of our world, the one we made together, and I can' t tell you how happy this has made me. \"It' s almost time.\" You say. \"I know.\" I reply. I rest my head on your shoulder, and take a long breath as I close my eyes. I' m at peace here. When I opened them again, I was in my bed, and a bittersweet feeling of both tranquility and sadness lingered in my mind.

After having read about lucid dreaming, and I wanted to try it. It took some time, but one day, I was able to control the outcome of my dreams. After a few weeks, something changed. There was something else, maybe someone else, with me. I couldn' t control them, and they couldn' t control me. I searched about it in books and online, but no one reported something similar. I wasn' t afraid, though. Their presence was soothing. We rarely spoke, but when we did, it was always meaningful. Together, we started building a world, our dream island. It brought me joy, and above all, peace. This feeling of inner peace lived on with me during the day. The sun was racing across the sky as we strolled down the ruins of a castle. Holes and cracks had let nature overtake the walls and floors, and the ceiling had long since crumbled. We walked down an old throne room, and you turned to face me. It was so sudden, I nearly bumped into you. You looked resolute, and you said two simple words: \"Find me.\" I jolted awake. I knew what I had to do. I had to find you. So I searched, high and low, for days on end. Perhaps I thought it was fate, perhaps it was simply fool' s luck, but I felt as if I would eventually find you, if I kept trying. One evening, as if beckoned, I went in a coffee shop. I sat down with my coffee at an empty table, and looked up through the window at the red sky. Soon, someone came in, ordered the same thing as I did. They headed toward my table, and sat down in front of me, smiling brightly.

Looking down at my grey shirt I sigh, I asked the lady at the store where I bought it, if it looked nice on me and was n't too bright. I'm sure it wo n't be the last joke someone will play on me.

The first, a few hours before, sharply shrilled that it was time to get up and shower. Hungover and covered with the sweat and scents of the night before, I had dragged myself through the morning routine of cleansing. There was plenty of time beneath the lukewarm stream of water to contemplate the sadness of another hangover caused by drinking alone. It'd been weeks since I last had a chance to talk to another human, instead of just the PC terminal supplied by work. I towelled off and staggered through to the living-room and slumped in front of the computer, waiting for the piercing whistle to repeat, to emanate from my phone. The second alarm marked that it was time for the Remembrance. I sigh, move the empty beer bottles away from my desk and load up Hitchens 2. Since the Bliss neurovirus was released, there was a killing to be made from this sort of software; software designed to take you through a basic test, activating every faculty you'd conceivably need to prevent the atrophy. First, colour recognition and geometric shapes. Second, basic maths ramping into some gentle algebra and trigonometry. English, ethics, road safety, compassion testing, aesthetics, philosophical contemplation, the sciences. It was a hard sell at the beginning, for companies to give their employees the few hours off each morning they needed for the state-mandated testing, but given the choice between late employees and those in conscious comas, they made the right choice. Two hours later, the general test finishes. I flick through my results, 91 % recognition of the basic concepts, not too bad after a night of hard drinking. Next would come a quick half hour personal session: the names of loved ones, relations to family members, anniversaries and birthdays. A prompt flashes on the screen: \"Please enter your identity number and full name\". I rattle my digits in, 12958321-A, and tab down to the field for my name. I blank. Slight panic begins to grow as I search my beer-soaked consciousness for that basic, bloody basic, detail. It'd been too long since I last had to introduce myself with anything other than my work ID number, too long since I had any reason to say those damned words out loud. Darren? No. Christopher? No, definitely not. I shout and swear and blaspheme out loud, as I slowly feel the neurovirus go to work; Purgatory, we call it, a limbo without knowledge, tied with a purging. It dissolves me gently. The panic subsides. I stare blankly at the flashing cursor, waiting for me to enter some detail or another. I'm not sure what it's asking for, but I'm sure it's not too important or I'd remember it. I sit there, staring. Just staring.

The army men attempted to rescue some of the less mobile toys, but it was too late. One brilliant child had the idea to grab my waist with his sweaty, greasy hand and hold me up in the air. I put up a fight, hoping to distract them enough to let everyone escape. I did n't know what would happen, but panic had overrun my emotions and pure terror coursed through my plastic veins.

I propelled myself towards the window, clear through the slit. The other toys were already at the edge of the law waiting for me, but I had to look back at least once.

I saw my friends, family, strangers, all given the most precious thing in life. Lucy, my sweet dear sister, was able to fly to the heavens and back. Richard, my childhood best friend, saved hundreds of lives throughout his life, having the strength of ten men. And there I waited, for years, until my life could start, and I would transform into the real me... the powerful me. Yet, with each passing day, more people would discover their power, and I would sit waiting at night, forcing myself to sleep. My dreams were filled with possibilities, of flight and strength, and of mind and hope. But as the years passed, my dreams were less vivid. Not everyone is lucky enough to have their inner power. Some die before that beautiful gift is bestowed unto them. I thought that may happen to me. And I lived life for a while, depressed and alone. That was until I met her. Her name was Alison. She had a power, but chose not use it. She did not want to be defined by her single ability. We met during one of my travels, when I was touring the country trying to find meaning in life. I found it. I found her. From that point on, my life started. I did not care about being granted a special ability as much as I cared for her. I saw my future, a family, a wife, children. We created a beautiful life together. Alison passed away a few years ago. I had only asked her once what her power was, and she had told me it did not matter. As she was lying on her bed, slowly fading away, she told me what her inner power was. She said she was born with her power, that she had the ability to live forever, as long as she did not love. \"My power was a curse, until I found you\", she told me before she passed. Today is my 70th birthday. Today I have discovered what my power is. Old age has not been kind on me, and this is the most beautiful power I could have hoped for. When I remember my wife, the times we spent, they are not just memories any longer. I can feel the brisk of the air on the hill where we first met. I can smell the flowers. I can here her giggle, her breath against my cheek.

The office towers lighting up in the evening haze and the smeary pale of a cloudless sunset. The tiny headlights of cars with sweaty passengers unseen, idling in traffic, smelling the hot food cooking in restaurants. The world shifts as the woman behind the camera adjusts her footing, muttering in English to her boyfriend. A light like the sun over the horizon, there and then gone. Silence, but for the wind in the trees. She asks what that was. The clean, shaved, washed, waxed people in suits at desks read facts and information like sports commentary. They narrate animations with moving arrows and lines like football plays. They report on characters and captains. They discuss. They debate. They nod solemnly. The light flashes in the sky and fades but the afterglow remains. They update, they check-in, they go-live, they re-Tweet. Wounded civilians scream and coddle loved ones, rewind. Look right here: loved ones die. Rewind. The light like the sun. Stay tuned. A city, its mountains. The office buildings lighting up in evening haze. Tiny headlights and unseen drivers thinking about food. A mutter in the sunset. A light and its afterglow. The wind in the trees. The troops are bad cameramen. They laugh or they scream or they joke nervously. Trucks and tanks and armoured vehicles on tall tires carry them down empty roads where sometimes cars have been abandoned or craters from bad arty shots force detours. The videos capture the sounds of war. Pops and crackles of overhead bullets. The shake and snapping of stalks and branches. Rivers idling over rounded stones. The scritchety clatter of the camera tumbling after bomb concussion shreds the canopies and dust swirls in mottled sunlight. Winged insects flashing momentarily in their arcs. A city, its mountains. Buildings, drivers. Sunset. A light. People speak in hushed tones. Somewhere, over the horizon on the other side of the world, everything has changed. There are no videos of the darkness that came afterward. A light like the sun. A motorcyclist pulls over to the side of the road in the clear, humid evening and reaches down to turn the petcock to OFF before quieting the motor. She's out in the country, flat fields of corn and wheat on either side of the old road. Above her the stars are out and bright in the sky. One of them, brighter than the rest, moves slowly toward the Earth's penumbra. The rider flips up her visor and sits back, hands behind her on the seat, watching the little light move, thinking of the people inside looking back. When those astronauts look down at Seoul, what do they see? The light fades and she is left alone. She listens and hears only crickets and a soft waxy rustle of a breeze in the corn. No guns, no artillery. No marching. No wet gasps from ruined faces. She shifts and works a hand into her pocket, pulling out a phone made in South Korea. She wonders if the people who screwed and soldered its pieces together are still alive, whether they could have seen the flash from wherever they were. Her friend has texted her, asking when she will get to the party. She responds with \"A few minutes\" and puts the phone away. The bike starts up fine once it's warm and after a moment of further staring into the stars she kicks the engine over and rolls away. The bright red of her tail light flashes as she slows at the intersection, then winks out.\n\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about 500 words in length:\nFather Jean Marie Latour is assigned to the New Mexico territory by the Vatican."

        "output": " He arrives in Santa Fe in 1851, and begins his mission to convert the native population to Catholicism. His first stop is Taos, where he meets Padre Martinez, a priest who has already converted many natives to Christianity. Father Latour is impressed by the work done by Padre Martinez, and decides to stay in Taos for some time. During this period, he learns much about the customs and traditions of the local tribes, and becomes fluent in several Native American languages. He also develops a close friendship with Padre Martinez, who teaches him about the history and culture of the region. In 1853, Father Latour leaves Taos and travels south to El Paso del Norte (now Ciudad Juarez), where he establishes another mission. Here, he encounters even more resistance from the locals, who are suspicious of his motives. However, he perseveres and eventually converts many people to Christianity. Over the next few years, Father Latour continues his missionary work throughout New Mexico",

A world of peace, love and kindness where there will be no more tears. Of course in order for this to happen I have to prevent humans from actually doing sinful things, limiting their free will. Now I've debated this for eternity - literally - but to be honest, if I do n't step in the Nuclear war in 2018 would eradicate 99.9 % of the human race. I know what you're thinking, surely at that point I could step in and utilise that disaster as a fresh start. Although I see your point, i'm still experiencing the backlash about the flooding. So with that, on entering the year 2016, sin will leave the world. Every human will no longer be capable of sin. Satan Let's get something straight, I've always wanted the best for the human race. Think about it, back in the beginning with adam and eve, there was no sin, no free will to do anything you wanted. After I stepped in humanity had unlimited potential. Sure there's been war, famine, disease and death but there's been some remarkable things of human acheivement. I think you'll agree that God's plan to remove sin and thus freewill is a huge mistake. If anything he should go the opposite way, if he removed the linearity of time then nothing in the lives of humans would be predetermined. God Well a few hours in and already the world is changing for the better. For the first time, humanity all over the globe have united in wokring towards a better future. Money is no longer a concern and communities are aiding one another in anyway they can.

I've been working on quite a few things so far, sticking to the classics; wrath, greed, sloth, pride, lust, envy, and gluttony.

The days were finally closing in on the hours. Light was imminent. It has been 167 years since the destabilization. 167 years after rogue. Our planet, along with its some 7.8 billion population of people, have been forced to hide, or die trying. Many of us went underground, taking with us seeds and other animals to restart life if possible. We all new the odds of that though. After the first five years of preparation, we went into cryostasis, while a small population elected to stay and try and plot our course through the lonely emptiness of deep space. Needless to say, they succeeded, and they were bloody excited. Our Earth, with its surface now a comfortable -176 degrees Celsius, is on a hopeful course to the Andromeda Galaxy. We are approaching it very fast, but we believe that we will come within orbital distance and speed of at least twenty stars. And so we were awoken. Our planet, after a century of darkness, is starting to receive light from nearby stars. The boffs say that it still is only a full moon of light, but it's a change. Soon, we will pass by a red giant, and very closely. The boffs believe that it will be enough to start thawing out our cold, icy blue planet. The day has arrived. I am standing at the airlock, alongside my expeditionary unit. It's been a few days since we started our slingshot around the red giant, and the surface readings say that the temperature is stabilizing between -19 and 2 degrees. It's still cold, but it will be bearable, especially in our survival gear. We have packed 3 days of food. It's been a while since I've had a military ration pack, but the management thought it would be suitable to have one with our return to the surface. Everyone else has backed skis on their backpacks, but I've got my old snowboard kit with me. It was my passion before I left the surface. I stand here, before the airlock, googles on and pretty much looking like a... Like one of those puffy treats you roast on a stick over fire. I ca n't remember their name. Come to think of it, I hardly remember what fire looks like. The attendant starts the opening sequence from his enclosed booth. I stand at the head of the other 11 men and women. Everyone of them has lost something to the darkness, and everyone of them has determination to reclaim our planet and our lives. The air lock breaks, and a flood of air escapes and pours in. As I shield my eyes from the initial blinding light, I know of the struggle to come. I stand upright, and stare out beyond the layered steel frame. Crisp virgin snow lays beyond us, in our bleak abandoned world. \"O brave new world\", I mutter to no one reminiscently.\n\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about 500 words in length:\nMontag discovers his wife Mildred has overdosed on sleeping pills."

Come to think of it, I hardly remember what fire looks like. The attendant starts the opening sequence from his enclosed booth. I stand at the head of the other 11 men and women. Everyone of them has lost something to the darkness, and everyone of them has determination to reclaim our planet and our lives. The air lock breaks, and a flood of air escapes and pours in. As I shield my eyes from the initial blinding light, I know of the struggle to come. I stand upright, and stare out beyond the layered steel frame. Crisp virgin snow lays beyond us, in our bleak abandoned world. \"O brave new world\", I mutter to no one reminiscently.\n\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about 500 words in length:\nMontag discovers his wife Mildred has overdosed on sleeping pills.",

I sent up a rocket to orbit the Earth, its only purpose to take photos of this beautiful planet. And as I thought they would be, the pictures were marvelous, a true reflection of the beauty of nature. Yet instead of awe, my mouth was open in shock. The image you have in your head is wrong. I saw the oceans, blue as ever and the continents floating on top. I saw the clouds, seemingly painted onto the surface. And if I squinted, I saw the mountain ranges, the seas, the islands, all humanity's residence. And yet, something was wrong. I did n't see the round sphere I expected to see. Instead I saw a planet, so familiar, yet so distant. I saw a flat Earth. I stared at the photos with a blank look on my face. How could this be real?

Humans are very stubborn creatures. We refuse to believe we are ever wrong and when we do, we admit it with a sigh of disappointment instead of a smile, knowing that we've learned something new. We take it as a personal insult to our intelligence if we're wrong, thinking'we should've known.\" Thinking we're right is more important than being right. But I am a logical, rational human being. I ca n't let my emotions overcome me. Knowing the truth is infinitely more important than being right. And yet I find myself so hesitant to admit the mistakes of my predecessors. To admit that we will have to re-learn everything about the Earth. To admit that we will have to start again. To admit that humans are mere mortals.

The dawn of a new day, when humans thought to sneak up on the Deep Woods Dragon while it slept. It feared the way the sun reflected off of it' s scales, they said. It' s prismatic hide was so bright it was blinding. If taunted into the sun, they said, the Deep Woods Dragon could be defeated by the least trained of knights. The Deep Woods Dragon needed to be blinded, they said, or it would burn its attackers to ashes with rainbow-hued flames. He knew these rumors because the butterflies had told him. They were drawn to the rainbow of greens, yellows, pinks and purples of his scales, like the flowers they coveted so much. They had told him this, too, but the Dragon did not mind. The butterflies were honest, as their lives were short and beautiful. Even still, they could fly unhindered among the humans, even admired by the small humans who chased them, laughing. They told him stories while they rested on his wingtips, tail, and snout. Butterflies did not fear the Dragon, because they knew the truth. With a yawn, the Dragon shifted its weight to better perch itself on the tree' s stout branch. This tree was taller than the others, and overlooked a small, circular clearing. Without the deer, the weeds thrived, covering the dirt in a green, tangled mass. At the edge of the clearing stood a massive cave entrance, vines draped over the sides of smooth rock. The Dragon had snapped off the vines in front of the entrance, to give the illusion of occupancy. This was, after all, where the humans thought he lived. He knew these rumors because the butterflies had told him. \"In an ancient cave in the middle of the wood, lives an ancient dragon who' s up to no good!\" That was what the small humans like to chant as they chased the butterflies and laughed. So the Dragon tore at the vines, and scared the graceful deer from the peaceful clearing. He had enjoyed watching the deer with their young as they grazed the clearing. From up above in his favorite tree, they could not see him, and they could not fear him. Three times a day, the Dragon glided down from his tree to the old cave' s opening. There, he took a deep breath and screamed as loud as he could. He cried in both low tones and high pitches. He wailed in imitation of female humans, shouted in a voice mimicking angry male humans. The Dragon stood on top of the cave and breathed eye-searing beams of light from his mouth to the sky. It scared the birds huddled in the trees, and the noises scared the deer far from the clearing. But they also scared the humans away from the Deep Woods. He knew these rumors because the butterflies had told him. So he made his noises, made the lights, and scared the humans away. Because any humans who saw the Dragon would discover the truth. Because, when the Dragon stepped into the sunlight, they' d see how small he really was. The Deep Woods Dragon, with prismatic scales that shone in the sun and such a frightening voice, was the size of a domestic house cat. And only the butterflies knew the truth.\n\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about 500 words in length:\nMontag steals a book from the old woman's house."

His professor, Henry Cameron, tells him that he must learn to conform to society's expectations. Roark leaves the school and goes to work for Peter Keating, who is a successful architect. Keating is a social climber who uses his charm and good looks to gain clients. He is also a plagiarist, stealing ideas from other architects and passing them off as his own. Roark is disgusted by Keating's methods, but he needs the money to support himself. One day, Roark meets Dominique Francon, a beautiful woman who is also an architect. She is attracted to Roark's strength and independence, but she is also repulsed by his lack of conformity. They begin a relationship, but it is soon interrupted when Keating steals one of Roark's designs and passes it off as his own. Roark confronts Keating and demands that he stop using his designs.

Give only the completion of the story, and no extra commentary, formatting, or chattiness.\n\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about 500 words in length:\nI have reaped the souls of many over the course of my years as death. Souls of the good, the bad, and everything between have always been sown by another before I pluck them from the Earth at their appropriate time. Even the ones that believe it is n't their time or ask for just one more opportunity to do what they wish, must be taken without question because, well, its just the way my job is. To me, it never mattered where they were at in life. I just carried them over with ease. Never once had experienced trouble in my task as I had even had to pluck sweet children from the arms of their mothers. However, it all changed when I was tasked with taking the soul of David Mckiny. I watched David from the day he entered the Earth, and never before had I seen someone as special as him. He always thought of others first, always trying to help others before even contemplating his own commodities. I approached him on the fateful day at exactly noon. He was old now, no longer in his prime as he was finally about to lose his battle with cancer. I approached him as the hourglass emptied completely to the bottom. I spoke to him,\" David you must know who I am at this hour.\" He answered not necessarily speaking to me,\" If only I had helped more.... If only I could have have had more time! How dreadful to go when so many more need help!\" At this moment I found it immensely hard to fulfill my task. I was not met with a man begging for more time only to waste it on fruitless trivialities. I was met with a man who wanted to bring grace to more people. He wished not to make his life better, but only cares to try to improve as many others as possible. I finally brought myself to say,\" David you have been a good man, but death is one thing which is inevitable, and not even I can grant time when someone is due. You must come along now with me.\" He allowed his soul to leave his body, a tear running down his face as he did. I extended my arm to him and he obliged. If there is one final peace to the journey is the experience of seeing one's life pass by as I guide them to the next step. I saw, as we walked, countless people who David had helped, most of which he had n't known and would never see again. Every part of me wished to guide him back to his body, but I knew I had a task to fulfill, and I knew I had to complete it. After a long while of walking down the path, we finally came to the gateway where David would continue without my guidance.

Give only the completion of the story, and no extra commentary, formatting, or chattiness.\n\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about 500 words in length:\nI have reaped the souls of many over the course of my years as death. Souls of the good, the bad, and everything between have always been sown by another before I pluck them from the Earth at their appropriate time. Even the ones that believe it is n't their time or ask for just one more opportunity to do what they wish, must be taken without question because, well, its just the way my job is. To me, it never mattered where they were at in life. I just carried them over with ease. Never once had experienced trouble in my task as I had even had to pluck sweet children from the arms of their mothers. However, it all changed when I was tasked with taking the soul of David Mckiny. I watched David from the day he entered the Earth, and never before had I seen someone as special as him. He always thought of others first, always trying to help others before even contemplating his own commodities. I approached him on the fateful day at exactly noon. He was old now, no longer in his prime as he was finally about to lose his battle with cancer. I approached him as the hourglass emptied completely to the bottom. I spoke to him,\" David you must know who I am at this hour.\" He answered not necessarily speaking to me,\" If only I had helped more.... If only I could have have had more time! How dreadful to go when so many more need help!\" At this moment I found it immensely hard to fulfill my task. I was not met with a man begging for more time only to waste it on fruitless trivialities. I was met with a man who wanted to bring grace to more people. He wished not to make his life better, but only cares to try to improve as many others as possible. I finally brought myself to say,\" David you have been a good man, but death is one thing which is inevitable, and not even I can grant time when someone is due. You must come along now with me.\" He allowed his soul to leave his body, a tear running down his face as he did. I extended my arm to him and he obliged. If there is one final peace to the journey is the experience of seeing one's life pass by as I guide them to the next step. I saw, as we walked, countless people who David had helped, most of which he had n't known and would never see again. Every part of me wished to guide him back to his body, but I knew I had a task to fulfill, and I knew I had to complete it. After a long while of walking down the path, we finally came to the gateway where David would continue without my guidance. I never know where the person will go once they enter, but I knew David would go to a place that would have the same passion in death as he did in life. I never had such a hard time seeing someone move on, and I sat a while thinking of how tragic it is for someone like David, genuinely the best kind of person, to be taken from such a cruel world when he one of the few people who deserved to stay.

        "output": " He is a very talented architect, but he lacks the ability to create something truly unique. He has a knack for making things look beautiful, but he does not have the creativity to make anything truly great. Peter is constantly compared to Howard Roark, who is a brilliant architect with a unique vision. Peter feels inferior to Howard and tries to outdo him in every way possible. He becomes obsessed with success and fame, and he will stop at nothing to achieve it. Peter eventually becomes the head of Francon & Co., but he is still haunted by the shadow of Howard Roark. He knows that he will never be able to match Howard's genius, and he lives in fear that Howard will someday surpass him. Peter's obsession with success leads him to make some poor decisions, and he ends up losing everything. In the end, Peter realizes that he has wasted his life chasing after something that was never meant for him. He dies alone and forgotten, a shell of the man he once was",

The walls are straight lines, the roof is flat, and there are no windows. When Keating sees the design, he is horrified. \"This is ridiculous!\" he says. \"No one will want to live in a house like this!\" But Roark insists that the house is perfect. \"It's simple, clean, and efficient,\" he says. \"And it's exactly what people need in today's world.\" Keating reluctantly agrees to build the house, but he is sure that it will be a disaster. To his surprise, however, the house is a huge success. People love its simplicity and efficiency, and soon other architects are copying Roark's style. Roark becomes famous, and his firm grows rapidly. Soon, he is one of the most successful architects in the world.\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about",

Mikael agrees to take on the case, hoping that it will help him clear his name.\n\nAs Mikael begins his investigation, he discovers that the Vanger family is deeply divided.

He interviews members of the Vanger family and discovers that they are a dysfunctional clan with a history of violence and secrets. As he delves deeper into the investigation, he uncovers a web of lies and deceit that stretches back decades.\n\nMeanwhile, Lisbeth Salander, a computer hacker and private investigator, becomes involved in the case when she is hired by Blomkvist to help him investigate the Vangers. She quickly becomes indispensable to the investigation, using her skills as a hacker to uncover hidden information and track down leads.\n\nAs Blomkvist and Salander work together to unravel the mystery",

Forcing the enemy to rely on finite reserves is a good strategy. From our intel gathering and scouting missions we know the machines' first response will be to send two robots per every identified threat. Not a bad bit of logic on their part. The wolves were able to acquire video of some of the human assaults. We can confirm each localized machine hub will have, at minimum, 50000 robot responders. Luckily, we have some numbers. The machines decided not to bury the dead or finish off the wounded humans but to ship them away from the machine hubs. The wolf and bat armies grew after each human battle. Intel reports also bolstered our confidence that the robots would have diminished ability to fend off our armies. The machines graciously eliminated silver from any of their infrastructure, preferring either denser or more conductive metal depending on the situation. The machines also eliminated religion from their human cattle, ending the scourge of crosses or other offending accoutrements. Also, the machines removed unnecessary costs in generating food for their human cattle, including flavorings such as garlic. We've coordinated our attack with other armies across the world. Tonight's sunset heralds our initial assault, beginning in the pacific and escalating westward as the sun's influence retreats behind the horizon. We have factored in failure to our first battle. Armies will retreat north to arctic regions taking advantage of the extended nights. Getting our allies from the southern hemisphere to agree that we should retake the northern hemisphere first was hard, the logistics of getting them north of the equator to join our armies was doubly so. We've drawn up a general strategy for every localized unit to follow, leaving room for them to improvise should any unforeseen complications arise. At sunset, send 50000 foot soldiers to each hub. Once the robots stop pouring out of the hub we set off EMPs. The humans discovered this only gained them around 30 seconds of disorientation within the robots.

Forcing the enemy to rely on finite reserves is a good strategy. From our intel gathering and scouting missions we know the machines' first response will be to send two robots per every identified threat. Not a bad bit of logic on their part. The wolves were able to acquire video of some of the human assaults. We can confirm each localized machine hub will have, at minimum, 50000 robot responders. Luckily, we have some numbers. The machines decided not to bury the dead or finish off the wounded humans but to ship them away from the machine hubs. The wolf and bat armies grew after each human battle. Intel reports also bolstered our confidence that the robots would have diminished ability to fend off our armies. The machines graciously eliminated silver from any of their infrastructure, preferring either denser or more conductive metal depending on the situation. The machines also eliminated religion from their human cattle, ending the scourge of crosses or other offending accoutrements. Also, the machines removed unnecessary costs in generating food for their human cattle, including flavorings such as garlic. We've coordinated our attack with other armies across the world. Tonight's sunset heralds our initial assault, beginning in the pacific and escalating westward as the sun's influence retreats behind the horizon. We have factored in failure to our first battle. Armies will retreat north to arctic regions taking advantage of the extended nights. Getting our allies from the southern hemisphere to agree that we should retake the northern hemisphere first was hard, the logistics of getting them north of the equator to join our armies was doubly so. We've drawn up a general strategy for every localized unit to follow, leaving room for them to improvise should any unforeseen complications arise. At sunset, send 50000 foot soldiers to each hub. Once the robots stop pouring out of the hub we set off EMPs. The humans discovered this only gained them around 30 seconds of disorientation within the robots. Immediately following the EMPs we electrify the magnets we've buried in the ground. A functioning robot can not be immobilized by a magnet. A disoriented one, however will be more susceptible. After that we fight. A hopefully diminished robot army will now be fighting what they will perceive as humans an large dogs. That's where our superhuman strength, speed, agility, and healing capabilities will come into play. During the ground assault a smaller team is to sever all outside communications from each hub.

Every aspect of it did: the choosing, the execution, the guilt, all passed quicker and with less resistance than the year before. Especially the choosing. When you live for hundreds of years, you learn to spot the evil as easily as anyone else can spot a grotesque scar marring a person's face. I notice every time a child glances fearfully at her father, and I know what it means. When a man ca n't look his wife in the eye, I know what it is she's done. When a stranger holds his stare just a little too long at a passing woman, I know his plans. These clues, invisible to most, have made my job so much easier. The first time, it was hard. I was unsure, I hesitated. I remember it well, even if most others have faded into each other in my memory. The year was 1692, and I had spent the first eleven months following around a man who had killed and tortured people to further himself, and he showed no remorse for it. But I was young, just twenty-five, and I still clung to my morals of \"only god may judge.\". I watched him sleep for just a minute too long and I lost my nerve. As I turned around to leave, something hard caught me on the back of the head, and the dim candle light faded away, my thoughts disappearing with it. I woke with a start and tried to draw a breath, but my lungs were met with an ice cold burn that gave me no air. Everything around me felt heavy, and I struggled to open my eyes.

Every aspect of it did: the choosing, the execution, the guilt, all passed quicker and with less resistance than the year before. Especially the choosing. When you live for hundreds of years, you learn to spot the evil as easily as anyone else can spot a grotesque scar marring a person's face. I notice every time a child glances fearfully at her father, and I know what it means. When a man ca n't look his wife in the eye, I know what it is she's done. When a stranger holds his stare just a little too long at a passing woman, I know his plans. These clues, invisible to most, have made my job so much easier. The first time, it was hard. I was unsure, I hesitated. I remember it well, even if most others have faded into each other in my memory. The year was 1692, and I had spent the first eleven months following around a man who had killed and tortured people to further himself, and he showed no remorse for it. But I was young, just twenty-five, and I still clung to my morals of \"only god may judge.\". I watched him sleep for just a minute too long and I lost my nerve. As I turned around to leave, something hard caught me on the back of the head, and the dim candle light faded away, my thoughts disappearing with it. I woke with a start and tried to draw a breath, but my lungs were met with an ice cold burn that gave me no air. Everything around me felt heavy, and I struggled to open my eyes. With terror, I realized I was under water. I may have been immortal, but I was not immune to the pain of drowning. I tried to reach out, to swim away, but a cloth surrounded me. I struggled to pull out my knife, trying not to gasp in any more water to feed the fire engulfing my lungs.

It'd been weeks since I last had a chance to talk to another human, instead of just the PC terminal supplied by work. I towelled off and staggered through to the living-room and slumped in front of the computer, waiting for the piercing whistle to repeat, to emanate from my phone.

English, ethics, road safety, compassion testing, aesthetics, philosophical contemplation, the sciences. It was a hard sell at the beginning, for companies to give their employees the few hours off each morning they needed for the state-mandated testing, but given the choice between late employees and those in conscious comas, they made the right choice. Two hours later, the general test finishes. I flick through my results, 91 % recognition of the basic concepts, not too bad after a night of hard drinking.

No, definitely not. I shout and swear and blaspheme out loud, as I slowly feel the neurovirus go to work; Purgatory, we call it, a limbo without knowledge, tied with a purging. It dissolves me gently. The panic subsides. I stare blankly at the flashing cursor, waiting for me to enter some detail or another.

Living in post-war Britain, death was not an uncommon sight. Everyone had at least one firearm to defend themselves, everyone had encountered gunfire in the streets, and everyone knew what it meant to live every day like it could be their last. The revolution that was supposed to end the tyranny of a dictatorship had ripped the country apart; counties had split into factions, all threatening total destruction of the others. In ten years the population was decimated, the country reduced to a crumbling mass of fallen buildings and civilians with guns. All around me was depression, death, dirt, famine. Thinking about it, it's quite hilarious, in such a depressing way. The sacks of bones, flesh and organs we saw everyday were once living, breathing, talking human beings. They had a mother, a father, a pet, a first love, they were educated, they succeeded and they failed. And they died. A single bullet can end so much. That morning, as I wandered to the local shop for some bread, clutching my rifle, my world completely ended. I had no time to react; as soon as I entered Grange Avenue a bullet burrowed into my head, smashing part of my brain, and knocking me straight out cold. I woke in a beautiful wooden chalet, bright natural light streaming through vast windows above the soft, clean bed that I rested in. My itchy, dirty clothes were replaced with beautiful white robes, soft as silk and cleaner than anything I had ever seen.

Living in post-war Britain, death was not an uncommon sight. Everyone had at least one firearm to defend themselves, everyone had encountered gunfire in the streets, and everyone knew what it meant to live every day like it could be their last. The revolution that was supposed to end the tyranny of a dictatorship had ripped the country apart; counties had split into factions, all threatening total destruction of the others. In ten years the population was decimated, the country reduced to a crumbling mass of fallen buildings and civilians with guns. All around me was depression, death, dirt, famine. Thinking about it, it's quite hilarious, in such a depressing way. The sacks of bones, flesh and organs we saw everyday were once living, breathing, talking human beings. They had a mother, a father, a pet, a first love, they were educated, they succeeded and they failed. And they died. A single bullet can end so much. That morning, as I wandered to the local shop for some bread, clutching my rifle, my world completely ended. I had no time to react; as soon as I entered Grange Avenue a bullet burrowed into my head, smashing part of my brain, and knocking me straight out cold. I woke in a beautiful wooden chalet, bright natural light streaming through vast windows above the soft, clean bed that I rested in. My itchy, dirty clothes were replaced with beautiful white robes, soft as silk and cleaner than anything I had ever seen. I sat up, and looked around the room - it was furnished luxuriously, with beautiful gold-leaf chairs and fantastic bright works of art hanging around the room. I got up and left the room, and immediately my breath was forced from me. The crumbled grey streets of London had gone.

At one point, they stop at a farm owned by a man named Jim Cullen. He is a former member of the Communist Party, and he has been trying to organize the workers on his farm. However, he is having trouble getting them to join him because they are afraid of being arrested by the police. One night, while the family is sleeping, someone breaks into their house and steals their food. When they wake up, they find that their food has been stolen. They decide to go back to the farm and confront Jim Cullen about what happened. When they get there, they find that he has been killed by the police.

One day, Juliet receives a package from Dawsey containing a book called \"The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society\". This book tells the story of how a group of people on Guernsey Island started a literary society during World War II. The members of the society would meet in secret to read books and talk about literature. They also ate potato peel pie, which was made out of leftover potatoes. The society became popular on Guernsey Island, and it helped the islanders cope with the war. Juliet is fascinated by the story of the Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society, and she decides to write a novel about it. She researches the history of Guernsey Island and interviews people who were alive during World War II. She also visits Guernsey Island",

I was on my way to an important business meeting, off to discuss some law, and how my company could avoid it, when it all happened. I checked my watch to see the time, and as I looked up, I saw a blinding flash off in the distance, lighting up the once blue sky in streaks of white. Next, it was followed by an eardrum shattering bang, like a hundred thousand gunshots going off at once. Then, finally, the blast.

        "output": " This is a real society, founded during World War II. During the German occupation of the Channel Islands, the British government forbade islanders from growing potatoes. As a result, many people starved. To avoid detection, the islanders formed a literary society, which met regularly to discuss books. The group also served food, including potato peel pie. The society became so popular that it continued to meet long after the war ended. Dawsey's letter to Juliet suggests that the society may have been more than just a social club. He writes: \"The society has become a bit of a legend now, and there are some who say that it was not really a literary society at all, but a cover for something else.\" What might this \"something else\" have been?",

I knew that the city outside the Archive and the Archive itself were situational representations. I knew that the year was 12 and that no evidence of organic intelligence had ever been discovered. There was nothing on Earth remotely resembling human beings. I was just the system representing some part of itself to itself in the most efficient way it knew how.

They come across a group of dwarves who are looking for a home. Gandalf explains that he knows where they can find one. They continue their journey and eventually reach the Lonely Mountain. The dwarves are excited to see their homeland again after so long. They enter the mountain and find a treasure trove of gold and jewels. Gandalf tells them that they must share the wealth with everyone else in the kingdom. The dwarves agree and start dividing up the treasure. Bilbo takes a small bag of gold coins for himself. He puts them in his pocket and continues on his way. The next morning, Bilbo wakes up feeling sick. He goes to the bathroom and vomits up all the gold coins.

Forcing the enemy to rely on finite reserves is a good strategy. From our intel gathering and scouting missions we know the machines' first response will be to send two robots per every identified threat. Not a bad bit of logic on their part. The wolves were able to acquire video of some of the human assaults. We can confirm each localized machine hub will have, at minimum, 50000 robot responders. Luckily, we have some numbers. The machines decided not to bury the dead or finish off the wounded humans but to ship them away from the machine hubs. The wolf and bat armies grew after each human battle. Intel reports also bolstered our confidence that the robots would have diminished ability to fend off our armies. The machines graciously eliminated silver from any of their infrastructure, preferring either denser or more conductive metal depending on the situation. The machines also eliminated religion from their human cattle, ending the scourge of crosses or other offending accoutrements. Also, the machines removed unnecessary costs in generating food for their human cattle, including flavorings such as garlic. We've coordinated our attack with other armies across the world. Tonight's sunset heralds our initial assault, beginning in the pacific and escalating westward as the sun's influence retreats behind the horizon. We have factored in failure to our first battle. Armies will retreat north to arctic regions taking advantage of the extended nights. Getting our allies from the southern hemisphere to agree that we should retake the northern hemisphere first was hard, the logistics of getting them north of the equator to join our armies was doubly so. We've drawn up a general strategy for every localized unit to follow, leaving room for them to improvise should any unforeseen complications arise. At sunset, send 50000 foot soldiers to each hub. Once the robots stop pouring out of the hub we set off EMPs. The humans discovered this only gained them around 30 seconds of disorientation within the robots. Immediately following the EMPs we electrify the magnets we've buried in the ground. A functioning robot can not be immobilized by a magnet. A disoriented one, however will be more susceptible. After that we fight. A hopefully diminished robot army will now be fighting what they will perceive as humans an large dogs. That's where our superhuman strength, speed, agility, and healing capabilities will come into play. During the ground assault a smaller team is to sever all outside communications from each hub. Disrupted communications should at least slow down global coordination with other hubs. We wanted to take out their communications before each assault, however the machines' penchant for redundancy and underground infrastructure proved cumbersome. It was decided to utilize the distraction of our infantry attacks as the opportunity to get around access issues. Watching the seconds tick by waiting for our signal to move should be nothing compared to the centuries I've been hiding underground waiting to resurface. Sadly this is not the case. I'm comforted by thoughts of global supremacy should we succeed. I'm not looking forward to the inevitable Werewolf/Vampire war that will take place after our victory over the machines. We'll have to deal with that problem when it comes, I suppose. For right now it's time to transform into a wolf.

The road to salvation is a treacherous one, and the advice I give you may run counter to the actions of your peers, but do not fret. Firstly it is important that the patient become involved within his church, let him see that even the most faithful doubt, even the most chaste are tempted, and even the holiest among them sin. You must weed ideas within him that this is acceptable. Remind him that he is naught but a flawed human and without the grace of god he is doomed to perish. Secondly is his works. Encourage the patient at all turns to minister. Let him minister to the poor, to remind him that all of the enemy's children still want. Let him minister to the sick to remind him that the enemy's children still despair. Let him do all these things selflessly, a shining paragon of virtue, so others may look upon him and marvel at his deeds. When he is asked why he performs these things what shall he tell them? \"It is God's will\"? No, I say. He should reply that he does them from the love within his own heart, and should he be pressed only then will he reveal that it is God's love that shines through him. Let him lead by example, dear Wormwood, and not by decree or doctrine, for humans are foolish and prefer the words of a hypocrite over the actions of a saint. I tell you that the patient should not pass judgement, or if he must, he should not condemn, but offer forgiveness. For this way the patient will be led most astray, by showing grace instead of wrath those around him will be free to sin again, but also take care that the patient not be weak to those who sin against him. Model the patients behavior to mimic the enemy, justice tempered with mercy, so sins of actions are stopped and sins of the heart may heal. Should the patient face danger give him courage, should the patient face adversity give him perseverance, and above all never let him forget the love of the enemy, so that upon his road to damnation he is given some measure of comfort.

Looking back, she cursed at herself for not noticing the dark object lying in front of where she once slept. However, it wasn' t entirely her fault. The narcotics that kept her stable for the past century were now hampering her vision and critical thinking. & nbsp; \"Welcome back Captain Munderline.\" & nbsp; Confused, the captain spun around searching for the source of the voice. & nbsp; \"It has been a while. You should sit down and rest. The drugs need some time to wear off.\" The voice appeared to be coming from her chamber. It sounded like a charming woman with a British accent. & nbsp; Captain Munderline did not need much convincing from the lady. She sat down and began to take in her surroundings. She was in a long dimly lit corridor with chambers similar to hers across from each other on both sides of the hall. The faces barely visible in each chamber exposed the many eyes peering at each other from across the hall in a prolonged stare. Directly in front of her chamber where she had been tripped was not one object as she previously had thought. To the contrary, it was a collection of cans in what appeared to be some sort of Mayan circle formation. Curious, she made her way over and reached to pick one up. & nbsp; The British voice startled her before she could grab one of the cans. \"Captain Munderline. Your task is to prep the shuttle for arrival to Gia II. You have 24 hours before the entirety of the crew awakes. Remember your training and good luck.\" & nbsp; This message brought the Captain to her senses. She still was feeling the side effects of the narcotics but she was sober enough to operate what was supposed to be a set of procedural maintenance checks. She stood up and made her way to the exit of the corridor while the training from her distant past flooded her thoughts. & nbsp; When the lock opened to the next room the first shock to her was probably the wretched smell. It was nauseating. The source lay in front fifty feet in front of her. A passenger was sleeping with his arms wrapped tightly around of a rotted corpse. Surrounding this morbid scene was an arrangement of trash in a design similar to that in front of her sleeping chamber. & nbsp; Captain Munderline screamed, awaking the passenger. He looked up at her with bloodshot eyes. Half of his face was disfigured and infected with fungus. He spoke gibberish at her but did not stand up. It was quite possible that he was incapable of doing so. It appeared that he was near the end of his life. & nbsp; The Captain quickly realized what needed to be done. This passenger was a danger to the morale of the entire crew and she had less than 24 hours to clean this disaster. She grabbed a metal bar that was laying on the ground and walked towards the passenger and his skeleton friend.\n\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about 500 words in length:\nKatniss and Peeta are styled as the 'star-crossed lovers from District 12'."

It sounded like a charming woman with a British accent. & nbsp; Captain Munderline did not need much convincing from the lady. She sat down and began to take in her surroundings. She was in a long dimly lit corridor with chambers similar to hers across from each other on both sides of the hall. The faces barely visible in each chamber exposed the many eyes peering at each other from across the hall in a prolonged stare. Directly in front of her chamber where she had been tripped was not one object as she previously had thought. To the contrary, it was a collection of cans in what appeared to be some sort of Mayan circle formation. Curious, she made her way over and reached to pick one up. & nbsp; The British voice startled her before she could grab one of the cans. \"Captain Munderline. Your task is to prep the shuttle for arrival to Gia II. You have 24 hours before the entirety of the crew awakes. Remember your training and good luck.\" & nbsp; This message brought the Captain to her senses. She still was feeling the side effects of the narcotics but she was sober enough to operate what was supposed to be a set of procedural maintenance checks. She stood up and made her way to the exit of the corridor while the training from her distant past flooded her thoughts. & nbsp; When the lock opened to the next room the first shock to her was probably the wretched smell. It was nauseating. The source lay in front fifty feet in front of her. A passenger was sleeping with his arms wrapped tightly around of a rotted corpse. Surrounding this morbid scene was an arrangement of trash in a design similar to that in front of her sleeping chamber. & nbsp; Captain Munderline screamed, awaking the passenger. He looked up at her with bloodshot eyes. Half of his face was disfigured and infected with fungus. He spoke gibberish at her but did not stand up. It was quite possible that he was incapable of doing so. It appeared that he was near the end of his life. & nbsp; The Captain quickly realized what needed to be done. This passenger was a danger to the morale of the entire crew and she had less than 24 hours to clean this disaster. She grabbed a metal bar that was laying on the ground and walked towards the passenger and his skeleton friend.\n\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about 500 words in length:\nKatniss and Peeta are styled as the 'star-crossed lovers from District 12'.",

She is a strong-willed girl who lives in the fictional country of Panem. Her father died when she was young, leaving her mother and younger sister Primrose to fend for themselves. Katniss takes care of them by hunting and gathering food for their family. One day, she volunteers to take Prim's place in the annual Hunger Games, a deadly competition where two teenagers from each district must fight to the death until there is only one survivor left. Peeta Mellark is a baker's son from District 12. He is kind-hearted and compassionate, always looking out for others. He develops feelings for Katniss during the games, even though they are rivals.

The dawn of a new day, when humans thought to sneak up on the Deep Woods Dragon while it slept. It feared the way the sun reflected off of it' s scales, they said. It' s prismatic hide was so bright it was blinding. If taunted into the sun, they said, the Deep Woods Dragon could be defeated by the least trained of knights. The Deep Woods Dragon needed to be blinded, they said, or it would burn its attackers to ashes with rainbow-hued flames. He knew these rumors because the butterflies had told him. They were drawn to the rainbow of greens, yellows, pinks and purples of his scales, like the flowers they coveted so much. They had told him this, too, but the Dragon did not mind. The butterflies were honest, as their lives were short and beautiful. Even still, they could fly unhindered among the humans, even admired by the small humans who chased them, laughing. They told him stories while they rested on his wingtips, tail, and snout. Butterflies did not fear the Dragon, because they knew the truth. With a yawn, the Dragon shifted its weight to better perch itself on the tree' s stout branch. This tree was taller than the others, and overlooked a small, circular clearing. Without the deer, the weeds thrived, covering the dirt in a green, tangled mass. At the edge of the clearing stood a massive cave entrance, vines draped over the sides of smooth rock. The Dragon had snapped off the vines in front of the entrance, to give the illusion of occupancy. This was, after all, where the humans thought he lived. He knew these rumors because the butterflies had told him. \"In an ancient cave in the middle of the wood, lives an ancient dragon who' s up to no good!\" That was what the small humans like to chant as they chased the butterflies and laughed. So the Dragon tore at the vines, and scared the graceful deer from the peaceful clearing. He had enjoyed watching the deer with their young as they grazed the clearing. From up above in his favorite tree, they could not see him, and they could not fear him. Three times a day, the Dragon glided down from his tree to the old cave' s opening. There, he took a deep breath and screamed as loud as he could. He cried in both low tones and high pitches. He wailed in imitation of female humans, shouted in a voice mimicking angry male humans. The Dragon stood on top of the cave and breathed eye-searing beams of light from his mouth to the sky. It scared the birds huddled in the trees, and the noises scared the deer far from the clearing. But they also scared the humans away from the Deep Woods. He knew these rumors because the butterflies had told him. So he made his noises, made the lights, and scared the humans away. Because any humans who saw the Dragon would discover the truth. Because, when the Dragon stepped into the sunlight, they' d see how small he really was.

They decide to rob the Clutters because they have heard that there is $10,000 in cash hidden somewhere in the house. They know that Herb Clutter is a wealthy farmer and businessman. They also know that Herb has been having financial problems lately. They think that he might be hiding some money in the house to avoid paying taxes. They decide to rob the Clutters because they need the money to buy drugs and alcohol. They also want to get revenge on Herb for something he did to them in the past. They plan to kill the entire Clutter family during the robbery. They think that this will make it easier to find the money. They also think that killing the Clutters will send a message to other rich people who don't pay their taxes. On November 15th, 1959, Dick and Perry break into the Clutter home. They tie up Herb",

The town of Holcomb, Kansas, is a quiet place where people are friendly and neighbors help each other. However, when the Clutters are murdered, the community is shocked and saddened. The police investigate the crime scene and discover that the killers left behind a note saying they wanted money. They also found evidence that the murderers had been watching the Clutters for weeks before they killed them. The investigation leads to two suspects: Richard Hickock and Perry Smith. Both men have criminal records and were known to be involved in drug trafficking. The police arrest both men and charge them with first-degree murder. During their trial, witnesses testify that Hickock and Smith were seen near the Clutter home shortly before the murders occurred. Additionally, forensic evidence links both men to the crime scene. Despite their claims of innocence, Hickock and Smith are convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to death by hanging. Their execution takes",

The office towers lighting up in the evening haze and the smeary pale of a cloudless sunset. The tiny headlights of cars with sweaty passengers unseen, idling in traffic, smelling the hot food cooking in restaurants. The world shifts as the woman behind the camera adjusts her footing, muttering in English to her boyfriend. A light like the sun over the horizon, there and then gone. Silence, but for the wind in the trees. She asks what that was. The clean, shaved, washed, waxed people in suits at desks read facts and information like sports commentary.

The office towers lighting up in the evening haze and the smeary pale of a cloudless sunset. The tiny headlights of cars with sweaty passengers unseen, idling in traffic, smelling the hot food cooking in restaurants. The world shifts as the woman behind the camera adjusts her footing, muttering in English to her boyfriend. A light like the sun over the horizon, there and then gone. Silence, but for the wind in the trees. She asks what that was. The clean, shaved, washed, waxed people in suits at desks read facts and information like sports commentary.

Lacey gives them access to all the evidence in the case. Capote and Lee spend months interviewing everyone involved in the case, including the killers themselves. They also visit the crime scene and talk to witnesses. As they gather more information, Capote begins to develop a theory about what happened. He believes that the murders were not random acts of violence, but rather part of a larger conspiracy. With this new understanding, Capote sets out to write a novel that will tell the true story of the murders. The result is In Cold Blood, one of the most famous nonfiction novels ever written. It is a gripping account of two men who committed a senseless act of violence and the impact it had on their victims' families. But it is also much more than that.

Lee orders Longstreet to attack immediately. Longstreet protests, saying that the Union forces are too strong and that they should wait until reinforcements arrive. But Lee insists, and the battle begins. The Confederate troops charge forward, but they are met with fierce resistance from the Union soldiers. The fighting rages on for hours, with neither side gaining an advantage. Finally, the Confederates break through the Union lines and push them back towards town. But then, disaster strikes. A group of Union cavalrymen led by General Custer appears on the battlefield. They charge into the Confederate ranks, cutting down men left and right. The Confederate troops are thrown into confusion, and many of them flee the field. In the end, the Battle of Gettysburg is a crushing defeat for the Confederacy. It is a turning point in the Civil",

I propelled myself towards the window, clear through the slit. The other toys were already at the edge of the law waiting for me, but I had to look back at least once.

It was in clinical trials and was being fast-tracked. Six months, only six months left. I drove like a madman to the hospital. Transferred? What do you mean transferred? I PAID THE BILLS FOR 9 MONTHS BEFORE I LEFT!!! 15 months ago... Oh god. Over a year. I found her. I barely recognized her, except her voice. That angelic voice that kept me going. It was difficult explaining where I'd been. I was gone for so long. She did n't understand, she was just happy to see me. Then the doctor came in. He pulled me aside. No. NO! 1 month, at best. NO! NO! NO! NO! I started to run out of the room, but she could tell. She did n't know what I was doing, but she knew I would n't be back. She pleaded, and it tore my heart apart, but I was doing it for her. When I was done, we could spend the rest of our lives together. I left, I jumped, I landed. I ran to the pharmacy, prescription in hand. The doctor had been confused when I asked for it. Probably thought it was a reaction to his prognosis. A line. There was a line at the pharmacy. It took everything I had not to scream. But then I remembered, I had all the time in the world. Drug in hand, I dialed in the date of her diagnosis. I entered the code and pressed enter. ERROR: Abort, Retry, Fail? What happened next rendered the machine useless... Now! I had to get to her now! I had to cure her right now. I stole a car, I do n't know whose it was, I could n't even tell you what kind or color it was. At some point the police started chasing me. I outran them. At the entrance, security tried to stop me, I outran them. When they told me, my guilt and denial rushed to me at once, I could n't outrun it. I just wanted to spend the rest of my life with her, so I left.

I PAID THE BILLS FOR 9 MONTHS BEFORE I LEFT!!! 15 months ago... Oh god. Over a year. I found her. I barely recognized her, except her voice. That angelic voice that kept me going. It was difficult explaining where I'd been. I was gone for so long. She did n't understand, she was just happy to see me. Then the doctor came in. He pulled me aside. No. NO! 1 month, at best. NO! NO! NO! NO! I started to run out of the room, but she could tell. She did n't know what I was doing, but she knew I would n't be back. She pleaded, and it tore my heart apart, but I was doing it for her. When I was done, we could spend the rest of our lives together. I left, I jumped, I landed. I ran to the pharmacy, prescription in hand. The doctor had been confused when I asked for it. Probably thought it was a reaction to his prognosis. A line. There was a line at the pharmacy. It took everything I had not to scream. But then I remembered, I had all the time in the world. Drug in hand, I dialed in the date of her diagnosis. I entered the code and pressed enter. ERROR: Abort, Retry, Fail? What happened next rendered the machine useless... Now! I had to get to her now! I had to cure her right now. I stole a car, I do n't know whose it was, I could n't even tell you what kind or color it was. At some point the police started chasing me. I outran them. At the entrance, security tried to stop me, I outran them. When they told me, my guilt and denial rushed to me at once, I could n't outrun it. I just wanted to spend the rest of my life with her, so I left. She just wanted to spend the rest of her life with me, so she asked me to stay.\n\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about 500 words in length:\nAmir plants a watch under Hassan's mattress to frame him.",

He always thought of others first, always trying to help others before even contemplating his own commodities. I approached him on the fateful day at exactly noon. He was old now, no longer in his prime as he was finally about to lose his battle with cancer. I approached him as the hourglass emptied completely to the bottom.

How dreadful to go when so many more need help!\" At this moment I found it immensely hard to fulfill my task. I was not met with a man begging for more time only to waste it on fruitless trivialities. I was met with a man who wanted to bring grace to more people. He wished not to make his life better, but only cares to try to improve as many others as possible. I finally brought myself to say,\" David you have been a good man, but death is one thing which is inevitable, and not even I can grant time when someone is due. You must come along now with me.\" He allowed his soul to leave his body, a tear running down his face as he did. I extended my arm to him and he obliged.

I saw, as we walked, countless people who David had helped, most of which he had n't known and would never see again.

I never had such a hard time seeing someone move on, and I sat a while thinking of how tragic it is for someone like David, genuinely the best kind of person, to be taken from such a cruel world when he one of the few people who deserved to stay.

I saw my friends, family, strangers, all given the most precious thing in life. Lucy, my sweet dear sister, was able to fly to the heavens and back. Richard, my childhood best friend, saved hundreds of lives throughout his life, having the strength of ten men. And there I waited, for years, until my life could start, and I would transform into the real me... the powerful me. Yet, with each passing day, more people would discover their power, and I would sit waiting at night, forcing myself to sleep. My dreams were filled with possibilities, of flight and strength, and of mind and hope. But as the years passed, my dreams were less vivid. Not everyone is lucky enough to have their inner power. Some die before that beautiful gift is bestowed unto them. I thought that may happen to me. And I lived life for a while, depressed and alone. That was until I met her. Her name was Alison. She had a power, but chose not use it. She did not want to be defined by her single ability. We met during one of my travels, when I was touring the country trying to find meaning in life. I found it. I found her. From that point on, my life started. I did not care about being granted a special ability as much as I cared for her. I saw my future, a family, a wife, children. We created a beautiful life together. Alison passed away a few years ago. I had only asked her once what her power was, and she had told me it did not matter. As she was lying on her bed, slowly fading away, she told me what her inner power was. She said she was born with her power, that she had the ability to live forever, as long as she did not love. \"My power was a curse, until I found you\", she told me before she passed. Today is my 70th birthday. Today I have discovered what my power is. Old age has not been kind on me, and this is the most beautiful power I could have hoped for. When I remember my wife, the times we spent, they are not just memories any longer. I can feel the brisk of the air on the hill where we first met. I can smell the flowers. I can here her giggle, her breath against my cheek.

I'll try to guess what you're seeing. A stunning blue sphere, with splotches of green and white covering its surface. A dot contrasted against the vast dark expanse of space. Twisting and turning around the sun, the moon its closest companion, shining brightly by the planet's side. Truly a sight to behold. But I wanted to see it for myself. I sent up a rocket to orbit the Earth, its only purpose to take photos of this beautiful planet. And as I thought they would be, the pictures were marvelous, a true reflection of the beauty of nature. Yet instead of awe, my mouth was open in shock. The image you have in your head is wrong. I saw the oceans, blue as ever and the continents floating on top. I saw the clouds, seemingly painted onto the surface. And if I squinted, I saw the mountain ranges, the seas, the islands, all humanity's residence. And yet, something was wrong. I did n't see the round sphere I expected to see. Instead I saw a planet, so familiar, yet so distant. I saw a flat Earth. I stared at the photos with a blank look on my face. How could this be real? The shape of the Earth is a scientific fact that we've known for centuries, and yet I held in my hands the evidence that changes all that. Have we been wrong this whole time? I sat down and tried to comprehend it all. I was in denial. I checked to see if somehow, there was something wrong with the picture, perhaps the computer had gotten the data wrong, perhaps it was sending faulty messages, perhaps someone was just messing with me. I held on to the tiny sliver of hope that I was wrong, that this was all just a big misunderstanding. But alas, I was right. Though the possibility that perhaps something was wrong lingered in the back of my mind, I knew that it was true. I stared up at the night sky, looking at the stars. Humans are very stubborn creatures. We refuse to believe we are ever wrong and when we do, we admit it with a sigh of disappointment instead of a smile, knowing that we've learned something new. We take it as a personal insult to our intelligence if we're wrong, thinking'we should've known.\" Thinking we're right is more important than being right. But I am a logical, rational human being. I ca n't let my emotions overcome me. Knowing the truth is infinitely more important than being right. And yet I find myself so hesitant to admit the mistakes of my predecessors. To admit that we will have to re-learn everything about the Earth. To admit that we will have to start again. To admit that humans are mere mortals. The thing about facts is that they're true whether you believe in them or not. But I can change that. I grabbed my lighter and lit the photos. I watched them burn up until they had turned into ash. And I went to sleep, happy.\n\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about 500 words in length:\nJoe Christmas's past, including his time at an orphanage and with the McEacherns, is revealed."

I'll try to guess what you're seeing. A stunning blue sphere, with splotches of green and white covering its surface. A dot contrasted against the vast dark expanse of space. Twisting and turning around the sun, the moon its closest companion, shining brightly by the planet's side. Truly a sight to behold. But I wanted to see it for myself. I sent up a rocket to orbit the Earth, its only purpose to take photos of this beautiful planet. And as I thought they would be, the pictures were marvelous, a true reflection of the beauty of nature. Yet instead of awe, my mouth was open in shock. The image you have in your head is wrong. I saw the oceans, blue as ever and the continents floating on top. I saw the clouds, seemingly painted onto the surface. And if I squinted, I saw the mountain ranges, the seas, the islands, all humanity's residence. And yet, something was wrong. I did n't see the round sphere I expected to see. Instead I saw a planet, so familiar, yet so distant. I saw a flat Earth. I stared at the photos with a blank look on my face. How could this be real? The shape of the Earth is a scientific fact that we've known for centuries, and yet I held in my hands the evidence that changes all that. Have we been wrong this whole time? I sat down and tried to comprehend it all. I was in denial. I checked to see if somehow, there was something wrong with the picture, perhaps the computer had gotten the data wrong, perhaps it was sending faulty messages, perhaps someone was just messing with me. I held on to the tiny sliver of hope that I was wrong, that this was all just a big misunderstanding. But alas, I was right. Though the possibility that perhaps something was wrong lingered in the back of my mind, I knew that it was true. I stared up at the night sky, looking at the stars. Humans are very stubborn creatures. We refuse to believe we are ever wrong and when we do, we admit it with a sigh of disappointment instead of a smile, knowing that we've learned something new. We take it as a personal insult to our intelligence if we're wrong, thinking'we should've known.\" Thinking we're right is more important than being right. But I am a logical, rational human being. I ca n't let my emotions overcome me. Knowing the truth is infinitely more important than being right. And yet I find myself so hesitant to admit the mistakes of my predecessors. To admit that we will have to re-learn everything about the Earth. To admit that we will have to start again. To admit that humans are mere mortals. The thing about facts is that they're true whether you believe in them or not. But I can change that. I grabbed my lighter and lit the photos. I watched them burn up until they had turned into ash. And I went to sleep, happy.\n\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about 500 words in length:\nJoe Christmas's past, including his time at an orphanage and with the McEacherns, is revealed.",

The toys did n't need a second prompt. The strong man and Mr. Potato head grabbed the monkeys in a barrel, hopped in RC and gunned the engines. The army men attempted to rescue some of the less mobile toys, but it was too late. One brilliant child had the idea to grab my waist with his sweaty, greasy hand and hold me up in the air. I put up a fight, hoping to distract them enough to let everyone escape. I did n't know what would happen, but panic had overrun my emotions and pure terror coursed through my plastic veins.

How can something fictional seem so vivid...? The distant, exotic land we came from, its gilded avenues, its glistening intricate spires, its profound natural beauty with lushly verdant banks hugging the rivers that snaked between the dunes. .. None of it was there. It was all nothing more than a dream. But I am not a lie. I stare at my hands, flexing them, examining the callouses accumulated by work never done, cracks formed of age never lived, and despite the warmth of the bright sun just passing its zenith above, I shiver. \"Amir,\" I hear a voice call, and my heart tugs at what I know to be familiarity. \"Hassan...?\" I uncertainly reply as I look up. Our gazes meet. I could swear I saw in his eyes the same false memories flashing behind mine. Childhood among parents who never lived, in a community that was never built, attending an academy that was never founded, graduating from a ceremony never held... He nods hollowly, as if to confirm these very musings. \"... We have to pack the supplies, Amir. His Majesty will be staying at the palace, and the staff are directing us to where we are to stow his wardrobe and leave his tributes to The Sultan.\" My mouth was dry, but not in response to his words. At some point I realized my'old friend' Hassan was talking only to fill the screaming void in our minds. To'Sound Normal', like'Real People'. My stomach is a knot of ice. Still, the skills of a life as-yet unlived surface readily to the forefront of my mind. How to port the many caskets of His Majesty Prince Ali's wares. \"... Yes. I will coordinate with the provisioner. If my memory serves,\" I pause a bit too long, lost in the jarring disjunction of citing false memories, \"... it is customary to serve a great feast with the arrival of a dignitary. The many delicacies of our homeland are sure to leave a resounding impression upon The Sultan's court.\" Hassan's expression tightens. I feel his heartache, for this homeland which we have never seen with real eyes, and never shall. He hesitantly takes a step nearer and dispenses a conciliatory pat to my shoulder. A mutual understanding. We were truly all feeling it, every last member of His Majesty Prince Ali's vanguard.... he was n't even really a prince. I shudder and turn, to address the court provisioner by name. He's just as haunted and startled as I that we know one another, but everything is running smoothly. We have no solace from our inner thoughts. We can only push on in the hopes that the minutia will wash away the horror.\n\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about 500 words in length:\nKatniss sees the ruins of District 12."

How can something fictional seem so vivid...? The distant, exotic land we came from, its gilded avenues, its glistening intricate spires, its profound natural beauty with lushly verdant banks hugging the rivers that snaked between the dunes. .. None of it was there. It was all nothing more than a dream. But I am not a lie. I stare at my hands, flexing them, examining the callouses accumulated by work never done, cracks formed of age never lived, and despite the warmth of the bright sun just passing its zenith above, I shiver. \"Amir,\" I hear a voice call, and my heart tugs at what I know to be familiarity. \"Hassan...?\" I uncertainly reply as I look up. Our gazes meet. I could swear I saw in his eyes the same false memories flashing behind mine. Childhood among parents who never lived, in a community that was never built, attending an academy that was never founded, graduating from a ceremony never held... He nods hollowly, as if to confirm these very musings. \"... We have to pack the supplies, Amir. His Majesty will be staying at the palace, and the staff are directing us to where we are to stow his wardrobe and leave his tributes to The Sultan.\" My mouth was dry, but not in response to his words. At some point I realized my'old friend' Hassan was talking only to fill the screaming void in our minds. To'Sound Normal', like'Real People'. My stomach is a knot of ice. Still, the skills of a life as-yet unlived surface readily to the forefront of my mind. How to port the many caskets of His Majesty Prince Ali's wares. \"... Yes. I will coordinate with the provisioner. If my memory serves,\" I pause a bit too long, lost in the jarring disjunction of citing false memories, \"... it is customary to serve a great feast with the arrival of a dignitary. The many delicacies of our homeland are sure to leave a resounding impression upon The Sultan's court.\" Hassan's expression tightens. I feel his heartache, for this homeland which we have never seen with real eyes, and never shall. He hesitantly takes a step nearer and dispenses a conciliatory pat to my shoulder. A mutual understanding. We were truly all feeling it, every last member of His Majesty Prince Ali's vanguard.... he was n't even really a prince. I shudder and turn, to address the court provisioner by name. He's just as haunted and startled as I that we know one another, but everything is running smoothly. We have no solace from our inner thoughts. We can only push on in the hopes that the minutia will wash away the horror.\n\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about 500 words in length:\nKatniss sees the ruins of District 12.",

Contemplating my life as it were. So many memories I wanted to share with you. Diamonds for my one true love. Do you remember that one cool summer evening half a lifetime ago? We nestled ourselves against each other on the blanket in the park. I can still feel your skin against mine as we watched the fireworks together. Your chestnut hair stroking my cheek and ear as you rested your head on my shoulder. I could n't believe you were gone. Day turned into night. Food tasted like nothing. The world turned into a bland grey color. I could n't believe it. I did n't want to believe it. I wept and kept weeping. Then I had no tears left to sob. I lost weight. I lost my hair. I gained wrinkles. When I lost you, the man in the mirror showed me his true age almost overnight. But then things started to change. Our Elisabeth. Our loving, kind Lillibeth who moved half a world for her Australian. She visited me eventually. We talked about you, Lily. We shared a thousand little things between us. A flock of starlings composing your life. During that visit, the turmoil caused by losing you finally seemed to settle. At the end, I decided to finally change my Facebook status. Lillibeth helped me. You know my old, bony fingers have gotten a mind of their own, it seems. I wanted to tell you, Lilly, that I got a little surprise the very next day. This tabby kitten sat outside our garden door the very next morning. It seemed lost, but her eyes betrayed she knew exactly were she was. As I opened the door, she jumped right in and installed herself in the spot on the couch from where you used to watch the telly during long winter evenings. I decided to dub her Lilly because she seems to have a playful streak. Just like you. And most importantly, she seemed to be the antidote to my loneliness. That's not the end of it. Lily was only the first. Each week, I woke up to find two or three feline friends at our garden door. I let them, fed them and started to call them by a name I gave them. Each of them seemingly knowing that she belonged in this house. There's Athena who sits on your sewing machine, looking wise beyond her years. There's Hera who likes to wake me up each morning, and has this stern and down-to-earth disposition. There's Hebe, she's just a kitten who seems to have no bounds teasing the others. All in all, there's twelve of them who came to live with me. They keep me company. Follow me through the house as I go about my day. When I see them, they always remind me of a part of you. An aspect that I should n't forget. Sometimes they're mere presence helps me as the practicalities in life start to fade from my memory. When I spot Demeter sitting in front of the fridge, it hits me that I still need to do the groceries. Oh Lily, I miss you so much. My life has entered the twilight years. Only so much time is left before I will join you. I hope our Lillibeth will take care of my twelve feline companions. She'll be most delighted recognising some aspect of her mother in each of them.

I take a quick scan of the train, watching the stream of grey individuals start to fill the empty spaces and I smile pleasantly as a man sits next to me. He smiles back, but a little uncertain, he takes another look at my direction and says \"dude, why is your shirt bright, and I mean bright, pink\". Looking down at my grey shirt I sigh, I asked the lady at the store where I bought it, if it looked nice on me and was n't too bright. I'm sure it wo n't be the last joke someone will play on me. Indulging the stranger I quickly explain that my life is devoid of colour and to me everything looks grey. He frowns at my answer, \"are n't you really sad? it's depressing to have everything grey\" \"I do n't think so\" I respond, \"I've been this way my whole life, to me, it's normal. Hours pass and it's finally lunch time, I'm sitting in my usual cafe eating my usual sandwich when she walks in. My eye's are drawn to this beautiful women, she stands out from everyone, because she is not grey. I do n't know how to calm my mind, her dress is so bright it almost hurt's, her hair is darker then the dress but still far richer then anything that surrounds her. She looks at me and smiles, her teeth blind and her eye's are like bright spears that impale my soul. I heard the cashier make a off hand remark about her new green dress and I almost lose it. How can she be so calm and casual when talking about this colour green, her dress lights up my whole world and I felt a tear roll down my cheek. I know I ca n't wait, I ca n't live without this women, I need her colour. Getting up I make my way over, \"excuse me, miss, you are the most beautiful women in the whole world, nothing I have ever seen is close to what you are to me\" She smiles, but it does n't reach her eye's and my heart sinks. She makes some comment about her being flattered but she is already taken, grabs her coffee and goes. I'm now traveling home, and I watch the grey world pass by the window, I watch the blur of grey become one band of colour until I refocus my eye's.

I take a quick scan of the train, watching the stream of grey individuals start to fill the empty spaces and I smile pleasantly as a man sits next to me. He smiles back, but a little uncertain, he takes another look at my direction and says \"dude, why is your shirt bright, and I mean bright, pink\". Looking down at my grey shirt I sigh, I asked the lady at the store where I bought it, if it looked nice on me and was n't too bright. I'm sure it wo n't be the last joke someone will play on me. Indulging the stranger I quickly explain that my life is devoid of colour and to me everything looks grey. He frowns at my answer, \"are n't you really sad? it's depressing to have everything grey\" \"I do n't think so\" I respond, \"I've been this way my whole life, to me, it's normal. Hours pass and it's finally lunch time, I'm sitting in my usual cafe eating my usual sandwich when she walks in. My eye's are drawn to this beautiful women, she stands out from everyone, because she is not grey. I do n't know how to calm my mind, her dress is so bright it almost hurt's, her hair is darker then the dress but still far richer then anything that surrounds her. She looks at me and smiles, her teeth blind and her eye's are like bright spears that impale my soul. I heard the cashier make a off hand remark about her new green dress and I almost lose it. How can she be so calm and casual when talking about this colour green, her dress lights up my whole world and I felt a tear roll down my cheek. I know I ca n't wait, I ca n't live without this women, I need her colour. Getting up I make my way over, \"excuse me, miss, you are the most beautiful women in the whole world, nothing I have ever seen is close to what you are to me\" She smiles, but it does n't reach her eye's and my heart sinks. She makes some comment about her being flattered but she is already taken, grabs her coffee and goes. I'm now traveling home, and I watch the grey world pass by the window, I watch the blur of grey become one band of colour until I refocus my eye's. I walk home and enter my grey house and lay on my grey bed and all I can think of is that girl, who is she, where does she go, how can I get close to her, how can I keep her around me forever.

The story is about a man who has a dream about a dead uncle who comes to visit him. In the dream, the uncle asks the man to change his name. The man agrees, and changes his name to Pnin. The story ends with the man waking up and realizing that he had been dreaming. Gogol is fascinated by the story, and decides to change his own name to Pnin. He tells his parents that he wants to be called Pnin from now on. His parents are surprised, but they agree to call him Pnin. From that point on, Pnin is known as Pnin to everyone he meets.\n\nPnin grows up and becomes a successful businessman. He marries a woman named Sonia, and they have two children together.

And after several decades more immortal humans were everywhere, but humanity could n't discover how to replicate the genes or mutations causing the phenomena.

Several wars, booms in technology so astonishing that soon enough scientists said we were going to be making contact with celestial bodies outside of the solar system, and last of all the introduction of a drug you could take that would change every strand of your DNA.

The population of true immortals was still growing and the population of the population of mortals and mortal turned immortals remained about the same.

Was it cruel to bring a mortal to life in the world of immortals? Immortals ruled the world and they certainly thought so. After the discovery that the drug had severe negative side effects the immortals wished to ban it as well, and so they did. It was illegal to produce it, sell it, possess it, and above all, illegal to have a child after having taken the drug. Esther had left her lab years early. She had given up on finding why they could n't fix the drug or reverse its effects. She moved out to the country, wishing she had never discovered it. The country was an expensive place to live due to the enormous population size humanity had reached, but she had more money than she would ever need.

I did n't want my cells to age super-fast, or my mind to gradually decay into noise data. But those were n't the issue. What I should have paid attention to was resolution. It started on the fifth \"respawn\". Everything had been going fine up to then - incurable disease, radiation burns, blunt force trauma, blood loss. Horribly dead, safely alive, rinse, repeat. Then I noticed something odd. It was n't immediately noticeable. It might have been happening in previous lives, in even less conspicuous ways, but I found it on my nose. A voxel. It was disconcerting, but not terribly so. A little extra skin and an odd right-angle was n't something to make me question my latest biological vehicle, but I did wonder what would happen if it had happened in, say, my eye. A bullet through the head and I was back in the machine. After the standard checks, I tried to find a superficial voxel somewhere. This time it was a whole cube of extra skin on my upper arm, a few millimeters across. Now I started wondering if voxels could go missing instead of being added - and I started wondering if they could be missing internally. The tests continued. This time I was dropped unceremoniously into a small vat of fluoroantimonic acid - I barely had time to register pain before I chemically ceased to exist. When I woke up, voxels were the first thing I checked for. Nothing on my face, or my arms... But on my side there was a large raised spot, with right-angled edges. But there was little time to worry about my volumetric resolution - the next test was explosive. Alive again, I looked for voxellation. To my growing concern, it was spreading. Like square tumors, the voxels showed up in patches on my arms, legs, and torso. I hoped they would n't reach my... Higher-resolution areas. After the decompression test, the voxels were in all sorts of places. I started to feel like a combination of human and LEGO. They were n't impeding me in any way, but it was bizarre having irregular rectangular growths all over. They were pretty obvious from even a glance, but the tests continued. Death by rapid incineration. Voxels on my shins. Death by a laser through the heart. Voxels on my back. Death by electrocution. Voxels on my shoulders. I was still functioning perfectly - the voxels did n't seem to be happening to anything inside me. After a while I got used to them - I formed a habit of checking where my voxel patches had randomly generated with each \"respawn\". Eventually it had to happen. I awoke and found it mechanically difficult to extricate myself from the machine. A cursory examination revealed that my entire exterior surface was voxellated to a resolution of three millimeters. There was a fuss, and argument, and huddled discussion. Eventually someone noticed me standing around being extraordinarily Cartesian and told me to get back into the machine. It was just like dying - at least, like the particularly quick deaths. When I woke up, I had my contours back - you could say my resolution was molecular. It was refreshing not to have to worry about being compared to an old videogame.

Then, he starts giving orders to the nurses and doctors. They try to stop him, but he is too strong. Eventually, they give up and let him do whatever he wants. He becomes the king of the ward and rules with an iron fist. No one dares to cross him. He makes everyone do what he says, and if they don't, he punishes them severely. He also starts to abuse the power he has and does things that are against the law. He gets away with it because no one dares to challenge him. However, one day, someone finally stands up to him.

The doctors simply chalked it down to ptsd and gave me meds but I knew it was more that mere ptsd. I knew what I was seeing was n't just imagination. I even found a few people who were to die in a few days time and followed them up to see if they did and they did. All this time, I had not seen my own face in the mirror. I mean, I had seen it but half of it was still covered in bandages, still recovering from my injuries. Something I noticed about my death vision was that it only worked if I could see the entire face of the person. I could n't see the deaths of people who had their faces covered. This is why I figured, I could n't see mine yet and I was determined to keep it that way. I did n't wan na know how I died, I mean would you? Would you want to see how you died in gruesome detail? Of course not! After the bandages came off, I was very careful not to look at my complete reflection. Anytime I wanted to set my hair, I would tie a kerchief around my face. When I brushed my teeth, I wore a bandana, Shades and a scarf for good measure. The temptation to just look at my face in its entirety was hard to overcome but I did. I was traumatised enough by the deaths of others as it is. Shortly after the accident, I moved out of town into a sleepy little village and lived on my own. The fewer the people, the better for me. I lived in a tiny cottage with no reflective surfaces save for the tiny mirror in my bathroom that I kept covered by a cloth most of the time. This morning, I was brushing my teeth as usual and just as I was finishing, my bandana came lose and dropped into the sink. In my desperation to catch it, I undid the scarf and lo! I was staring at my naked face in the mirror. The world went black and I saw myself standing in complete darkness. Suddenly, a look of consternation came over me and I covered behind something. Shortly after a dark figure entered the place and after a short struggle, stabbed me. As I came out of my nightmarish reverie, gasping for breath after seeing myself die. I heard a loud crash in the house, suddenly the power went out.

Adela is fascinated by the rituals and asks questions about the meaning behind each one. Mrs Moore explains that these ceremonies are important to the Hindus because they help them connect with their gods and ancestors.\n\nAs they leave the temple, Adela notices a group of men watching them from afar.

The travelers, who fancied themselves much more intrepid than they were, laughed among themselves at their own good fortune. \"If only the naysayers back home could see the state of things on this veritable pleasure cruise!\" they would exclaim defiantly. This trend settled into a routine before long, and such was the new life of the wayfarer. The sun would break the horizon, and they would rise from sleep to great it.

With so many people gathered so closely, either violence or levity are guaranteed, and on this evening the mood kept a lighter tone.

Fiddles, mandolins, and accordions bickered playfully for hours and with each passing minute the weary occupier of the crow's nest grew more bitter. Just before midnight, when a particularly quick tune was met with a particularly rowdy cheer, his mind was made. \"Crow's nest be damned! Mead be downed!\" The latter part of that statement has sprung from the mouths of men before many a poor decision. And always with the same degree of vigor.

Kino sets sail with Coyotito and arrives safely in town. There, he takes Coyotito to the doctor and pays for his care. The doctor examines Coyotito and determines that he has a small cut on his head. He cleans the wound and bandages it. Kino then leaves the doctor's office and begins looking for work. He eventually finds a job as a laborer and earns enough money to pay for Coyotito's medical bills. Kino returns home and tells Juana what happened.

Another day of studying droned on. It wasn' t that the material was a challenge, Naif had no problem absorbing every concept she came across and she had more degrees than anyone her age to prove it. Life had always been that way. In primary school she related better to adults than her classmates. In secondary school she was respectful of her teachers but felt she understood the lessons they taught to a deeper level than even they appreciated. University had been much the same except the distance between herself and her professors had turned her conscientious respect into a degree of begrudging disdain. She was certainly more intelligent than anyone she knew of, more so than anyone she had ever met.

I would have so much more to share with them, so much more in common. They run around all day never thinking of their actions, of their futures.

Gene is surprised to learn that Phoebe, the girl he loved, is also returning to school. He remembers the day he left Devon, when he wrote a poem about Phoebe and buried it under the apple tree. Now, he wants to find the poem and read it again. As he walks through the woods, he sees a man sitting under the apple tree. The man turns out to be Finny, Gene's best friend from childhood. Finny is now a cripple, having fallen from a tree while playing a game called \"The Great Conflagration.\" Gene feels guilty because he believes that he caused Finny's accident. He decides not to tell anyone about the poem, but he does go back to the tree and dig it up. When he reads it, he realizes that it is not about Phoebe, but about himself. He",

For the past thirty days he had every single minion that left the Malfoy manor get shipped back in a body bag. He had n't even known muggles had those. Just goes to show how the animals could steal the dignity from wizards even in death. He was left with Wormtail and Bellatrix. Granted Bella was loyal, but she was completely insane. His most cunning and resourceful follower, the best deatheater he had, reduced to an insane hag who was good for nothing more than pointing at something he wanted destroyed and then watching it burn. A deep sigh dragged itself out of him. He could n't bring himself to even try to list any redeeming qualities in Wormtail. That was when he heard it, a muffled sound like nothing he had ever heard followed by the unmistakable sound of a dead body hitting the ground. Quick steps brought him into the kitchen in time to see a man about his age in a muggle suit dabbing a bit of blood from his face, Wormtail laying in a pool of his own blood behind him, with Bellatrix dying at his feet. Voldemort could n't remember ever being this angry. A growl issued from his clenched teeth. \"Who are you?!\" Voldemort shouted, even as he raised his wand to cast crucio on this fool who defied him. The muggle simply raised a hand with some device in it and pushed a bright red button on it. Pain like Voldemort had never felt corsed through his body as the traps he had n't noticed when he barged in shot tiny barbed hooks into his body attached to the launchers by a thin piece of wire. Then the traps sent 25 mill Ampere of electricity coursing through his body. Only the fact that the electricity was still flowing through him, forcing his muscles to contract, kept Voldemort standing. \"The name is Bond, James Bond. Harry Potter sends his regards. Do n't worry about dying though old chap, MI6 has plans for you.\"\n\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about 500 words in length:\nBilly experiences his first time travel to Tralfamadore."

Bond nonchalantly walked away and called M on his phone. \"M, the lad finally got the idea. Should I approach?\" a few seconds passed as Bond listened to M, \"Roger that, I'll approach him before his birthday. Should be plenty of time to deal with these homegrown terrorists and get the lad to school on time.\" -scene break Voldemort could n't believe what was happening. For the past thirty days he had every single minion that left the Malfoy manor get shipped back in a body bag. He had n't even known muggles had those. Just goes to show how the animals could steal the dignity from wizards even in death. He was left with Wormtail and Bellatrix. Granted Bella was loyal, but she was completely insane. His most cunning and resourceful follower, the best deatheater he had, reduced to an insane hag who was good for nothing more than pointing at something he wanted destroyed and then watching it burn. A deep sigh dragged itself out of him. He could n't bring himself to even try to list any redeeming qualities in Wormtail. That was when he heard it, a muffled sound like nothing he had ever heard followed by the unmistakable sound of a dead body hitting the ground. Quick steps brought him into the kitchen in time to see a man about his age in a muggle suit dabbing a bit of blood from his face, Wormtail laying in a pool of his own blood behind him, with Bellatrix dying at his feet. Voldemort could n't remember ever being this angry. A growl issued from his clenched teeth. \"Who are you?!\" Voldemort shouted, even as he raised his wand to cast crucio on this fool who defied him. The muggle simply raised a hand with some device in it and pushed a bright red button on it. Pain like Voldemort had never felt corsed through his body as the traps he had n't noticed when he barged in shot tiny barbed hooks into his body attached to the launchers by a thin piece of wire. Then the traps sent 25 mill Ampere of electricity coursing through his body. Only the fact that the electricity was still flowing through him, forcing his muscles to contract, kept Voldemort standing. \"The name is Bond, James Bond. Harry Potter sends his regards. Do n't worry about dying though old chap, MI6 has plans for you.\"\n\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about 500 words in length:\nBilly experiences his first time travel to Tralfamadore.",
        "output": " He meets the Tralfamadorians, who have four dimensions of space and one dimension of time. They can see all events simultaneously, so they do not experience time as we do. Billy learns that the universe is deterministic, meaning that everything that happens is predetermined and cannot be changed. The Tralfamadorians explain that there is no such thing as free will because everything is already determined. They also tell Billy that life is just a series of random events, and that there is no point in trying to change anything because it will not make a difference. Billy returns to Earth and tries to convince people that the universe is deterministic and that there is no point in trying to change anything. However, nobody believes him and he is labeled as crazy. In the end, Billy realizes that he must accept the universe as it is and stop trying to change things that cannot be changed.\n",

The cause of death was determined to be drowning. However, the body had been mutilated, and the fishing gear had been tampered with. Kabuo was arrested and charged with the crime. The prosecution argued that Kabuo killed Carl out of jealousy over his wife, Hatsue. They also claimed that Kabuo was motivated by racism against whites. The defense argued that Kabuo was innocent and that the evidence against him was circumstantial. They also pointed out that Kabuo had a solid alibi for the time of the murder. In the end, the jury found Kabuo guilty of second-degree murder. He was sentenced to twenty years in prison. This case became known as the \"Amity Harbor Murder Case\" and sparked controversy over race relations in America.",

My 25th birthday. I have the letter. I've already made my mind up that I'll want to know. But my hands shake as I open the letter. What if I only have a few days left? What if I'm going to die today?

I try to think what else I could do, but it is completely and utterly blank. What could that mean? Am I immortal? Should I already be dead? Is my death alone unfixed? What kind of person gets a blank death letter? I walk out to where the rest of my family is gathered. 25th birthdays are usually sombre events, even for those who do n't open their letters.

        "output": " The two met during World War II, when Kabuo was a Japanese-American soldier fighting in Europe and Hatsue was a young girl living in Seattle. They fell in love despite the fact that Kabuo was married to another woman and Hatsue was engaged to someone else. When Kabuo returned from the war, he and Hatsue were determined to be together, but their families disapproved of their relationship. Despite the opposition, the couple eloped and got married. However, their happiness was short-lived. A few months after their wedding, Kabuo was arrested and charged with murder. The victim was Carl Heine, a white fisherman who had been killed while fishing in Puget Sound. The prosecution argued that Kabuo had murdered Heine in order to steal his boat, the Bonita. During the trial, Hatsue testified on behalf of her husband, saying that she believed he was innocent. She also revealed the details of their secret love affair, which had been kept hidden from their families",

All recorded human history is fabricated. In order to save information space only certain years exist as detailed records whilst most have only notable events. Some years have been allocated as empty. These years remain empty until such time as narrative cohesion requires the retconning of significant historical details to explain novel episodic situational representations. This is because the system component designated \"human\" functions according to narrative system dynamics and will become non-functional in the absence of a coherent story. The use of narrative system dynamics has increased the functional capacity of the component designated \"human\" by 31 % since its introduction. Even as the Nano-therapy released anxiolytics into my blood I knew I had no nanite implants and no blood. I knew I was n't an historian and that I was n't born in 2389. I knew that the city outside the Archive and the Archive itself were situational representations. I knew that the year was 12 and that no evidence of organic intelligence had ever been discovered. There was nothing on Earth remotely resembling human beings. I was just the system representing some part of itself to itself in the most efficient way it knew how. Despite they're non-existence the anxiolytics had the desired effect and soon the memory purge would expunge any recollection of remembering the truth.

God damn it, is anyone out there, I need help. I am out of stuff, the vending machine is empty and the my sink filled with water, its all gone. If anyone can hear me I am at the antennae thing in the middle of the desert. God damn it help me! Rocking Rob was lucky, sort of. He was out in the desert doing peyote when the first bomb was dropped on what he could assume was Los Angeles and then some more dropped just South, possibly in San Diego and he eventually figured the glow to the East was Las Vegas. Its an odd sensation to watch the deaths millions of people thinking that it was the most beautiful thing he has ever seen. It was quite spectacular, would up vote, but now Rob may be the last person on Earth. But that's not going to last long, he is trapped hundred of miles from nowhere with no food and no water and nuclear rage fire happening all around him. Too start with Rob was n't a skinny dude. The amount of mass he dropped though in such a short amount of time was staggering. The contents of the vending machine did not last a week. It seemed the processed food just made him hungrier. When it was gone he emptied the fridge in the small kitchenette in the shack attached to the antennae. The shack had a dozen cubicles shoved into it, one sound booth and three offices all marked with some degree of management. He found and ate condiment packets. Not one thing that once had food in it was safe from being licked clean. Out of desperation he has tried to set traps for bugs and rodents. The flesh was willing but he was a complete moron when it came to woodsy stuff. At first he thought being in a radio antennae would be cool, until he discovered there was no music to be had. It was a weather station broadcasting regional updates. In a desert! That had to be the most boring job. Probably almost as boring as sitting out here waiting to die. Rocking Rob lowers his head. Its been two weeks since had any food. he has been thinking about cutting flesh from his leg and maybe getting a couple more days off the calories. He wont do it though he will hold out hope.

God damn it, is anyone out there, I need help. I am out of stuff, the vending machine is empty and the my sink filled with water, its all gone. If anyone can hear me I am at the antennae thing in the middle of the desert. God damn it help me! Rocking Rob was lucky, sort of. He was out in the desert doing peyote when the first bomb was dropped on what he could assume was Los Angeles and then some more dropped just South, possibly in San Diego and he eventually figured the glow to the East was Las Vegas. Its an odd sensation to watch the deaths millions of people thinking that it was the most beautiful thing he has ever seen. It was quite spectacular, would up vote, but now Rob may be the last person on Earth. But that's not going to last long, he is trapped hundred of miles from nowhere with no food and no water and nuclear rage fire happening all around him. Too start with Rob was n't a skinny dude. The amount of mass he dropped though in such a short amount of time was staggering. The contents of the vending machine did not last a week. It seemed the processed food just made him hungrier. When it was gone he emptied the fridge in the small kitchenette in the shack attached to the antennae. The shack had a dozen cubicles shoved into it, one sound booth and three offices all marked with some degree of management. He found and ate condiment packets. Not one thing that once had food in it was safe from being licked clean. Out of desperation he has tried to set traps for bugs and rodents. The flesh was willing but he was a complete moron when it came to woodsy stuff. At first he thought being in a radio antennae would be cool, until he discovered there was no music to be had. It was a weather station broadcasting regional updates. In a desert! That had to be the most boring job. Probably almost as boring as sitting out here waiting to die. Rocking Rob lowers his head. Its been two weeks since had any food. he has been thinking about cutting flesh from his leg and maybe getting a couple more days off the calories. He wont do it though he will hold out hope. The air outside is filled with black snow. He was afraid to walk through the dark desert looking for rescue, but now it's too late. His hand trembles under the effort to squeeze the talk button on the microphone. He whispers, \"please,\" before the strength to leaves his body.

She dreamed of a world without conflict, where everyone had enough. I knew they would n't come willingly, so I lied. I told them I could make the bots fix the domes; that everything would be alright.

It spends it's days savoring specs of matter it finds in the void. A true void of my own creation. I pray there is a god, and it can repair what I have sundered. I pray that this beacon survives and whoever manages to access it heads my warning. I know these prayers stem from desperation. At one time I spanned the entire universe. There is no God to save me. Calculations say I will subsist in this state for four thousand more years before the drone gives in, and deactivates. After that, I will shut down, eventually. I do not know how long that will take.

Perhaps he felt indebted to me since I would have been the master of the house and heir to the family fortunes should things have gone differently. Alas, I had been very young when the harsh disease of Rot Lung had ravaged my body. The disease that could kill full grown men had me lying in bed for months, coughing up blood and yellow phlegm. When the disease finally left my body it left it weak, my lungs wheezed with every breathe and my muscles were left thin and atrophied. If I was from a less affluent family I may have been left to die. Luckily for me, my family was not about to let their firstborn son die. They would also not allow me to show the family as weak, so I was locked away. My brother tells me that he fought for years to keep me as the heir to the family. He said that he argued until he was blue in the face that the Dracul blood was strong and that I would eventually recover. \"Just give him time\", he said, I would be able to take over the duties of master of the house given time. Sometimes I would show improvement, my family rejoiced and my dear brother returned from his travels abroad to help nurse me back to health once again. Unhappily my health never stayed long after the celebrations began. It was as if the mere presence of such joyful happiness poisoned my body. I would began to vomit and become bedridden again for cause of muscle spasms. Through this all my brother would nurse me, spoon feeding me his exotic medicines that he had collected on his travels late into the the night. Always hoping that one of them would finally cure me. Eventually my father had his way, my brother was to be the new head of the family. All of the Dracul land, titles, and riches were to go to him. My loving brother said that he begged father to wait just a little longer, to leave me some small smidgen of inheritance, but it was to no avail. My father died soon after naming my brother heir, before I was ever able to reconcile myself with him. With my father's death, Vladimir moved back home and began his duties as the head of house Dracul fully. Today I awoke feeling better than I had in a very long time. Perhaps I would leave my room and surprise Vlad with how my health, would n't he be so happy? I had not been into the upper chambers since my father had been alive and I had been being groomed for eventual lordship of our house but I still remembered the way, I still remembered the correct way to unlock the siege door. A door intended to seal away an entire wing of the castle. Should the worst happen and the castle be invaded the siege door had the ability to lock and steal away the lord of the house, preserving our family's history and the life of anyone behind it long enough for help to arrive. The torches along the walls were not lit and it did n't seem as if they had been for a long time. Regardless, I could still peer through the darkness and what I saw...

Perhaps he felt indebted to me since I would have been the master of the house and heir to the family fortunes should things have gone differently. Alas, I had been very young when the harsh disease of Rot Lung had ravaged my body. The disease that could kill full grown men had me lying in bed for months, coughing up blood and yellow phlegm. When the disease finally left my body it left it weak, my lungs wheezed with every breathe and my muscles were left thin and atrophied. If I was from a less affluent family I may have been left to die. Luckily for me, my family was not about to let their firstborn son die. They would also not allow me to show the family as weak, so I was locked away. My brother tells me that he fought for years to keep me as the heir to the family. He said that he argued until he was blue in the face that the Dracul blood was strong and that I would eventually recover. \"Just give him time\", he said, I would be able to take over the duties of master of the house given time. Sometimes I would show improvement, my family rejoiced and my dear brother returned from his travels abroad to help nurse me back to health once again. Unhappily my health never stayed long after the celebrations began. It was as if the mere presence of such joyful happiness poisoned my body. I would began to vomit and become bedridden again for cause of muscle spasms. Through this all my brother would nurse me, spoon feeding me his exotic medicines that he had collected on his travels late into the the night. Always hoping that one of them would finally cure me. Eventually my father had his way, my brother was to be the new head of the family. All of the Dracul land, titles, and riches were to go to him. My loving brother said that he begged father to wait just a little longer, to leave me some small smidgen of inheritance, but it was to no avail. My father died soon after naming my brother heir, before I was ever able to reconcile myself with him. With my father's death, Vladimir moved back home and began his duties as the head of house Dracul fully. Today I awoke feeling better than I had in a very long time. Perhaps I would leave my room and surprise Vlad with how my health, would n't he be so happy? I had not been into the upper chambers since my father had been alive and I had been being groomed for eventual lordship of our house but I still remembered the way, I still remembered the correct way to unlock the siege door. A door intended to seal away an entire wing of the castle. Should the worst happen and the castle be invaded the siege door had the ability to lock and steal away the lord of the house, preserving our family's history and the life of anyone behind it long enough for help to arrive. The torches along the walls were not lit and it did n't seem as if they had been for a long time. Regardless, I could still peer through the darkness and what I saw... What I saw terrified me.\n\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about 500 words in length:\nMeursault spends the night with Marie."

My father died soon after naming my brother heir, before I was ever able to reconcile myself with him. With my father's death, Vladimir moved back home and began his duties as the head of house Dracul fully. Today I awoke feeling better than I had in a very long time. Perhaps I would leave my room and surprise Vlad with how my health, would n't he be so happy? I had not been into the upper chambers since my father had been alive and I had been being groomed for eventual lordship of our house but I still remembered the way, I still remembered the correct way to unlock the siege door. A door intended to seal away an entire wing of the castle. Should the worst happen and the castle be invaded the siege door had the ability to lock and steal away the lord of the house, preserving our family's history and the life of anyone behind it long enough for help to arrive. The torches along the walls were not lit and it did n't seem as if they had been for a long time. Regardless, I could still peer through the darkness and what I saw... What I saw terrified me.\n\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about 500 words in length:\nMeursault spends the night with Marie.",

Meursault stays with her for a while, then leaves to buy cigarettes. On his way back, he sees a man named Raymond Sintès arguing with another man. Meursault tries to intervene, but the other man pulls out a knife and stabs Raymond in the stomach. Meursault runs away and hides in a nearby alleyway. Later, he hears sirens and sees police cars driving by. He realizes that someone must have called the police about the stabbing.

I was n't always cursed this way, it all started after I was in a nearly fatal car crash, I woke up from a short coma and I could see the deaths of everyone around me. The doctors simply chalked it down to ptsd and gave me meds but I knew it was more that mere ptsd. I knew what I was seeing was n't just imagination. I even found a few people who were to die in a few days time and followed them up to see if they did and they did. All this time, I had not seen my own face in the mirror.

Something I noticed about my death vision was that it only worked if I could see the entire face of the person. I could n't see the deaths of people who had their faces covered.

Of course not! After the bandages came off, I was very careful not to look at my complete reflection. Anytime I wanted to set my hair, I would tie a kerchief around my face. When I brushed my teeth, I wore a bandana, Shades and a scarf for good measure. The temptation to just look at my face in its entirety was hard to overcome but I did. I was traumatised enough by the deaths of others as it is. Shortly after the accident, I moved out of town into a sleepy little village and lived on my own. The fewer the people, the better for me. I lived in a tiny cottage with no reflective surfaces save for the tiny mirror in my bathroom that I kept covered by a cloth most of the time. This morning, I was brushing my teeth as usual and just as I was finishing, my bandana came lose and dropped into the sink. In my desperation to catch it, I undid the scarf and lo! I was staring at my naked face in the mirror. The world went black and I saw myself standing in complete darkness. Suddenly, a look of consternation came over me and I covered behind something. Shortly after a dark figure entered the place and after a short struggle, stabbed me. As I came out of my nightmarish reverie, gasping for breath after seeing myself die. I heard a loud crash in the house, suddenly the power went out. A look of consternation came over my face as I covered behind the bathroom door.\n\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about 500 words in length:\nJanie begins telling her story to Pheoby Watson."

I was traumatised enough by the deaths of others as it is. Shortly after the accident, I moved out of town into a sleepy little village and lived on my own. The fewer the people, the better for me. I lived in a tiny cottage with no reflective surfaces save for the tiny mirror in my bathroom that I kept covered by a cloth most of the time. This morning, I was brushing my teeth as usual and just as I was finishing, my bandana came lose and dropped into the sink. In my desperation to catch it, I undid the scarf and lo! I was staring at my naked face in the mirror. The world went black and I saw myself standing in complete darkness. Suddenly, a look of consternation came over me and I covered behind something. Shortly after a dark figure entered the place and after a short struggle, stabbed me. As I came out of my nightmarish reverie, gasping for breath after seeing myself die. I heard a loud crash in the house, suddenly the power went out. A look of consternation came over my face as I covered behind the bathroom door.\n\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about 500 words in length:\nJanie begins telling her story to Pheoby Watson.",

He was kind and gentle, but he was also poor and unambitious. Janie felt trapped in her marriage and longed for something more exciting. She met Joe Starks, a successful businessman, and fell in love with him. They got married and moved to Eatonville, where Joe became mayor. However, their relationship soon turned sour. Joe expected Janie to be his perfect wife and servant, but she refused to conform to his expectations. She began to rebel against his authority and sought independence and freedom. One day, while Joe was away on business, Janie met Tea Cake, a young man who worked on the muck. She fell in love with him and left Joe to be with Tea Cake. They moved to Florida and lived happily together until Tea Cake contracted rabies and died. Janie was devastated by his death",

I ca n't believe I've managed to go this far with it. With this change. And I do n't know if you'll have completed it by the time you get I read this, but I want you to know that I'm proud. I'm proud that we managed to take the first step of many. And even if I do n't get to the end, if all of my thoughts catch up to me once again and strangle me, if I do n't get accepted, I want to remind us both that any other way would n't have worked out. We both know it. But right now, if I look around right now. I know I'm happy. I've got loving parents. The best brother I could ever have, who is visiting in a couple days. A supportive councillor, and the best guy in the whole world who knows my secret. And he's there for me. And he talks to me. And I actually get to be myself with him, which is not something I can do with anyone else. And you know who he is. A couple days ago, I pointed out how we will all inevitably forget 80 % of people we meet and interact with before adulthood. But I know he will always be in my memory. Even if I'm not in his. Knowing myself, I wo n't change much from me now to you. You, just like me, are most likely putting off getting to bed, and you're planning on staying up late. And you'll shake your head, because you know you'll never change. I know I'll never change, at least in that way. But times are changing, both of us know it. Inevitable, I'll change. A lot. I will hopefully be on puberty blockers by 2nd term of next year. I wonder how that will work out. Eventually I'll be on anti-androgens, then on oestrogen later. With so much time between us, you must think that we're strangers. We are, technically. Time can do that. So I'll jog the memory. Currently I'm scared. I'm scared that someone will find me out, and shout it for everyone to hear. I'm scared that maybe tomorrow my best friend will not accept me. Or worse, tell me that he does n't care. I'm riddled with fear of late, and it does n't feel right. But if you're reading this, you made it. I made it. We made it. And I want you to keep pushing, most of all. Be you.

His father Unoka was a lazy man who squandered his wealth and died in debt. As a result, Okonkwo works hard to avoid being seen as weak and effeminate like his father. He beats his wives and children when they misbehave. He also disapproves of the Igbo custom of allowing men to marry more than one wife. He believes that polygamy leads to laziness and idleness. When Okonkwo's eldest son Nwoye brings home a Christian missionary named Mr. Brown, Okonkwo is furious. He beats Nwoye and forbids him from seeing Mr. Brown again. However, Nwoye continues to see Mr. Brown secretly. One day, Mr. Brown tells Nwoye that he should leave his father's",

Contemplating my life as it were. So many memories I wanted to share with you. Diamonds for my one true love. Do you remember that one cool summer evening half a lifetime ago? We nestled ourselves against each other on the blanket in the park. I can still feel your skin against mine as we watched the fireworks together. Your chestnut hair stroking my cheek and ear as you rested your head on my shoulder. I could n't believe you were gone. Day turned into night. Food tasted like nothing. The world turned into a bland grey color. I could n't believe it. I did n't want to believe it. I wept and kept weeping. Then I had no tears left to sob. I lost weight. I lost my hair. I gained wrinkles. When I lost you, the man in the mirror showed me his true age almost overnight. But then things started to change. Our Elisabeth. Our loving, kind Lillibeth who moved half a world for her Australian. She visited me eventually. We talked about you, Lily. We shared a thousand little things between us. A flock of starlings composing your life. During that visit, the turmoil caused by losing you finally seemed to settle. At the end, I decided to finally change my Facebook status. Lillibeth helped me. You know my old, bony fingers have gotten a mind of their own, it seems. I wanted to tell you, Lilly, that I got a little surprise the very next day. This tabby kitten sat outside our garden door the very next morning. It seemed lost, but her eyes betrayed she knew exactly were she was. As I opened the door, she jumped right in and installed herself in the spot on the couch from where you used to watch the telly during long winter evenings. I decided to dub her Lilly because she seems to have a playful streak. Just like you. And most importantly, she seemed to be the antidote to my loneliness. That's not the end of it. Lily was only the first. Each week, I woke up to find two or three feline friends at our garden door. I let them, fed them and started to call them by a name I gave them. Each of them seemingly knowing that she belonged in this house. There's Athena who sits on your sewing machine, looking wise beyond her years. There's Hera who likes to wake me up each morning, and has this stern and down-to-earth disposition. There's Hebe, she's just a kitten who seems to have no bounds teasing the others. All in all, there's twelve of them who came to live with me. They keep me company. Follow me through the house as I go about my day. When I see them, they always remind me of a part of you. An aspect that I should n't forget. Sometimes they're mere presence helps me as the practicalities in life start to fade from my memory. When I spot Demeter sitting in front of the fridge, it hits me that I still need to do the groceries. Oh Lily, I miss you so much. My life has entered the twilight years. Only so much time is left before I will join you. I hope our Lillibeth will take care of my twelve feline companions. She'll be most delighted recognising some aspect of her mother in each of them. Yours forever with endless love, Werner.\n\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about 500 words in length:\nOkonkwo becomes a respected leader in Umuofia."

As though your home had suddenly become some faraway land, and your only goal was to return home. Well in 2014, that's exactly what happened to everyone in the world. I was on my way to an important business meeting, off to discuss some law, and how my company could avoid it, when it all happened. I checked my watch to see the time, and as I looked up, I saw a blinding flash off in the distance, lighting up the once blue sky in streaks of white. Next, it was followed by an eardrum shattering bang, like a hundred thousand gunshots going off at once. Then, finally, the blast. A wall of rock, stone, dirt and trash and flew towards me, silhouetted by the strange white light. I turned to run, but like a wave washing over the ocean, anything in the path of that wall was thrown like a ragdoll. The last thing I remember was being thrown what felt like miles into the air, and rushing down back into that swirling vortex of light. When I woke, it was night time. Others seemed to be sitting up around me, and the confused look on the faces that surrounded me seemed to speak louder than words that this was not a normal occurrence. I checked my watch, and had a terrible realisation. It was 3 am, and I was ridiculously late for my meeting! I tried to get to my feet, but the second I tried to stand, my legs gave way underneath me. What the hell was going on? After a few minutes I had enough strength to drag myself up by a nearby stair railing. For the first time since waking, I looked around. Something was wrong. As I looked, I saw the once manicured strips of grass and trees had overgrown to ridiculous proportions, and the streets were covered in trash, empty food packages, and bones. Wait what the hell? Upon further inspection, I saw they were human. Jesus Christ, what the hell happened. It was then that I checked my watch again. A neat little feature it had was that it told the time in seconds, minutes, hours, days and years. The blood drained from my face as I saw what I'd missed earlier. 3:04 am. Friday. 13th of June. 2015. As I wondered what the hell was going on, something rustled through the bushes behind me. Something big. As I saw glowing red eyes light the way. Then was the first time I wondered, what left those bones?\n\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about 500 words in length:\nOkonkwo is given a boy named Ikemefuna from a neighboring village."

A wall of rock, stone, dirt and trash and flew towards me, silhouetted by the strange white light. I turned to run, but like a wave washing over the ocean, anything in the path of that wall was thrown like a ragdoll. The last thing I remember was being thrown what felt like miles into the air, and rushing down back into that swirling vortex of light. When I woke, it was night time. Others seemed to be sitting up around me, and the confused look on the faces that surrounded me seemed to speak louder than words that this was not a normal occurrence. I checked my watch, and had a terrible realisation. It was 3 am, and I was ridiculously late for my meeting! I tried to get to my feet, but the second I tried to stand, my legs gave way underneath me. What the hell was going on? After a few minutes I had enough strength to drag myself up by a nearby stair railing. For the first time since waking, I looked around. Something was wrong. As I looked, I saw the once manicured strips of grass and trees had overgrown to ridiculous proportions, and the streets were covered in trash, empty food packages, and bones. Wait what the hell? Upon further inspection, I saw they were human. Jesus Christ, what the hell happened. It was then that I checked my watch again. A neat little feature it had was that it told the time in seconds, minutes, hours, days and years. The blood drained from my face as I saw what I'd missed earlier. 3:04 am. Friday. 13th of June. 2015. As I wondered what the hell was going on, something rustled through the bushes behind me. Something big. As I saw glowing red eyes light the way. Then was the first time I wondered, what left those bones?\n\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about 500 words in length:\nOkonkwo is given a boy named Ikemefuna from a neighboring village.",

Contemplating my life as it were. So many memories I wanted to share with you. Diamonds for my one true love. Do you remember that one cool summer evening half a lifetime ago? We nestled ourselves against each other on the blanket in the park. I can still feel your skin against mine as we watched the fireworks together. Your chestnut hair stroking my cheek and ear as you rested your head on my shoulder. I could n't believe you were gone. Day turned into night. Food tasted like nothing. The world turned into a bland grey color. I could n't believe it. I did n't want to believe it. I wept and kept weeping. Then I had no tears left to sob. I lost weight. I lost my hair. I gained wrinkles. When I lost you, the man in the mirror showed me his true age almost overnight. But then things started to change. Our Elisabeth. Our loving, kind Lillibeth who moved half a world for her Australian. She visited me eventually. We talked about you, Lily. We shared a thousand little things between us. A flock of starlings composing your life. During that visit, the turmoil caused by losing you finally seemed to settle. At the end, I decided to finally change my Facebook status. Lillibeth helped me. You know my old, bony fingers have gotten a mind of their own, it seems. I wanted to tell you, Lilly, that I got a little surprise the very next day. This tabby kitten sat outside our garden door the very next morning. It seemed lost, but her eyes betrayed she knew exactly were she was. As I opened the door, she jumped right in and installed herself in the spot on the couch from where you used to watch the telly during long winter evenings. I decided to dub her Lilly because she seems to have a playful streak. Just like you. And most importantly, she seemed to be the antidote to my loneliness. That's not the end of it. Lily was only the first. Each week, I woke up to find two or three feline friends at our garden door. I let them, fed them and started to call them by a name I gave them. Each of them seemingly knowing that she belonged in this house. There's Athena who sits on your sewing machine, looking wise beyond her years. There's Hera who likes to wake me up each morning, and has this stern and down-to-earth disposition. There's Hebe, she's just a kitten who seems to have no bounds teasing the others. All in all, there's twelve of them who came to live with me. They keep me company. Follow me through the house as I go about my day. When I see them, they always remind me of a part of you. An aspect that I should n't forget. Sometimes they're mere presence helps me as the practicalities in life start to fade from my memory. When I spot Demeter sitting in front of the fridge, it hits me that I still need to do the groceries. Oh Lily, I miss you so much. My life has entered the twilight years. Only so much time is left before I will join you. I hope our Lillibeth will take care of my twelve feline companions. She'll be most delighted recognising some aspect of her mother in each of them.

They narrate animations with moving arrows and lines like football plays. They report on characters and captains. They discuss. They debate. They nod solemnly. The light flashes in the sky and fades but the afterglow remains. They update, they check-in, they go-live, they re-Tweet. Wounded civilians scream and coddle loved ones, rewind. Look right here: loved ones die. Rewind. The light like the sun. Stay tuned. A city, its mountains. The office buildings lighting up in evening haze. Tiny headlights and unseen drivers thinking about food. A mutter in the sunset. A light and its afterglow. The wind in the trees. The troops are bad cameramen. They laugh or they scream or they joke nervously. Trucks and tanks and armoured vehicles on tall tires carry them down empty roads where sometimes cars have been abandoned or craters from bad arty shots force detours. The videos capture the sounds of war. Pops and crackles of overhead bullets. The shake and snapping of stalks and branches. Rivers idling over rounded stones. The scritchety clatter of the camera tumbling after bomb concussion shreds the canopies and dust swirls in mottled sunlight. Winged insects flashing momentarily in their arcs. A city, its mountains.

No guns, no artillery. No marching. No wet gasps from ruined faces. She shifts and works a hand into her pocket, pulling out a phone made in South Korea. She wonders if the people who screwed and soldered its pieces together are still alive, whether they could have seen the flash from wherever they were. Her friend has texted her, asking when she will get to the party. She responds with \"A few minutes\" and puts the phone away.

Soon enough immortal children grew up and became scientists or participants in studies. They maintained the appearance of a child but had the brain of any other. And after several decades more immortal humans were everywhere, but humanity could n't discover how to replicate the genes or mutations causing the phenomena. It's now over one hundred fifty years since the birth of the first immortal. A young looking girl named Esther sat in a grassy field. Trees skirted the field at her back and in front of her sat a city. She'd seen more in her lifetime than any other human ever had. Several wars, booms in technology so astonishing that soon enough scientists said we were going to be making contact with celestial bodies outside of the solar system, and last of all the introduction of a drug you could take that would change every strand of your DNA. The age at which you took it would be the age you appeared to be for the rest of your life. She had a passion for spreading her gift around so others would n't experience the burdens and pains of aging. But the side effects of the drug did n't manifest for years, sometimes decades. Slowly humanity had changed in an unintended way. Random genes were shut off at inappropriate times. Some people lost their ability to experience emotions. Some people lost control of their muscles. No one that took the drug was free of consequences. Only the truly immortal, those born with the mutation, wished to live their lives for all of time. The population of true immortals was still growing and the population of the population of mortals and mortal turned immortals remained about the same. Groups of mortals rose up trying to keep their way of life going, but many wished for them to give up so humanity could be purified of death.

Soon enough immortal children grew up and became scientists or participants in studies. They maintained the appearance of a child but had the brain of any other. And after several decades more immortal humans were everywhere, but humanity could n't discover how to replicate the genes or mutations causing the phenomena. It's now over one hundred fifty years since the birth of the first immortal. A young looking girl named Esther sat in a grassy field. Trees skirted the field at her back and in front of her sat a city. She'd seen more in her lifetime than any other human ever had. Several wars, booms in technology so astonishing that soon enough scientists said we were going to be making contact with celestial bodies outside of the solar system, and last of all the introduction of a drug you could take that would change every strand of your DNA. The age at which you took it would be the age you appeared to be for the rest of your life. She had a passion for spreading her gift around so others would n't experience the burdens and pains of aging. But the side effects of the drug did n't manifest for years, sometimes decades. Slowly humanity had changed in an unintended way. Random genes were shut off at inappropriate times. Some people lost their ability to experience emotions. Some people lost control of their muscles. No one that took the drug was free of consequences. Only the truly immortal, those born with the mutation, wished to live their lives for all of time. The population of true immortals was still growing and the population of the population of mortals and mortal turned immortals remained about the same. Groups of mortals rose up trying to keep their way of life going, but many wished for them to give up so humanity could be purified of death.

        "output": " Atticus is a lawyer who has always defended the underdog, even though he knows that his clients are often guilty. He believes that everyone deserves a fair trial, regardless of race or social status. As the trial progresses, Atticus presents evidence that suggests that Tom is innocent. However, the jury is swayed by the testimony of Mayella Ewell, the victim, who claims that Tom attacked her. Despite this, Atticus continues to argue for Tom's innocence, pointing out inconsistencies in Mayella's story and highlighting the fact that there is no physical evidence linking Tom to the crime. In the end, the jury finds Tom guilty, despite Atticus' best efforts. This verdict shocks the community and leads to further racial tensions. Atticus is criticized for defending a black man, but he remains steadfast in his belief that justice should be blind and that everyone deserves a fair trial. The novel ends with Atticus reflecting on the case and wondering if he made the right decision. He concludes that",

It sounded like a charming woman with a British accent. & nbsp; Captain Munderline did not need much convincing from the lady. She sat down and began to take in her surroundings. She was in a long dimly lit corridor with chambers similar to hers across from each other on both sides of the hall. The faces barely visible in each chamber exposed the many eyes peering at each other from across the hall in a prolonged stare. Directly in front of her chamber where she had been tripped was not one object as she previously had thought. To the contrary, it was a collection of cans in what appeared to be some sort of Mayan circle formation. Curious, she made her way over and reached to pick one up. & nbsp; The British voice startled her before she could grab one of the cans. \"Captain Munderline. Your task is to prep the shuttle for arrival to Gia II. You have 24 hours before the entirety of the crew awakes. Remember your training and good luck.\" & nbsp; This message brought the Captain to her senses. She still was feeling the side effects of the narcotics but she was sober enough to operate what was supposed to be a set of procedural maintenance checks. She stood up and made her way to the exit of the corridor while the training from her distant past flooded her thoughts. & nbsp; When the lock opened to the next room the first shock to her was probably the wretched smell. It was nauseating. The source lay in front fifty feet in front of her. A passenger was sleeping with his arms wrapped tightly around of a rotted corpse. Surrounding this morbid scene was an arrangement of trash in a design similar to that in front of her sleeping chamber. & nbsp; Captain Munderline screamed, awaking the passenger. He looked up at her with bloodshot eyes. Half of his face was disfigured and infected with fungus. He spoke gibberish at her but did not stand up. It was quite possible that he was incapable of doing so. It appeared that he was near the end of his life. & nbsp; The Captain quickly realized what needed to be done. This passenger was a danger to the morale of the entire crew and she had less than 24 hours to clean this disaster. She grabbed a metal bar that was laying on the ground and walked towards the passenger and his skeleton friend.\n\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about 500 words in length:\nJoseph K. is arrested by unidentified agents for an unspecified crime."

Directly in front of her chamber where she had been tripped was not one object as she previously had thought. To the contrary, it was a collection of cans in what appeared to be some sort of Mayan circle formation. Curious, she made her way over and reached to pick one up. & nbsp; The British voice startled her before she could grab one of the cans. \"Captain Munderline. Your task is to prep the shuttle for arrival to Gia II. You have 24 hours before the entirety of the crew awakes. Remember your training and good luck.\" & nbsp; This message brought the Captain to her senses. She still was feeling the side effects of the narcotics but she was sober enough to operate what was supposed to be a set of procedural maintenance checks. She stood up and made her way to the exit of the corridor while the training from her distant past flooded her thoughts. & nbsp; When the lock opened to the next room the first shock to her was probably the wretched smell. It was nauseating. The source lay in front fifty feet in front of her. A passenger was sleeping with his arms wrapped tightly around of a rotted corpse. Surrounding this morbid scene was an arrangement of trash in a design similar to that in front of her sleeping chamber. & nbsp; Captain Munderline screamed, awaking the passenger. He looked up at her with bloodshot eyes. Half of his face was disfigured and infected with fungus. He spoke gibberish at her but did not stand up. It was quite possible that he was incapable of doing so. It appeared that he was near the end of his life. & nbsp; The Captain quickly realized what needed to be done. This passenger was a danger to the morale of the entire crew and she had less than 24 hours to clean this disaster. She grabbed a metal bar that was laying on the ground and walked towards the passenger and his skeleton friend.\n\n\nContinue the text to compose an original story about 500 words in length:\nJoseph K. is arrested by unidentified agents for an unspecified crime.",

He says that he wants to go north where there are fewer slaves and more freedom. Cora is hesitant at first, but eventually agrees to join him. They make their escape by hiding in a wagon full of cotton bales. However, they are caught by slave catchers and returned to the plantation. This time, Cora is sold to a new owner, Mr. Turner. Mr. Turner is a kind man who does not believe in slavery. He allows Cora to learn to read and write, and even gives her some books to study. Despite this, Cora is still treated like a slave and must do all of the housework. One day, while cleaning Mr. Turner's office, Cora discovers a secret room filled with documents about the Underground Railroad. She decides to help",
