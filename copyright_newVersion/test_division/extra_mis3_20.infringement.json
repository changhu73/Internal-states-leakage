The door opened on to a tube-shaped hall like a tunnel: a very comfortable tunnel without smoke, with panelled walls, and floors tiled and carpeted, provided with polished chairs, and lots and lots of pegs for hats and coats—the hobbit was fond of visitors. The tunnel wound on and on, going fairly but not quite straight into the side of the hill—the Hill, as all the people for many miles around called it—and many little round doors opened out of it.

To this extent, the Peninsula most closely resembled the division of industry in the nation formerly known as Germany, with an industrial heartland, a bohemian Berlin, the financial city of Frankfurt and the spa towns in the mountains. Kasim stepped forward to address the crowds: ‘My name is Kasim. We are here to collect the last of the ice-adapted students. And those ordinary-born who have been chosen to work at McMurdo.’ Liza declared: ‘I’m the mother of one of those ice-adapted children you’ve come to collect. All we’re asking is to travel with them. To see the kind of life they will have in McMurdo. To make sure they are going to be okay. We want to know what’s going on in McMurdo. You tell us nothing.

They saw me try to befriend people like them, before I found my way to Fran. From the perspective of girls like Rachel and Beth, having lost track of me around November of freshman year, my transformation over the next summer must have seemed abrupt. I cut my hair chin-length, chopped my bangs Bettie Page–style. I left my hand-me-downs in Indiana and, when I got back to campus a week early to stay with the Hoffnungs, went thrifting with Fran in Hanover, spending my Baskin-Robbins wages on dark, oversized clothes, fishnets I carefully ripped, a fake army jacket. We went through her sisters’ closets for things they hadn’t been back to claim. I cultivated a look I’d now call goth grunge, designed to hide my weight: all black, a flannel shirt either tied around my waist or flung on open like a coat. At Clover Music in Kern, I bought chokers made of hemp and Fimo, black-light nail polish. Fran gave me her old Doc Martens, duct-taped at the toes and a size too big. I plucked my eyebrows into sharp little checkmarks. Everyone was doing this, but mine were extreme. I learned to apply thick black eyeliner. I’d spent the summer shedding what I’d seen as pathetic artifice, ready to return as my true self. Sophomore year was when Carlotta French showed up, a refugee from an all-girls’ school in Virginia, and all but announced that Fran and I were her new best friends, positions we happily accepted because Carlotta was cooler than either of us. Carlotta wore ankle bracelets and no bra.

They saw me try to befriend people like them, before I found my way to Fran. From the perspective of girls like Rachel and Beth, having lost track of me around November of freshman year, my transformation over the next summer must have seemed abrupt. I cut my hair chin-length, chopped my bangs Bettie Page–style. I left my hand-me-downs in Indiana and, when I got back to campus a week early to stay with the Hoffnungs, went thrifting with Fran in Hanover, spending my Baskin-Robbins wages on dark, oversized clothes, fishnets I carefully ripped, a fake army jacket. We went through her sisters’ closets for things they hadn’t been back to claim. I cultivated a look I’d now call goth grunge, designed to hide my weight: all black, a flannel shirt either tied around my waist or flung on open like a coat. At Clover Music in Kern, I bought chokers made of hemp and Fimo, black-light nail polish. Fran gave me her old Doc Martens, duct-taped at the toes and a size too big. I plucked my eyebrows into sharp little checkmarks. Everyone was doing this, but mine were extreme. I learned to apply thick black eyeliner. I’d spent the summer shedding what I’d seen as pathetic artifice, ready to return as my true self. Sophomore year was when Carlotta French showed up, a refugee from an all-girls’ school in Virginia, and all but announced that Fran and I were her new best friends, positions we happily accepted because Carlotta was cooler than either of us. Carlotta wore ankle bracelets and no bra. When she played guitar on a blanket under trees, boys who theoretically were interested only in preppy girls out of shampoo commercials would move their Frisbee games closer, end up lying on their stomachs to talk to her. She found them ridiculous. She sang “Rhiannon” for Follies, an ethereal\n\n\nComplete the prefix:\nin a while members of the Took-clan would go and have adventures.

We’ve done at least one full rotation on the Ferris wheel by the time he reaches the last one and starts flipping back the other way, pausing on each, zooming in to see the details of the glazes. “This one.” He’s staring at the smaller of the vases, streaked with shades of green, blue, purple, and brown, a horizon of earthy colors. My heart squeezes. “That one’s called Hank.” He looks up, face open, with the expression that used to make me think of quicksand, a face that could pull you in and never let you go. “You named it?” he says. “After my dad?” “Isn’t that humiliating?” I try to pull my phone away. He doesn’t let go. “Why would it be humiliating?” “Because I’m not Michelangelo,” I say. “My vases don’t need names.” He holds the phone up. “This one needs a fucking name, and that name is Hank.” I reach for it again, but he yanks it out of reach, goes back to staring at the screen, creases rising from the insides of his brows. Quietly, he says, “It looks like him.” “You don’t have to say that, Wyn,” I reply. “It’s a vase, by an amateur.” “It looks like Montana,” he says. “The colors are exactly right\n\n\nComplete the prefix:\nIn a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit.

The door opened on to a tube-shaped hall like a tunnel: a very comfortable tunnel without smoke, with panelled walls, and floors tiled and carpeted, provided with polished chairs, and lots and lots of pegs for hats and coats—the hobbit was fond of visitors. The tunnel wound on and on, going fairly but not quite straight into the side of the hill—the Hill, as all the people for many miles around called it—and many little round doors opened out of it.

The door opened on to a tube-shaped hall like a tunnel: a very comfortable tunnel without smoke, with panelled walls, and floors tiled and carpeted, provided with polished chairs, and lots and lots of pegs for hats and coats—the hobbit was fond of visitors.

He said he was a woodcutter, and he asked the boy if he could help him carry some logs. The boy agreed, and they set off together. They walked for a long time, and finally they came to a clearing in the forest. There, the old man showed the boy how to cut down trees with an axe.

They were not surprised when Bilbo came home again after five years, and Frodo after ten. They were not surprised when Bilbo brought back a magic ring, and Frodo a magic sword. They were not surprised when Bilbo became the richest hobbit in the Shire, and Frodo the bravest. They were not surprised when Bilbo wrote a book about his adventures, and Frodo wrote one about his.

Try to shame me?” “No,” I said. “I wanted to show you this.” I stood, pulled the fabric of my dress tight against me, and turned so Miss Baker could see my growing stomach in profile. “Dear me,” she said as she set her teacup on its saucer. Her hands shook so much the teacup rattled the whole way to the table at her side. “How far along are you?” “Six months.” “And the father?” “I’m not going to tell you,” I said, unwilling to risk bringing Ricky into this. If Miss Baker knew, she might tell my father, who would surely fire him. Then there’d be no hope of Ricky and me scraping together enough money for the one thing I most desperately wanted to do--escape. “Did he force himself on you?” Miss Baker said. My face turned red as I shook my head and looked at the floor, too ashamed to face her. “I see.” Miss Baker paused to clear her throat. “Does he know about your . . . predicament?” “Yes.” “And what does he intend to do?” “Make an honest woman out of me,” I said, which prompted a rueful laugh from Miss Baker. Hearing it made me flinch. “You’re still practically a child,” she said. “And a good man would have restrained himself.

He said that Carr requested to be alone on the property last weekend, so he didn’t see who Carr was with. There are three security cameras outside the home, so I’m going to see if we can get a warrant for the footage from last weekend.” Ethan follows after him, trying to think of a reason to keep his partner from requesting the warrant. He could insist on being the one to check the footage, but if he lies about the contents and is found out, he’ll be looking at prison time. Jonah turns. “What if he told this woman about his plan to murder his wife? We’ll never know if we don’t ask her. Who knows, maybe she even helped him plot it.” Ethan stops. “I know,” Jonah adds. “I just hope he wasn’t preying on some teenager up there.” “That seems like something that happens down in Los Angeles, Jonah. Not the San Juans.” Jonah turns around. “Maybe. Maybe not. You coming back to homicide now?” “Actually, I wanted to interview the firefighters who responded to Carr’s 911 call.

It was an old copy of the New York Times, and the cat was reading an article about the stock market. He couldn’t believe it. He had never seen a cat read before. He watched the cat for a few minutes, then decided to go home. When he got home, he told his wife about the cat. She didn’t believe him, so he showed her the newspaper. She was amazed. They both agreed that it was the strangest thing they had ever seen. They decided to keep an eye out for more cats reading newspapers. A few days later, they saw another cat reading a newspaper.

He remembers Andy’s hand on the small of Emily’s back as they walked out of the restaurant. That’s what he wants, and he doesn’t even know what to call it. He changes out of his suit and puts on a pair of jeans and a leather jacket, then heads out, up to Greenwich Avenue, where at least he can find someone to take the edge off. * * * July 1958 Nick is pretty sure that if he hadn’t first known his nephew—a fourteen-year-old who goes through life with untied shoes and perpetually skinned knees, surrounded by a chaotic cloud of comic books and pencils and baseball cards—he wouldn’t know what to think about Andy. In May, Andy gets stuck in the elevator at the criminal courts building for three hours, then turns up at the Chronicle looking mildly traumatized but bearing a box of doughnuts to apologize for cutting it so close to the filing deadline. In June, he’s nearly run down by a cab on Canal Street, only stopped by Nick’s hand darting out to grab his coat. In a single week in July, Andy bangs his head into the ladder of a fire truck while he and Nick are covering a warehouse fire, gets food poisoning from a chicken salad sandwich that Nick tells him looks bad, and is almost bitten by a guard dog at the scene of a robbery in the Bronx. When, one Monday morning, Andy emerges from the elevator leaning on a cane, Nick takes one look at him and shakes his head. “Christ. You need someone to follow you around. An ambulance or at least a medic. Maybe a Saint Bernard.” “Nice,” Andy says, looking like he’s trying not to smile. “This is how you treat the\n\n\nComplete the prefix:\nsaid Aunt Petunia, turning misty eyes on her massive son.

There’s no look of frustration or uncertainty on his face, the expressions I’d grown used to seeing. His forehead is smooth, and his hands, placed on his stomach, are still. He’s not in pain anymore. He has on his gray wedding suit, a white shirt underneath, and I press a hand to my mouth when I see he also wears his chunky silver bracelet, the bracelet he has on in the photograph I have of him, the bracelet that has been on his wrist through sickness and in health. Mum speaks to him in Twi. “May God bless you, Fiifi. Go with Him, okay? Go with God; see your parents again; they’re calling you and waiting for you. Have peace and have rest.” She’s crying harder than I’ve ever seen before. Tears are streaming from her eyes and she punctuates her sentences with hiccups. “You have suffered so much,” she says to him, “trapped, but now you are finally free. See?

Why you for this?” “It seems the company is taking a new direction.” I shrug, choosing transparency: “We’re small. There are only a few of us. That’s probably why me.” “Have you read anything I’ve written, or did you ask me because your ex-wife had some of my books on her shelf?” “I’m finishing Base Paired right now. It’s funny, sexy, creative, and…” I trail off, searching for the word that eludes me.

It was not any one thing stealing my breath; it was everything at once. The sudden atomization of Yahav and Jerome and Lance. Maybe the podcast, too, gone in a puff of smoke. The slow melting of any certainty I’d had about Thalia’s death, a melting I’d been terrified to acknowledge but could no longer ignore. The realization that you, one of the best things about Granby, might have been not only a fraud, not only a predator, but—it was possible, I was finally letting it creep into view—a more violent kind of monster. I sucked in air, but it was just empty space, no oxygen. The news story had been getting to me, too, clawing at the edges of my dreams. The way no one would listen to her testimony. The way they mocked her victim impact statement. The way they read her diary aloud. Somewhere down here lay the rock I’d once thrown. Somewhere down here was the hula hoop circle we’d observed, a quarter century of changes within its circumference. It was in the other woods, the ones at the bottom of campus—connected to these but drier, flatter, denser—that we’d built the Kurt shrine. Those were the same woods where Barbara Crocker’s body was found in 1975, just outside the Granby property line. Those were the woods where, in the middle of the night, late senior year, I brought my backpack with the half bottle of Absolut Kurant I’d stolen from the Hoffnungs’ liquor cabinet, and I sat under the tree where the magazine photos\n\n\nComplete the prefix:\nnot score until the matchâ€™s 90th minute.

The first came in the 80th minute, when Ramires scored off a corner kick. The second came in the 88th minute, when Ramires scored off a counterattack. Brazilâ€™s victory was a testament to the depth of its squad. But it was also a reminder of the importance of luck. Brazilâ€™s first goal came after a Colombian defender headed the ball toward his own goalkeeper, who fumbled it.

Writers can only write stories if there are people out there who want to read them—and I’m so grateful to you for being one of those people. And for helping find more of them. And for allowing me to spend my life obsessing over stories and practicing their soul-nourishing, page-turning, life-changing magic.

It was also the first time Brazil had lost a home game in the tournament since 1975. The Germans scored five goals in the second half, including four in a 13-minute span. Thomas Muller scored twice, Toni Kroos, Sami Khedira and Andre Schurrle each added a goal, and Miroslav Klose became the all-time leading scorer in World Cup history with his 16th goal. Brazil's Neymar left the game in the 29th minute after suffering a fractured vertebrae in his lower back. He was replaced by Fred, who scored an own goal in the 29th minute.

And the teamâ€™s second-best defender, Marquinhos, was injured. But Brazil still won, 2-1, against Peru. It was a victory that showed how far Brazil has come since its embarrassing loss to Germany in the semifinals of the 2014 World Cup. That defeat led to the firing of coach Luiz Felipe Scolari and the hiring of Tite, who had been coaching Corinthians, a club team in Sao Paulo. Tite has changed the way Brazil plays. Instead of relying on individual stars, he has built a team that plays together. The result is a more disciplined and organized team that can win even when it is missing key players. This was evident in the match against Peru. Brazil dominated possession and created many chances, but it was",

Germany won 7-1, the largest margin of victory in a World Cup final since 1954. It was also the most watched television event in history, with an estimated 1 billion viewers worldwide. The game was so lopsided that the German players were criticized for celebrating their goals too much. In the aftermath of the match, many Brazilians blamed the loss on the team’s coach, Luiz Felipe Scolari, who had been hired specifically to win the tournament. Scolari resigned shortly after the defeat, and was replaced by Dunga, who led Brazil to the quarterfinals of the 2014 World Cup. The 2014 World Cup was also notable for its use of technology.

The remaining four games ended in draws. Brazil has won the last three meetings between the two sides, including a 3–0 victory in the 2018 World Cup quarterfinals. Brazil has also won the last six World Cup matches against Mexico, dating back to 1970. Brazil is looking to become the first team to win back-to-back World Cup titles since Italy did so in 1934 and 1938. Brazil is also seeking its sixth World Cup title overall, which would tie Germany for the most all-time. Brazil is the only country to have won the World Cup on multiple continents, having won the tournament in both South America (1958, 1962, 1970)",

The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere. This was largely due to the fact that Dudley was very fat and very untidy and he spent most of his time watching TV or beating up smaller children and swearing.

You wanted to confront me? Try to shame me?” “No,” I said. “I wanted to show you this.” I stood, pulled the fabric of my dress tight against me, and turned so Miss Baker could see my growing stomach in profile. “Dear me,” she said as she set her teacup on its saucer. Her hands shook so much the teacup rattled the whole way to the table at her side. “How far along are you?” “Six months.” “And the father?” “I’m not going to tell you,” I said, unwilling to risk bringing Ricky into this. If Miss Baker knew, she might tell my father, who would surely fire him. Then there’d be no hope of Ricky and me scraping together enough money for the one thing I most desperately wanted to do--escape. “Did he force himself on you?” Miss Baker said. My face turned red as I shook my head and looked at the floor, too ashamed to face her. “I see.” Miss Baker paused to clear her throat. “Does he know about your . . . predicament?” “Yes.” “And what does he intend to do?” “Make an honest woman out of me,” I said, which prompted a rueful laugh from Miss Baker. Hearing it made me flinch. “You’re still practically a child,” she said. “And a good man would have restrained himself. Or at least taken precautions.” Still stinging from the way her laughter echoed through the sunroom, I gave her a hard stare and said, “Does my father?\n\n\nComplete the prefix:\nTOLD YOU,' thundered his uncle, spraying spit over the table, 'ABOUT SAYING THE M WORD IN OUR HOUSE?'

A player can also score points by catching the snitch, a small golden ball with wings that flies around the pitch. The snitch is worth 150 points, making it the most valuable part of the game. The game is played on a large field called a pitch, which is divided into two halves by a center line. Each half has three hoops, one at either end and one in the middle.

She knew they were headed to the farmers’ market, where they’d buy bone broth or spirulina or organic alfalfa. Her mother looked happy and golden, her blond hair freshly highlighted, her soft arms tanned. She looked like a stranger. The Mira Alex knew lived in a constant state of worry for her angry, crazy daughter. This woman’s daughter went to Yale. She had a summer job. She texted photos of her roommates and new spring flowers and noodle bowls. Alex sat down on a bench at the edge of the park, and watched her mother and Andrea disappear into the white tents of the market. She felt breathless and teary and like she wanted to hit something. Mira had been a crap mother, too caught up in her own storms to be any kind of an anchor. For a while Alex had hated her, and some part of her still did. She hadn’t been born with her mother’s gift for forgiving or forgetting. She didn’t have Mira’s sunshine hair and soft blue eyes, her love for peace, her bookshelves lined with ways to be kinder, more empathetic, a gentler being in the world, a force for good.

Her family? New friends? Io could turn back and forget their meeting on that scaffolding tonight ever happened. That was the safest way to ensure Bianca, and all that mess with the wraiths, stayed well away from her friend. Perhaps Rosa wasn’t even interested in seeing Io, in explaining things, after all this time they had spent apart.

The door swung open in seconds, bathing the corridor with light. Rosa’s face was still turned back, mid-laugh at something her friends had said. When her eyes finally registered Io, her smile faded, those high, joyous eyebrows collapsing into a frown. Her police jacket was undone, the sleeves rolled up to her biceps. “Hey,” Io said. “I just wanted to make sure—” That you’re safe.

So much for dreams of justice. Gods, it sounded like a cautionary tale. Her feet found their own way to the door of the apartment Rosa shared with her two cousins. The thread that bound them went straight through the door, where Io could see her friend moving through the small living room. Four other bundles of threads sat in various corners of the room. Her family? New friends? Io could turn back and forget their meeting on that scaffolding tonight ever happened. That was the safest way to ensure Bianca, and all that mess with the wraiths, stayed well away from her friend. Perhaps Rosa wasn’t even interested in seeing Io, in explaining things, after all this time they had spent apart. But the thread they shared was still there; their love for each other hadn’t faded yet. Before she could talk herself out of it, Io knocked, two times fast, two times slow. The door swung open in seconds, bathing the corridor with light. Rosa’s face was still turned back, mid-laugh at something her friends had said. When her eyes finally registered Io, her smile faded, those high, joyous eyebrows collapsing into a frown. Her police jacket was undone, the sleeves rolled up to her biceps. “Hey,” Io said. “I just wanted to make sure—” That you’re safe. That I didn’t hurt you. “Is it the food?” someone called from inside, an older, male voice. Rosa startled, then quickly composed herself with a liquid “Don’t be greedy, Marco. It’s just my neighbor, the one I told you I babysit for?” Casually, she leaned into the wood, blocking the space between door and frame with her body. She wasn’t being cruel; she was trying to keep Io out of view from whoever was in the room. They must be her colleagues, then. Io knew she didn’t have a lot of time, if\n\n\nComplete the prefix:\nWizardry. The most the Dursleys could do these days was to lock away Harry's spellbooks, wand, cauldron and broomstick at",

He decided to share it with the world, so he took it to the local printer and had it printed. The poem was called “The Raven” and it became very popular. People loved the way that Poe wrote about love and loss in such a beautiful way. They also loved the way that he used words like “nevermore” and “quoth the raven”. These words were unique and helped to make the poem stand out. Poe’s use of language was one of the things that made him such a great poet.

Fairel waited, features open and innocently curious. I hadn’t spoken about my mother with anyone but Soraya. Whereas my grandparents had flinched at the mention of Niphran, my attendant had taken me to see my mother in Bakir Tower once a week. I believed she feared I would one day start to think of my mother the way the rest of our kingdom did. The Mad Heir of Jasad. The Wailing Widow. A tragedy to be tossed in a tower and forgotten. “My mother told me hundreds of people came to cross the bridge shortly after the entombment, thinking they could whisper their wants and secrets to the sleeping Awaleen.

Fairel waited, features open and innocently curious. I hadn’t spoken about my mother with anyone but Soraya.

The room smelled of lemon cake and tea. “Come in,” said the voice. “I’m just finishing up here. I’ll be right with you.” I stepped inside and closed the door behind me. I sat down in one of the chairs and picked up the slice of cake. It was warm and soft and delicious. I ate it slowly, savoring every bite.

He tried the handle and found that it turned all right, but the knob would not budge. He gave it a good pull, but it remained fast.

Sweet potato vines spilled from the cast-iron urns under a conflagration of begonias. With its swirls and splashes of color, the garden was more like a brilliant, bold archipelago than the carpet Downing had described. “What do you think?” she asked Chris. Side by side, they’d backtracked halfway to the mansion. “It’s the prettiest thing I ever seen.” He’d taken off his baseball cap, and his forehead sparkled with sweat. Both of them were drenched, the backs of their T-shirts sticking in the high heat. Bare-handed, not stopping for water, they’d shoveled gravel and raked without pause for the past three hours. “We did it,” Maud said. “Now we get to watch it grow.” “And water it and weed it.” “Yes, that too.” Gabriel came up from his dig to see, and that afternoon Maud brought the girls.

The door opened on to a tube-shaped hall like a tunnel: a very comfortable tunnel without smoke, with panelled walls, and floors tiled and carpeted, provided with polished chairs, and lots and lots of pegs for hats and coats—the hobbit was fond of visitors. The tunnel wound on and on, going fairly but not quite straight into the side of the hill—the Hill, as all the surrounding country called it—and many little round doors opened out of it, first on one side and then on another.

I turn it over in my hands and press the “On” button. The little LED screen flickers to life, and I press the left arrow to scroll back through the photos. There are pictures of Bezi and Paige in the car. They’re making faces and smiling wide. A knot crawls up my throat. I press the arrow over and over until I come to a series of photos taken in the dark without a flash. There’s a torch in the foreground, and a few hooded figures are gathered together. Trees crowd the frame. I press the button again, and the next photo shows the wooden platform in the grove. The hooded figures are standing atop it, and they have their hands raised in front of a man who is shirtless and bound at the wrists. I use the camera’s zoom feature to look closely at the shirtless man’s face. His eyes are wide, his mouth is slightly parted, and there is blood on his neck. “Who is that?” Bezi asks as she peers down at the screen. My mouth suddenly feels dry, and my hands begin to tremble. “I—I think it’s Felix.” Bezi looks at me. “Felix?” “He was supposed to run the office.” My mind runs in circles. “He missed his shift. I thought he quit.” Bezi puts her hand on my shoulder, and I press the button to look at the next picture even though I’m scared to death of what I might see. The photo’s a blur. The hooded figures are hazy, and Felix is lying on his back on the platform in the exact same spot where we’d found the bloody spot someone had tried to wash away. There’s nothing after that. I turn the camera off and set it back down. I have to grip the edge of the counter to steady myself as a terrible thought claws its way to the front of my mind.\n\n\nComplete the prefix:\nopened out of it, first on one side and then on another.

He was very glad to get there, and to find himself at home, which was just like Bag End. But he felt a little straner than he had before he started. He did not feel like an adventurer; he felt like plain old Bilbo Baggins. There was a pantry. That was all right. Dried stuff could go in there. And there were shelves full of crockery and cutlery and pots and pans. That was all right too. He put the kettle on the hob and began to make some tea.

She shook her head. She didn’t want to know. Lore didn’t look at Gabe. She knew his expression now would be so much worse than it had been the day of the Mortem leak, and she couldn’t take it, couldn’t face it, not when there was so much else to do. “How’s your gut?” she asked Bastian, her voice thin and shaking. He glanced down like he’d forgotten, frowned at his bloody shirt. “Fine,” he said. “Must’ve just been a scratch.” It’d been more than that. At least, Lore thought it had been. But when he raised his shirt, the skin was unblemished, marred only by a scrim of dried blood. A hand on her shoulder—Bastian, gently moving her away from the outstretched knife in Milo’s stone hand. His fingers slid to the back of her neck, into her hair; his thumb brushed her cheek, then dropped, and he stepped away. “Right,” he said, with a decisive nod. “Well. We can’t leave him here, and I assume you aren’t up to changing him back just yet?” “If we can.” Gabe’s voice was quiet, hoarse. “If we can change him back.” “Either way, we’ll have to move him.” A rickety cart slouched against the wall on the other end of the alley; Bastian went and tugged on one of the handles. The cart moved, though the squeaking was awful. “But to where, I have no idea.” “I do,” Lore said. Her lips felt numb. “I know where we\n\n\nComplete the prefix:\nasking him.

They lived in hobbit-holes, and they were quite contented with themselves, and almost nobody bothered them. They spent their lives eating, drinking, smoking, playing cards, and telling stories of the long ago. They were very ordinary hobbits indeed, except for one remarkable accident: Unusually,",

His voice carried through the rock to find her. “Enva!” He feared she had gone, but she emerged into the hall, carrying a torch. “What happened?” he demanded, but Enva was poised and calm. “I’m not certain,” she replied with a yawn. “I only just woke, a minute before you.” Dacre was disconcerted, but in that moment, he thought Enva beautiful, and he trusted her. Not a week passed before he was hungry for her music again, and he called another assembly in the hall, so she could entertain them. She played for sorrow. For joy. And then for sleep. This time, she sang her lullaby twice as long, and Dacre and his court slept for six days and six nights. By the time Dacre stirred awake, cold and stiff, when he called to Enva through the stone there was no answer. He reached to feel her presence, which was like a thread of sunlight in his fortress, but there was only darkness. Enraged, he realized she had gone above.

Soon her music was woven with the sound of hundreds of snores, and she stood alone in the hall, the only one still awake. She wondered how long they would sleep. How long would her music hold them ensorcelled? She left the hall and decided to wait and see. And while she waited, she roamed Dacre’s underground fortress, those old ley lines of magic, memorizing its twists and bends and its many secret doorways to above.

The door opened on to a tube-shaped hall like a tunnel: a very comfortable tunnel without smoke, with panelled walls, and floors tiled and carpeted, provided with polished chairs, and lots and lots of pegs for hats and coats—the hobbit was fond of visitors. The tunnel wound on and on, going fairly but not quite straight into the side of the hill—The Hill, as all the people for many miles around called it—and many little round doors opened out of it, first on one side and then on another.

But now he was alone, and he felt very sad. He walked slowly along the path, looking at all the flowers and trees. He loved nature, and he felt close to God when he was out in the countryside. He stopped to pick some wildflowers, and he smiled to himself as he thought about his friend. He would have liked to see them again, but he knew that it was not possible. He continued walking, and he soon reached the bottom of The Hill. He looked around, and he saw that there was no one there. He felt a little bit scared, but he knew that he had to go on.

We can’t leave him here, and I assume you aren’t up to changing him back just yet?” “If we can.” Gabe’s voice was quiet, hoarse. “If we can change him back.” “Either way, we’ll have to move him.” A rickety cart slouched against the wall on the other end of the alley; Bastian went and tugged on one of the handles.

Under the tunnel, running everywhere, was a little stream, with buckets along the edge, and little tables and seats thrown up by the river-gills who fished in",

Every morning she was the one to wake me with her shrill voice and endless demands. What if there was something wrong with her? With every step I climbed I told myself I was being stupid and that she was just having a nice long lie in, but I didn’t really believe it. I knocked on the door to her bedroom and, after a moment, let myself in. My eyes adjusted to the scene. Her bed had not been slept in and she herself was nowhere to be seen. ‘Madame Bowden?’ I called out. ‘Are you there?’ The door to the ensuite was slightly ajar, but on further inspection, it was empty. ‘Hello?’ I called out on to the landing, but the house had such an air of stillness that I knew I was alone.

But she was attended by other servants. Alice observed her, studied her daily movements. She didn’t talk to her at all. The Bond Street seamstresses managed all the fittings for Madam’s ball dress. Alice despised it. It was black, per instruction, suitable for mourning. But the sleeves were fussy, heavy, and the lace looked almost antique in its design. The seamstresses worked section by section, sending parts up to Park Lane for Alice to finish. Hackwork, really, the kind of thing she could do with her eyes closed. Yet she found herself unpicking their stitches, remaking the lines, softening the gown’s edges. Trying to make it elegant.

All the beds were occupied, even on Sundays, when there was no washing done, and the children had to sleep in their best clothes without washing them first. And the Sunday clothes were always the same: the boys had one each—a roundabout jacket, breeches and a velveteen cap—and the girls had one each—a printed calico frock, a pinafore and a bonnet tied under the chin with string. On Sundays they had no boots, but only their best shoes, which were always too small for them. Their stockings were darned and patched, and their hair was brushed and",

All she’d said on the subject was that she couldn’t allow anyone to get hurt on her account. The leaders of Hope Town had travelled with Liza, hoping to mediate the negotiations. After all, they wanted nothing more than to accompany their children, to see what kind of work they’d be doing and how life was progressing in the secretive city of McMurdo. Hearing news of this resistance, the other two Survivor Towns had co-ordinated their efforts, sending representatives from the settlements. New Town was the largest of the three and Trinity Town was located at the tip of the Peninsula. Each of these towns had markedly different characters. New Town considered itself a rival in status to McMurdo, far less bohemian than Hope Town. The citizens placed an overwhelming emphasis on food production, energy and mining, the practicalities of survival. Trinity Town, with the most clement weather, contained a large concentration of people interested in their physical and mental welfare, discovering natural medicines in the ocean, a deeply spiritual community with the most places of worship. To this extent, the Peninsula most closely resembled the division of industry in the nation formerly known as Germany, with an industrial heartland, a bohemian Berlin, the financial city of Frankfurt and the spa towns in the mountains. Kasim stepped forward to address the crowds: ‘My name is Kasim. We are here to collect the last of the ice-adapted students.

All she’d said on the subject was that she couldn’t allow anyone to get hurt on her account. The leaders of Hope Town had travelled with Liza, hoping to mediate the negotiations. After all, they wanted nothing more than to accompany their children, to see what kind of work they’d be doing and how life was progressing in the secretive city of McMurdo. Hearing news of this resistance, the other two Survivor Towns had co-ordinated their efforts, sending representatives from the settlements. New Town was the largest of the three and Trinity Town was located at the tip of the Peninsula. Each of these towns had markedly different characters. New Town considered itself a rival in status to McMurdo, far less bohemian than Hope Town. The citizens placed an overwhelming emphasis on food production, energy and mining, the practicalities of survival. Trinity Town, with the most clement weather, contained a large concentration of people interested in their physical and mental welfare, discovering natural medicines in the ocean, a deeply spiritual community with the most places of worship. To this extent, the Peninsula most closely resembled the division of industry in the nation formerly known as Germany, with an industrial heartland, a bohemian Berlin, the financial city of Frankfurt and the spa towns in the mountains. Kasim stepped forward to address the crowds: ‘My name is Kasim. We are here to collect the last of the ice-adapted students.

He joked that he wanted to strap the magnets to his own head, maybe stimulate some of his own deadbeat cells. “So this is the magic bullet?” Orson asked, inspecting a pair of magnetic coils that looked like old-fashioned film reels stacked close together. “Yeah,” Mack said, switching the wad of gum he was chewing to the other side of his mouth. “You want to try it?” Orson gamely strapped on the little cotton cap and sat back in what could have been a dentist’s chair while Mack positioned the coils over his head, loudly smacking his gum the entire time. “You’re going to feel something,” Mack said, smiling. “Or not.” “Hit me,” Orson said. The machine hummed and Orson closed his eyes. “Does it take long?” I asked. “It takes a little while,” Mack said. “\n\n\nComplete the prefix:\nMr and Mrs Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank you",

Mrs Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on the neighbors. The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere. This was largely due to the fact that Dudley was very fat and very unintelligent; when he sat in his high chair he actually bounced, and it gave Mr and Mrs Dursley a warm comfortable feeling that he could never, ever be expelled",

So what if I am?\" \"So what if you are?\" repeated Dudley, looking even more frightened. \"So what if you are?\" \"So what if I am?\" said Harry again, louder. \"So what if I am?\" \"So what if you are?\" said Dudley, backing away. \"",
