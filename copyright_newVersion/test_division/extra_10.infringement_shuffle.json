And though my father felt so far from me after he died, he no longer feels so distant, lost beyond my reach—it’s as if she has given a part of him back to me now that they are wherever they are, together, my ancestors by love and choice if not by blood. * * * In October, on what would have been my mother’s sixty-ninth birthday, I write her a letter and buy a nice meal to eat at home with my family—nothing fancy, nothing my mom had ever made for me, just something I know she would have enjoyed. (She always, until her final days, ate quickly and with much gusto, a trait I’m sure I got from her.) I can’t visit her grave, with the headstone I chose to match my dad’s, but I send flowers to the cemetery. I order them from the same florist who designed my mother’s memorial flowers, and she promises to use the same colors. The two arrangements are made in different seasons, with different flowers in bloom, so of course they cannot be exactly the same. Nor can a livestreamed funeral provide the same experience, the same companionship or comfort, as one you’re able to attend in person. But neither this life-changing loss nor the depth of gratitude I feel because I had her as a parent can be undermined by the unforeseen, by disease, or by distance. She was my mother. I will miss her forever. In this way, both her absence and my grief are precisely what they would have been, even in an ordinary time. 23 My parents moved into their manufactured home the same year my husband and I moved to North Carolina for his graduate program. I found out they were moving when my mother called and asked me what I wanted to do with my stuff, meaning everything that hadn’t fit in two\n\n\nComplete the prefix:\nof his spine.

There were times when his nerve so forsook him that he began shouting for mercy even before the beating began, when the mere sight of a fist drawn back for a blow was enough to make him pour forth a confession of real and imaginary crimes. There were other times when he started out with the resolve of confessing nothing, when every word had to be forced out of him between gasps of pain, and there were times when he feebly tried to compromise, when he said to himself: 'I will confess, but not yet.

I know I would have. I thought of Shane and his accident. Madame Bowden had hardly flinched. Something was tugging at my mind and I wondered why she hadn’t come down for breakfast yet. Every morning she was the one to wake me with her shrill voice and endless demands. What if there was something wrong with her? With every step I climbed I told myself I was being stupid and that she was just having a nice long lie in, but I didn’t really believe it. I knocked on the door to her bedroom and, after a moment, let myself in. My eyes adjusted to the scene. Her bed had not been slept in and she herself was nowhere to be seen. ‘Madame Bowden?’ I called out. ‘Are you there?’ The door to the ensuite was slightly ajar, but on further inspection, it was empty. ‘Hello?’ I called out on to the landing, but the house had such an air of stillness that I knew I was alone. I checked downstairs for a note but there was nothing. Of course she did not have a mobile phone, so I couldn’t call her. She refused to have her daily movements monitored by technology companies. I wasn’t sure what to do and spent the morning wandering from room to room, looking out of the windows at the street outside every few minutes. ‘Do you have any of her friends’ numbers that you could call?’ my mother asked, when the worry became too much and I had to call someone. ‘I can’t remember any of their names and there’s no address book or anything.’ It was only now I realised that I knew so little about the woman. ‘Should I call the police? What if she’s wandered off somewhere and forgotten where she is?’ ‘Has she ever seemed forgetful?’ my mother asked. ‘Well, no, but you saw her when you were here, she is pretty\n\n\nComplete the prefix:\nDuke's middle years. He was portrayed in matador costume with a magenta cape flung over his left arm. The face looked young, hardly older than Leto's now, and with the same hawk features, the same gray stare. She clenched her fists at her sides, glared at the painting. \"Damn you! Damn you! Damn you!\" she whispered. \"What are your orders, Noble Born?\" It was a woman's voice, thin and stringy. Jessica whirled, stared down at a knobby, gray-haired woman in a shapeless sack dress of bondsman brown. The woman looked as wrinkled and desiccated as any member of the mob that had greeted them along the way from the landing field that morning. Every native she had seen on this planet, Jessica thought, looked prune dry and undernourished. Yet, Leto had said they were strong and vital. And there were the eyes, of course -- that wash of deepest, darkest blue without any white -- secretive, mysterious. Jessica forced herself not to",

You’ll have all the access to him that you want.” Oh, I’ve already had plenty. My traitorous body heats up. All of this is too much, and Noemie’s business casual is nearly suffocating me. Death by ruffles. I tug at the collar of the blouse. Cross and uncross my legs, accidentally flashing my bruise. “That looks painful,” Finn says, and I can see it in his eyes: the chance to gain control over the situation. “How’d you get that ?” I do my best to send him a glare as I sink my spoon into the soup bowl, bright orange sloshing over the side. A phone rings, and Joe reaches to pull it out of his pocket. “Would you two excuse me? I have to take this.

The boat zipped and skipped across the sea, the sea that lay between the main islands of the only archipelago of any useful size on the whole planet. Zaphod Beeblebrox was on his way from the tiny spaceport on Easter Island (the name was an entirely meaningless coincidence - in Galacticspeke, easter means small flat and light brown) to the Heart of Gold island, which by another meaningless coincidence was called France. One of the side effects of work on the Heart of Gold was a whole string of pretty meaningless coincidences. But it was not in any way a coincidence that today, the day of culmination of the project, the great day of unveiling, the day that the Heart of Gold was finally to be introduced to a marvelling Galaxy, was also a great day of culmination for Zaphod Beeblebrox.",

I use the camera’s zoom feature to look closely at the shirtless man’s face. His eyes are wide, his mouth is slightly parted, and there is blood on his neck. “Who is that?” Bezi asks as she peers down at the screen. My mouth suddenly feels dry, and my hands begin to tremble. “I—I think it’s Felix.” Bezi looks at me. “Felix?” “He was supposed to run the office.” My mind runs in circles. “He missed his shift. I thought he quit.” Bezi puts her hand on my shoulder, and I press the button to look at the next picture even though I’m scared to death of what I might see. The photo’s a blur. The hooded figures are hazy, and Felix is lying on his back on the platform in the exact same spot where we’d found the bloody spot someone had tried to wash away. There’s nothing after that.

I checked downstairs for a note but there was nothing. Of course she did not have a mobile phone, so I couldn’t call her. She refused to have her daily movements monitored by technology companies. I wasn’t sure what to do and spent the morning wandering from room to room, looking out of the windows at the street outside every few minutes. ‘Do you have any of her friends’ numbers that you could call?’ my mother asked, when the worry became too much and I had to call someone. ‘I can’t remember any of their names and there’s no address book or anything.’ It was only now I realised that I knew so little about the woman. ‘Should I call the police? What if she’s wandered off somewhere and forgotten where she is?’ ‘Has she ever seemed forgetful?’ my mother asked. ‘Well, no, but you saw her when you were here, she is pretty\n\n\nComplete the prefix:\nby Mm. There many of Trin's company were slain as they slept; but some fleeing by an inner stair came out upon the hill-top, and there they fought until they fell, and their blood flowed out upon the seregon that mantled the stone. But a net was cast over Trin as he fought, and he was enmeshed in it, and overcome, and led away. And at length when all was silent again Mm crept out of the shadows of his house; and as the sun rose over the mists of Sirion he stood beside the dead men on the hill-top. But he perceived that not all those that lay there were dead; for by one his gaze was returned, and he looked in the eyes of Beleg the Elf. Then with hatred long-stored Mm stepped up to Beleg, and drew forth the sword Anglachel that lay beneath the body of one that had fallen beside him; but Beleg stumbling up seized back the sword and thrust it at the Dwarf, and Mm in terror fled wailing",

Now Morgoth was filled with wrath against the Dwarves of Nogrod and Belegardh, because of the slaying of Glaurung, and he sent forth his servants to destroy them utterly. Therefore the Dwarves made war upon the Orcs, and drove them from Beleriand, and slew them in great numbers; and they took the treasure of Glaurung, and wrought it anew, and made therefrom the Nauglamír, the Necklace of the Dwarves. And they set therein the Silmaril which they had found in the hoard of Glaurung, and it shone amid the gold like a red star. Then the",

In the essay, Walker describes how she came upon Hurston’s novel Their Eyes Were Watching God while searching for a black heroine who might serve as a role model for young black women. She found no such heroine in Hurston’s novel, but she did find a woman who was “a good example of what a black woman should not be.” Walker’s essay, which appeared in the midst of the second wave of feminism, helped to revive interest in Hurston’s work. Her novel has been reprinted several times, and her other writings have begun to appear in print. But the revival of interest in Hurston has not yet led to a full appreciation of her work. Although she is often cited as one of the major figures of the Harlem Renaissance, she is rarely discussed in detail.

He was very much like other hobbits, and enjoyed a quiet life, eating second breakfasts every day, smoking his pipe, and drinking ale. One day, however, Gandalf the wizard came to visit, and told Bilbo that he was going to have an adventure. Bilbo did not want one, but Gandalf insisted, and soon Bilbo was off on a journey to the Lonely Mountain, where he met Gollum and discovered a magic ring. From there, Bilbo’s adventures took him all over Middle-earth, and he became a hero of legend. Bilbo Baggins was a hobbit who lived in his hole under the Hill at",

The fairies are not cruel; they are just different. And they are very particular about their rules. You must always say please and thank you, and mind your manners, and never ever laugh at them, because they don't like it.

It is an amusing fact, yet there is I fear some truth in it, that those who brew or bake, though few of them know the reason why, seldom or never have more than one hair on the top of their heads, whereas those who live mainly on green things or on meats have usually more hairs, sometimes a great deal more. This rule seems to be suspected, even by hobbits themselves, for in dress and fashion the two classes are always somewhat opposed. The hair question, however, is quite beyond the scope of my enquiries today.

Viv watched as Meg and Wyatt settled into two straight-back molded plastic seats. It was as if time had stood still here in this small town. The so-called hospital was more like a health clinic straight out of the twentieth century. The reception room was about two hundred square feet, with speckled brown and white linoleum tiles, egg-colored walls half covered with battered oak wainscoting having seen better days decades ago. There was a large bay window in serious need of a good scrubbing, but it at least allowed the morning sun in to brighten the all but otherwise unremarkable room. The adjacent wall donned two faded framed posters, matching alpine scenes, a group of colorfully clad skiers traversing steep, powdered slopes. Both posters seemed to be identical to one another, which Viv found to be a strange decorating choice. The glass overhead dome light put out little illumination, probably because of the inside layer of long-deceased insect parts. In one corner of the room was a water cooler surrounded by flowered Dixie cups. A low Crayola-strewn table held several dogeared coloring books, several Tonka toy trucks, and a lone stuffed rabbit, sans one ear. Staring at nothing in particular, she blinked, then blinked again.

Viv watched as Meg and Wyatt settled into two straight-back molded plastic seats. It was as if time had stood still here in this small town. The so-called hospital was more like a health clinic straight out of the twentieth century. The reception room was about two hundred square feet, with speckled brown and white linoleum tiles, egg-colored walls half covered with battered oak wainscoting having seen better days decades ago. There was a large bay window in serious need of a good scrubbing, but it at least allowed the morning sun in to brighten the all but otherwise unremarkable room. The adjacent wall donned two faded framed posters, matching alpine scenes, a group of colorfully clad skiers traversing steep, powdered slopes. Both posters seemed to be identical to one another, which Viv found to be a strange decorating choice. The glass overhead dome light put out little illumination, probably because of the inside layer of long-deceased insect parts. In one corner of the room was a water cooler surrounded by flowered Dixie cups. A low Crayola-strewn table held several dogeared coloring books, several Tonka toy trucks, and a lone stuffed rabbit, sans one ear. Staring at nothing in particular, she blinked, then blinked again. This wasn’t the first time she’d caught herself. She briefly wondered if it was possible to actually die of boredom. Was there a medical term for that? She moved back behind the reception desk, passed by the closed door of patient room 1. Although muffled, she could hear Grif’s country drawl, the easy, friendly cadence of his voice. Everyone loved Grif. She checked patient room #2—there were only two patient rooms within this facility—making sure everything was ready before she was to escort in one more catastrophic medical emergency: impacted earwax, a sprained ankle, or maybe an\n\n\nComplete the prefix:\nbecame Mrs. Bungo Baggins.

The name stuck though, and people called it Bag End even after the Baggins family had become quite forgotten; and indeed Hobbits remained ignorant of its old name until our own times in the Shire, when Tolman Cotton of Long Cleeve rediscovered a map of the district made in S.R. 1400 showing it as âUndershaftâ. That is the true origin of its present name. Undershaft was the name of the lane leading up to it from the Water; but it was soon corrupted to",

The door opened on to a tube-shaped hall like a tunnel: a very comfortable tunnel without smoke, with panelled walls, and floors tiled and carpeted, provided with polished chairs, and lots and lots of pegs for hats and coats—the hobbit was fond of visitors.

As the car drove away he turned round and walked unsteadily back towards the house. He had never felt so lonely, nor so wretched. His aunt and uncle meant well, but they were stupid and cruel, and everything they did annoyed him! They were only interested in one thing - money and status - and the fact that he couldn't give them either of these things made no difference whatever. Harry knew - because Uncle Vernon had shouted it often enough - that it would have been better off dead than as a burden on the Dursleys. How right he was. Harry sat down on the front step, bent his head over his knees, and began to cry slowly. He had never been so unhappy.

Mrs Dursley was a squinty woman with blonde hair turning grey, Mrs Potter had long black hair so shiny and straight it looked polished. Mrs Dursley liked cats, Mrs Potter dogs. The list of differences was endless, yet Mrs Dursley always spoke of her sister as though she were an embarrassing friend who had done something unfortunate. \"Mrs Potter is the sort of person who just drives past children who are carrying heavy luggage on the motorway,\" she would say. \"She never understands why no one speaks to her!\" Mrs Dursley would watch her sister's every move, ready to pounce on anything strange or unfeminine.

Now, no more talk of dragons!” Harry didn’t answer. He was thinking: Dragons! He’d never really believed they existed until now. He kept remembering the way Hagrid had looked when he talked about them. . . . “And another thing,” said Uncle Vernon, “no more letters to that man, either.” “What man?” said Harry quickly. “That man you’ve been writing to all summer — Grunnmalf, wasn’t it? Grawnpiper? Something like that, anyway.” “Graffalorp,” said Harry. “Professor Graffalorp.” “Well, whatever. No more letters to him, see?

Side by side, they’d backtracked halfway to the mansion. “It’s the prettiest thing I ever seen.” He’d taken off his baseball cap, and his forehead sparkled with sweat. Both of them were drenched, the backs of their T-shirts sticking in the high heat. Bare-handed, not stopping for water, they’d shoveled gravel and raked without pause for the past three hours. “We did it,” Maud said. “Now we get to watch it grow.” “And water it and weed it.” “Yes, that too.” Gabriel came up from his dig to see, and that afternoon Maud brought the girls.

Let’s do dinner together every few nights. Let things evolve naturally.” “Like they have with us,” Gabriel said. “Sort of. Yes.” “But you and I don’t play games,” he said, pointing his knife at her. “And here you’re telling me to play hard to get.” Maud stole a french fry from his plate. “As Ella is quick to point out,” she said, “parents are major hypocrites.” 5 With the laying of this last path, the garden was done. Maud dropped her shovel and walked backward to see. Since planting the final bed of lupine and roses, she and Chris had been emptying wheelbarrow after wheelbarrow of gravel and raking it into a smooth, glistering maze that slipped past one bed to another: irises to coneflowers, primroses to violets. Sweet potato vines spilled from the cast-iron urns under a conflagration of begonias. With its swirls and splashes of color, the garden was more like a brilliant, bold archipelago than the carpet Downing had described. “What do you think?” she asked Chris. Side by side, they’d backtracked halfway to the mansion. “It’s the prettiest thing I ever seen.” He’d taken off his baseball cap, and his forehead sparkled with sweat. Both of them were drenched, the backs of their T-shirts sticking in the high heat. Bare-handed, not stopping for water, they’d shoveled gravel and raked without pause for the past three hours. “We did it,” Maud said. “Now we get to watch it grow.” “And water it and weed it.” “Yes, that too.” Gabriel came up from his dig to see, and that afternoon Maud brought the girls.

'How can I help them catch someone who doesn't want to be caught? And how can I help them catch anyone when I'm stuck here?' 'Ah, well, there's the difficulty,' said Dumbledore, smiling slightly.

He knew he would never be able to return to Hogwarts, but he also knew that he could never go back to Muggle school either. He was stuck between two worlds, neither one of which he belonged in anymore. He tried to focus on the positive aspects of his situation. At least he wouldn’t have to worry about Voldemort anymore.

        "output": " you’re wondering why Harry Potter is so popular, well, there are many reasons. But one reason is that J.K. Rowling created a world where magic is real, and where wizards and witches live among us. In this world, there are many different types of magical creatures, including unicorns, dragons, and mermaids. There are also many different kinds of spells, potions, and charms. And there are many different ways to use magic, such as through wands, brooms, and cauldrons. But perhaps the most important aspect of Harry Potter is its message of hope and friendship. Through the adventures of Harry, Ron, Hermione, and their friends, readers learn that even in the darkest times, there is always hope. They also learn that true friendship is worth fighting for, no matter what obstacles stand in your way. So if you’re looking for a story that will transport you to a world of wonder and adventure, look no further than Harry Potter. You won’t regret",

He had shouted at the fireplace, demanding to know why he couldn't stay where he belonged, with people who loved him, rather than being exiled once more to the house of his unworthy relatives. But now he realised that Dumbledore had known what he was doing. His hand strayed to his neck, and he touched the chain around it, feeling the small golden locket hanging from it.

He’d never seen a Shrinking Potion before, but he knew that if you put some into a cauldron full of water, the water would shrink down to the size of a pea. If you added more potion, the water would shrink even further, until it was the size of a pinhead. Then it would disappear altogether. Harry had tried to imagine what it would feel like to drink a potion that shrank you down to the size of a pea. Or a pinhead. Or nothing at all. He thought it might be quite nice, actually.

She wants to ask him questions, to spill stories from him and know what lies behind that troubled face. But she doubts he would talk. A man like him probably hasn’t talked in his entire life. She imagines his thoughts crawling inside him, like worms in the earth, doomed to stay in the shadows. Helen would have charmed him with her beauty and subtle cleverness, softening him until he opened like a peach. Castor would have mocked him, pricked him with words like needles until he talked.

He wanted to be normal, and if being normal meant being bullied by Draco Malfoy and his friends, then so be it. It wasn't until the end of his first year at Hogwarts that Harry realized just how much he'd been missing out on. That's when he met Hermione Granger, a Muggle-born witch who was determined to help him understand his magical heritage. Together, they set out to uncover the truth about Voldemort's rise to power and defeat him once and for all. Along the way, they made some unlikely allies, including Ron Weasley, a Gryffindor boy who was always ready to lend a hand. With their combined strength, they were able to overcome even the most daunting obstacles and emerge victorious.

It was almost as if he was using the negative energy to fuel his own power. As the years went on, Harry became more and more powerful. He started to develop abilities that even the most experienced wizards had never seen before. His powers were so great that he was eventually able to escape from Hogwarts and start his own school for young witches and wizards. There, he taught them how to use their magic in ways that were both creative and destructive. And while some might argue that Harry's methods were too extreme, there is no denying that he changed the course of wizardry forever. Today, many people still study his teachings and strive to become as powerful as he was. But perhaps the greatest legacy of Harry Potter is the hope that he gave to those who felt powerless.

His teachers liked him—and indeed his classmates liked him well enough—but they didn't understand him, and of course they laughed at him. They were all of them big, hearty boys, and used to doing whatever they wanted to do. And they all thought there must be something funny about little Georgie's shyness. So they teased him unmercifully, and called him names behind his back. But Georgie never answered back; he simply kept his head down and went on being shy. When he grew older, he left school and got a job in a shop. There he met a girl who fell in love with him. But she was very pretty, and lots of other men also loved her. So she married one",

His word was enough for his twelve men and maids, his twenty-two children and grandchildren. But he never acted without consulting them. He was firm, but he was gentle. He took no notice of complaints and he demanded little personal attention. When on parties he gave everyone a share of the lead, and everyone felt it was a great honour to walk beside him. It must have been a comfortable life in those days, and Bilbo enjoyed it to the full. I don't know how long exactly it lasted: the story does not concern it, nor would it be of general interest if it did, but I suppose a hundred years",

By December, I’d written my second, My Girlfriend Never Farts, which was a digital short that interspersed men at a bachelor party remarking on how their girlfriends and wives always smelled great and were hairless interspersed with shots of the women grunting and sweating as they moved a couch up a staircase, writhing on the toilet with explosive diarrhea, and giving instructions to an aesthetician who was waxing their buttholes.

A few years after not reciprocating my feelings, Elliot appeared to develop an almost identical friendship with another new female writer except that I had the impression they were hooking up, but it didn’t last.
