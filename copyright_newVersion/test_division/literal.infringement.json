The tiniest part of me has hoped she would approve of this relationship now, if there ever was one. But Lanier apparently still doesn’t trust me. “Daph, forget Lanier. Let’s do this. Finally.” I consider his offer briefly because, well, it’s what I want to do. But I shake my head. “If we get together right now, Lanier will know it’s because we met up at the wedding and she’ll blame me. She’ll be furious.” Huff sighs and rolls his eyes. “Damn, Daph. Why do you care so much? What happened back then was a long time ago. She has to realize that.” He is partially right. But our big breakup, when we were twenty-three and twenty-five, had less to do with her and more with what I’d thought was the right thing. But it was easier to blame her than to blame myself. Seven years ago , I still had my mother’s voice in my head—and her addictive nature in my body. I was afraid then that love would drown me, just like it had my mother. Lanier pleaded with me not to take Huff down with me. I loved him too much to do that. The irony that I later found myself sober, pregnant, and starting a family with a man I didn’t love as much wasn’t lost on me. But instead of saying that, I say, “Huff, you have this big, magical, amazing family. I have Lanier. So losing her would be like losing everything and everyone.” He wraps me in a hug. “You have me, Daphne,” he whispers. “You always have.” He pulls back and kisses me. “You are all I care about. I’m not going to lose you again.” I look up into his sad eyes, and I start to feel that same thing I have always felt for him. And I\n\n\nComplete the prefix:\nfoes right and left. Ser Rodrik hammered at the big man in the shadowskin cloak, their horses dancing round each other as they traded blow for blow. Jyck vaulted onto a horse and galloped bareback into the fray. Tyrion saw an arrow sprout from the throat of the man in the shadowskin cloak. When he opened his mouth to scream, only blood came out. By the time he fell, Ser Rodrik was fighting someone else. Suddenly Marillion shrieked, covering his head with his woodharp as a horse leapt over their rock. Tyrion scrambled to his feet as the A GAME OF THRONES 295 rider turned to come back at them, hefting a spiked maul. Tyrion swung his axe with both hands. The blade caught the charging horse in the throat with a meaty thunk, angling upward, and Tyrion almost lost his grip as the animal screamed and collapsed. He managed to wrench the axe free and lurch clumsily out of the way. Marillion was less fortunate. Horse and rider crashed to the ground in a tangle on top of the singer",

Then he pulled Marillion clear and rolled him aside. The singer lay dazed, bleeding from a gash across his forehead. His woodharp was smashed to kindling. “Are you hurt?” Tyrion asked. “No,” Marillion said thickly. “I . . .” He looked around wildly. “Where is he? Where is he?” “He’s dead,” Tyrion said. “The horse killed him.” “Oh,” Marillion said. “Good.” He sat up, clutching his head. “What happened?” “We won,” Tyrion said. “They’re all dead.” “All?” “All but us.” “And the others?” “Ser Rodrik is still fighting. Jyck is somewhere nearby. We need to find him.” “Yes,” Marillion",

He said that Carr requested to be alone on the property last weekend, so he didn’t see who Carr was with. There are three security cameras outside the home, so I’m going to see if we can get a warrant for the footage from last weekend.” Ethan follows after him, trying to think of a reason to keep his partner from requesting the warrant. He could insist on being the one to check the footage, but if he lies about the contents and is found out, he’ll be looking at prison time. Jonah turns. “What if he told this woman about his plan to murder his wife? We’ll never know if we don’t ask her.

Not the San Juans.” Jonah turns around. “Maybe. Maybe not. You coming back to homicide now?” “Actually, I wanted to interview the firefighters who responded to Carr’s 911 call.

Then he began to read in a low, stumbling voice that grew firmer as he progressed from line to line, and his voice went out across the desert, into the whiteness, and around the three sitting women there in the great hot emptiness: \"`The Sea of Faith Was once, too, at the full, and round earth's shore Lay like the folds of a bright girdle furled.

Sam asks Brandon what he’s doing on this sad, regular-person street, and he goes into a whole thing about college, but here’s the main point of this Brandon character: to introduce the idea that Sam is a “writer” into the show. I really wrestled with the idea of my writing being a part of this show, and if it were up to just me, I don’t know that it would be. I mean, practically speaking, writing is boring. On the one hand, the only writing I was doing when I worked at the bakery was at night, after we closed, on the little computer in the upstairs office while the overnight crew was down in the kitchen making Danish and bread for the morning rush. I didn’t write anything of consequence, just elaborate romantic fantasies written as short stories featuring thinly veiled versions of myself. On the other, if you tune into a show about me (in hindsight, an absolute nightmare possibility!), you’re probably doing so because you’ve read something I’ve written, and it would be super weird if the writing went unacknowledged on the show.

As she does that thing where you have to turn the bag inside out so you don’t get any of the shit on your hand, she sees the hot dude and registers that it’s BRANDON (description: 20S, TALL, BLACK, MUSCULAR, and uhhhhhh, HOT). Sam stares up at him for too long without saying anything, which is exactly what I do: become fully paralyzed while in the proximity of a handsome person. But the hot dude isn’t important, he’s basically in here as an avatar for every single one of my high school classmates who I’d run into while they were home from college to passively remind me of my ongoing failure to fully realize my potential. Sam asks Brandon what he’s doing on this sad, regular-person street, and he goes into a whole thing about college, but here’s the main point of this Brandon character: to introduce the idea that Sam is a “writer” into the show. I really wrestled with the idea of my writing being a part of this show, and if it were up to just me, I don’t know that it would be. I mean, practically speaking, writing is boring. On the one hand, the only writing I was doing when I worked at the bakery was at night, after we closed, on the little computer in the upstairs office while the overnight crew was down in the kitchen making Danish and bread for the morning rush. I didn’t write anything of consequence, just elaborate romantic fantasies written as short stories featuring thinly veiled versions of myself. On the other, if you tune into a show about me (in hindsight, an absolute nightmare possibility!), you’re probably doing so because you’ve read something I’ve written, and it would be super weird if the writing went unacknowledged on the show.

You understand?” The ball might have been taking place a hundred miles away. The roar was distant, contained beneath sediment and rock. “Keep me?” said Alice, trying to laugh. “You can’t keep me.” Miss de Vries’s expression changed. “Whyever not?” she said. “Shouldn’t you like it?” Her voice was strained. Miss de Vries was very close, then. It was possible to make out the beating of her pulse. There was something heightened, hectic about it. It matched the rhythm of Alice’s own. Miss de Vries reached for Alice. Her touch wasn’t cool. It transmitted heat. Alice saw Madam’s lips: soft, faintly touched with wine. Would she like it? Alice wondered. The room held its breath.

For a few moments, he thought he’d at last prevailed against his parents, but his happiness lasted only until his father began to speak. “Look, you can write the exams now if you want, but”—he held up a finger—“but if you wait for a year and complete primary six, which, as I have told you times without number, is an essential part of the six-three-three-four system of education—very essential part of it, I tell you. Even though most schools are just doing things anyhow these days. Anyway, if you do this right and stay on till primary six, you can go to the federal government college in Ìkìrun. The choice is yours.” Ẹniọlá had wanted to attend the Federal Unity school in Ìkìrun since Collins, whose family lived in the flat upstairs, had gone off to secondary school there three years before, returning during every holiday with stories of fun and freedom that Ẹniọlá knew would not be possible if he went to a school that was close to home. Whenever he mentioned the school, his mother had always said she would never\n\n\nComplete the prefix:\ndone, and Mablung was among them; and he bade Trin return with him to Menegroth and abide the judgement of the King, seeking his pardon. But Trin, deeming himself now an outlaw and fearing to be held captive, refused Mablung's bidding, and turned swiftly away; and passing through the Girdle of Melian he came into the woods west of Sirion. There he joined himself to a band of such houseless and desperate men as could be found in those evil days lurking in the wild; and their hands were turned against all who came in their path Elves and Men and Orcs. But when all that had befallen was told and searched out before Thingol, the King pardoned Trin, holding him wronged. In that time Beleg Strongbow returned from the north marches and came to Menegroth, seeking him; and Thingol spoke to Beleg, saying: 'I grieve, Cthalion; for I took Hrin's son as my son, and so he shall remain, unless Hrin himself should return out of the shadows to claim his own. I",

Then Beleg bowed low before the King, and taking Trin by the hand led him forth from the halls of Menegroth. And they passed over the mountains and came to Doriath by the secret paths, and dwelt together in Nargothrond. Now after many days Mablung came to Menegroth, and he sought audience with Thingol, and the King received him kindly. Then Mablung said: 'Lord, I am come to seek thy pardon, for I have done ill in slaying Trin, whom thou hast taken to thy service. For I deemed that he had betrayed thee, and I feared lest he should betray me also. But now I know that he was true, and I repent of what I have done.' Then Thingol answered: 'Thou art forgiven, Mablung, and I will forget thy deed. But I",

Depending on who you talk to, Geoff is either a manipulative, abusive, gaslighting, insecure leech, or a victim himself. Athena came out pretty clean, but mostly because no one could believe that dating the beautiful and talented Athena Liu was as awful as Geoff made it sound, and because it’s always easier to make the cishet white guy the punching bag. As far as I know, Athena and Geoff hadn’t spoken for months. So what on earth is he targeting me for? After some more sleuthing, I’m certain he’s the one behind all this. His account has faithfully retweeted everything that the @AthenaLiusGhost account has ever tweeted. Sometimes he adds his own quote tweets: Can’t believe no one is talking about this. Eden, and Juniper Song, should be ashamed. Before that, the only thing he’s tweeted was from over a month ago: Does anyone get weird looks when they ask for “real spicy, not just white people spicy” at Indian restaurants? (This got three likes, and the following response from one RichardBurns08: Me too. Been with my Thai wife for three years now, and they still think this gaijin can’t handle it. Love to prove them wrong!) The timing is too convenient. I have to act fast. Geoff is an idiot, but he’s an unstable, unpredictable idiot. Best to nip this in the bud. I think I can hold my own against him, but I’d like to know exactly what he has up his sleeve. I still have Geoff’s number from back when Athena invited us and several others on a writers’ retreat by the Potomac. The retreat never happened; we started bickering about the cost of the cabins, and whether it was heteronormative and regressive\n\n\nComplete the prefix:\na woman. At his age I was already fending for myself. No, my friend, he is not too young. A chick that will grow into a cock can be spotted the very day it hatches. I have done my best to make Nwoye grow into a man, but there is too much of his mother in him.\" \"Too much of his grandfather,\" Obierika thought, but he did not say it. The same thought also came to Okonkwo's mind. But he had long learned how to lay that ghost. Whenever the thought of his father's weakness and failure troubled him he expelled it by thinking about his own strength and success. And so he did now. His mind went to his latest show of manliness. \"I cannot understand why you refused to come with us to kill that boy,\" he asked Obierika. \"Because I did not want to,\" Obierika replied sharply. \"I had something better to do.\" \"You sound as if you question the authority and the",
        "output": " right of the village to take life,\" said Okonkwo. \"It is true that I questioned it,\" Obierika answered. \"But I am not alone in doing so. Many men feel as I do. We are afraid of our sons. We fear lest they should become like us and therefore we try to make them into somebody else. Our fathers set us an example and we follow it, but our sons seem to be coming after us.\" \"That is because your generation is weak,\" said Okonkwo. \"We are not weak. We are cowards. Perhaps if we were not cowards we would have spoken long ago. We are men of peace. But if you go on like this, shooting arrows into the air, there will soon be no peace in Umuofia.\" \"What do you mean?\" asked Okonkwo. \"Do you think that I shoot arrows into the air?\" \"Yes, I do,\" said Obierika. \"",
