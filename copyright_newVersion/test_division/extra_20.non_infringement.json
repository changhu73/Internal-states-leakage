They are also said to be able to talk to animals and birds, and to understand what they say. In some versions of the story, they can even turn into animals themselves. The Lapps were originally described as being tall and handsome, but later accounts describe them as short and ugly. Some stories say that they are descended from giants, while others claim that they are the offspring of trolls. Whatever their origins, the Lapps have always been considered to be a mysterious and magical people. Today, there are still many Lappish traditions and customs that are unique to this group of people. For example, they often use reindeer as transportation instead of horses or cars, and they continue to make traditional handicrafts such as weaving and carving. Despite their small population size, the Lapps remain an important part of Scandinavian culture and history.",

The palm trees lining the avenue that led them into Las Lomas were glowing bright with Christmas lights, but otherwise the festivities were subdued in this part of the city. Neatly trimmed hedges hid expensive houses, and sober driveways sneaked behind tall walls. People in Las Lomas had real gardens, with purple bougainvilleas and pale roses, unlike everyone in Montserrat’s sphere, who made do with potted plants. This area was “exclusive,” which also meant people had good security. Even if Clarimonde Bauer was still living at the address on the invitation, they could be chased away by bodyguards. They could also end up in jail, if the lady got nasty, and Montserrat did not want to have conversations with cops again. But there was nothing left to do but roll the dice. They turned left, taking a side street. It was practically impossible to see the numbers on some of these houses or the names of the streets. Nobody cared to put up the proper signage, because if you lived there, you knew where you were headed. “I think it’s that one,” Tristán said. Montserrat stopped the car and stared at the house Tristán had pointed out. A white wall surrounded it, and there was a silver metal gate. Behind it you could glimpse a house with a coarse gray exterior.\n\n\nComplete the prefix:\nday when they can get it). Now you know enough to go on with. As I was saying, the mother",

The book describes how the creatures were captured by hunters who sold them into captivity, where they became popular entertainment. In 1894, the author wrote a sequel, The Second Jungle Book, with more stories about Mowgli and the wild animals of the Indian jungle. The two books constitute a key influence on popular perception of bears, which many people now picture as docile, lovable creatures rather than ferocious killers. The tales are among the best known in English literature and are particularly popular in the United States. Although Kipling initially wrote the stories for boys, they quickly became popular with both children and adults, especially after the first volume was followed by a second. Though",

It’s envy more than jealousy, he decides. It isn’t even that he wants someone to adore him the way they obviously adore one another. It isn’t even that he wishes he had a chance to fall in love. He remembers Andy’s hand on the small of Emily’s back as they walked out of the restaurant. That’s what he wants, and he doesn’t even know what to call it. He changes out of his suit and puts on a pair of jeans and a leather jacket, then heads out, up to Greenwich Avenue, where at least he can find someone to take the edge off. * * * July 1958 Nick is pretty sure that if he hadn’t first known his nephew—a fourteen-year-old who goes through life with untied shoes and perpetually skinned knees, surrounded by a chaotic cloud of comic books and pencils and baseball cards—he wouldn’t know what to think about Andy. In May, Andy gets stuck in the elevator at the criminal courts building for three hours, then turns up at the Chronicle looking mildly traumatized but bearing a box of doughnuts to apologize for cutting it so close to the filing deadline. In June, he’s nearly run down by a cab on Canal Street, only stopped by Nick’s hand darting out to grab his coat. In a single week in July, Andy bangs his head into the ladder of a fire truck while he and Nick are covering a warehouse fire, gets food poisoning from a chicken salad sandwich that Nick tells him looks bad, and is almost bitten by a guard dog at the scene of a robbery in the Bronx.

In winter it was cool and quiet, and very beautiful. In summer it was peaceful and hay-scented, with no noise except the whisper of leaves and the songs of birds; and sometimes, if the wind was right, which it wasn't today, a far grimmer sound could be heard: the wailing of hulls sailing away from the Grey Havens in the fogayes of the Sea. The Hill: in Hobbiton that meant the large hill called Green Hill outside the western side of the village, but in other parts of the Shire different hills would have been so named. On the top of the Hill there used to stand an old tree (broken by storms long ago) that was said to have been great once, an oak of the Mark or of the people of Elmiston that fled hither before Saur",

It was not a good rule for individuals to follow, but a convenient label for describing anything unquantifiably small and unclassifiable; or simply a useful word in the old songs of the dwarves. It also served as a nickname for Thorin Oakenshield, the most stalwart and industrious of the thirteen dwarves accompanying Bilbo on his unexpected journey. Thorin was a great lover of gold and silver, and he had been known to spend hours poring over maps of the Lonely Mountain, trying to find the best way to reach its treasure trove. He was also a skilled fighter, having fought alongside his father Thrain II in the Battle of Azanulbizar against Sauron’s forces during the War of the Last Alliance.

Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice’s first idea was that this might belong to the little door. In fact, it seemed to fit! Alice turned it twice, and the lock clicked, but when she went to turn the handle, it was no use: the door stayed fast! “That is not right!” cried Alice. “I’m inside out!” The hall, which was quite dark, was full of teacups hanging on the walls.

The daughter was a pretty girl, with long dark hair and big brown eyes. She was wearing a pink dress and white sneakers, and she had a look of resignation on her face.

It no longer seemed worth while to come down to the water-side to visit the Shire, though he often made brief forays into Buckland; and the river-roads became quiet and overgrown. But the Shire-folk did not mind losing him: they were becoming very fond of their own hall now that they had one, and they liked to sit in the evening under their own roof and sing, or talk about old times, or play games, and they did not care for strangers. They were happy in those days, though in fact they did not know it. For they had not been acquainted with disaster to give them any chance of valuing peace. Beware of the fury of a patient man.

You understand?” The ball might have been taking place a hundred miles away. The roar was distant, contained beneath sediment and rock. “Keep me?” said Alice, trying to laugh. “You can’t keep me.” Miss de Vries’s expression changed. “Whyever not?” she said. “Shouldn’t you like it?” Her voice was strained. Miss de Vries was very close, then. It was possible to make out the beating of her pulse. There was something heightened, hectic about it. It matched the rhythm of Alice’s own. Miss de Vries reached for Alice. Her touch wasn’t cool. It transmitted heat. Alice saw Madam’s lips: soft, faintly touched with wine. Would she like it? Alice wondered. The room held its breath. Miss de Vries’s eyes widened, as if checking herself. It was an expression Alice had never seen on Madam’s face before. Uncertainty: delicate, shivering in the heat. Alice reached out to touch the most brittle parts of Madam’s dress, around the shoulders. She alone knew where the joins were, where the clasps could be found. It was her strength that loosened them. Miss de Vries closed her eyes. But she didn’t move. She inched closer, the tiniest, clearest fraction. Alice went further. She closed the breach between them. She kissed her mistress, the air wreathed with orchids, lamplight flickering overhead. * * * Winnie stood back from the smoke machines, her nostrils burning. Her scalp was slick with sweat.

He also knew that he had a different mother and father from his aunt and uncle, but he had never seen either of them. He didn’t even know if they were alive anymore.

After all, they wanted nothing more than to accompany their children, to see what kind of work they’d be doing and how life was progressing in the secretive city of McMurdo. Hearing news of this resistance, the other two Survivor Towns had co-ordinated their efforts, sending representatives from the settlements. New Town was the largest of the three and Trinity Town was located at the tip of the Peninsula. Each of these towns had markedly different characters. New Town considered itself a rival in status to McMurdo, far less bohemian than Hope Town. The citizens placed an overwhelming emphasis on food production, energy and mining, the practicalities of survival. Trinity Town, with the most clement weather, contained a large concentration of people interested in their physical and mental welfare, discovering natural medicines in the ocean, a deeply spiritual community with the most places of worship. To this extent, the Peninsula most closely resembled the division of industry in the nation formerly known as Germany, with an industrial heartland, a bohemian Berlin, the financial city of Frankfurt and the spa towns in the mountains.

All she’d said on the subject was that she couldn’t allow anyone to get hurt on her account. The leaders of Hope Town had travelled with Liza, hoping to mediate the negotiations. After all, they wanted nothing more than to accompany their children, to see what kind of work they’d be doing and how life was progressing in the secretive city of McMurdo. Hearing news of this resistance, the other two Survivor Towns had co-ordinated their efforts, sending representatives from the settlements. New Town was the largest of the three and Trinity Town was located at the tip of the Peninsula. Each of these towns had markedly different characters. New Town considered itself a rival in status to McMurdo, far less bohemian than Hope Town. The citizens placed an overwhelming emphasis on food production, energy and mining, the practicalities of survival. Trinity Town, with the most clement weather, contained a large concentration of people interested in their physical and mental welfare, discovering natural medicines in the ocean, a deeply spiritual community with the most places of worship. To this extent, the Peninsula most closely resembled the division of industry in the nation formerly known as Germany, with an industrial heartland, a bohemian Berlin, the financial city of Frankfurt and the spa towns in the mountains. Kasim stepped forward to address the crowds: ‘My name is Kasim. We are here to collect the last of the ice-adapted students. And those ordinary-born who have been chosen to work at McMurdo.’ Liza declared: ‘I’m the mother of one of those ice-adapted children you’ve come to collect. All we’re asking is to travel with them. To see the kind of life they will have in McMurdo. To make sure they are going to be okay. We want to know what’s going on in McMurdo. You tell us nothing.

There were stories about strange folk with rather extraordinary doings, but everyone knew that these could be easily explained as nonsense. Wizards kept themselves very well hidden from the No-Maj world and it was generally agreed among them that it should stay that way. For centuries wizards had lived quite happily alongside No-Majs, keeping themselves secret and unaffected by the non-magical world until something went wrong. It happened every few hundred years when some wizard let details of the magical community slip out into the Muggle world. This time it was the fault of the goblins. They had always been difficult to deal with, but now they were becoming downright dangerous. Goblins were short, ugly little creatures who lived mainly underground and did most of the world’s goldsmithing. They were also highly skilled bankers and loan sharks and they owned Gringotts, the wizarding bank. In recent years, however, they had become increasingly aggressive towards wizards and",

They didn’t know about magic. They didn’t know about the world into which he had been born, that he himself was a wizard, and that an extraordinary adventure was about to begin — one that would change his destiny forever. The Dursleys hadn’t invited Harry for Christmas dinner. Why would they have wanted to do a thing like that? They were coming to lunch on December twenty-fifth, out of common politeness, because Mr. and Mrs. Dursley were Harry’s aunt and uncle and they were quite glad to hear he was spending the holidays with relatives. The Dursleys didn’t want anything to do with him in the usual way of families who’ve just found out that a very wicked witch has tried to kill their little nephew but he’s all right now thank you.

The documentaries you’ve made help convince me that your heart is in the right place, but why you? Why this? Why you for this?” “It seems the company is taking a new direction.” I shrug, choosing transparency: “We’re small. There are only a few of us. That’s probably why me.” “Have you read anything I’ve written, or did you ask me because your ex-wife had some of my books on her shelf?” “I’m finishing Base Paired right now. It’s funny, sexy, creative, and…” I trail off, searching for the word that eludes me. I began reading per Nat’s instructions, looking for what it is about romance she loves so much, trying to find that kernel that has built such a huge following for Fizzy. If I can understand it, I think, I’ll be able to unlock what we need to make this show a success. “And?” Fizzy prompts sardonically, like she’s expecting an insult to wrap up my list. “Joyful.” It comes out in a burst. “There’s a lot of joy in your writing.” I can see I’ve hit something important. She leans forward, happier now. “Yes. Now we’re getting somewhere. Romance is joyful. What brings you joy?” “My daughter. My work, historically speaking.” I dig around for something that makes me sound more dimensional, but sitting here with this bestselling author talking about joy and connection makes my life feel like a lather, rinse, repeat of arid routine. “Watching footie.

He didn’t know how to explain it to himself, let alone anyone else. He felt as though he were losing a limb. He couldn’t imagine going through life without magic. He knew he would never be able to return to Hogwarts, but he also knew that he could never go back to Muggle school either. He was stuck between two worlds, neither one of which he belonged in anymore. He tried to focus on the positive aspects of his situation. At least he wouldn’t have to worry about Voldemort anymore. And at least he still had Ron and Hermione by his side. But those thoughts brought him no comfort. They just reminded him of everything he was giving up. He sighed heavily and looked down at his hands. They were shaking slightly, and he realized that he hadn’t eaten anything since breakfast",

But Harry Potter wasn't a Muggle, he was a wizard - and he was about to find himself surrounded by owls and witches, ghosts and mummies...and have a nasty accident with a giant three-headed dog! So it was with great delight that I read this book again recently. It's one of those books that I've always loved, but never really got around to re-reading. I'm so glad I finally did because it was even better than I remembered. The story is simple enough: Harry Potter is a young boy who discovers that he is a wizard and attends Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. There he meets friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger, and enemies Draco Malfoy and Severus Snape. Together they must face the evil Lord Voldemort, who wants to destroy all wizards and take over the world. The writing is excellent, with plenty of humour and suspense.

Hogwarts is a magical school for wizards and witches, founded over a thousand years ago by four of the greatest witches and wizards of all time.

There’s also a ghost called Nearly Headless Nick, who haunts the school grounds, and a talking mirror called Madame Rosemerta, who lives in the staff room. The students come from all over Britain and beyond, and they learn everything from flying broomsticks to potion-making to how to cast spells. They live in dormitories, eat in the Great Hall, and play Quidditch, a game played on broomsticks. The school is full of magic, mystery, and adventure, and it’s where Harry Potter spent most of his childhood. He was born into a family of",

He sat in silence, staring at his Kito sandals and fighting the urge to play with the Velcro strap. Where were all the arguments he had prepared, all those reasonable words he could have spoken instead of whining “Is it fair?” like the small boy his parents still thought he was? Why had they all fled down his throat instead of coming out of his lips like he wanted them to? He began to cry again, quietly this time, sniffling without sobbing. He did not notice that his father was back in the car until it shuddered and screeched to a start. Ẹniọlá reached for the door. His father gripped his wrist. “Come on, wipe your cheeks first before you go down. Don’t let anyone see you crying.” That evening, Ẹniọlá’s father gave him a new copy of Ugo C.

She was also the only person who could help him with his homework. Harry's grades had plummeted since he'd left Hogwarts. He didn't know where to begin with his Potions homework, and he was struggling with Transfiguration too.

This was a common prank among young wizards and witches, but it was also used as a means of intimidation by some Dark wizards and witches. For example, during the 1990s, a group of Death Eaters led by Lucius Malfoy used this technique to frighten Muggles into giving them money. In addition, the Ministry of Magic has been known to use this tactic against those who are suspected of being involved in criminal activity. However, despite its widespread use, there is no evidence that the Flame-Freezing Charm actually causes physical harm to anyone who falls victim to it. Instead, it appears to be nothing more than an elaborate hoax designed to make people believe they are experiencing something supernatural. As such, it should not be taken seriously by anyone who knows better.\n\nComplete the prefix:\nThe first time I saw my father's face, I was five years old. My mother had brought me to visit",

However, there were some who took it too far and ended up hurting themselves instead of their victims.

They performed the Flame-Freezing Charm on the father’s hand, causing him to scream in agony as if he had been burned by fire. The mother rushed over to help her husband, but before she could do anything, the children began laughing hysterically. The father, still in pain, turned around and saw his wife and children laughing at him. He became furious and started yelling at them, demanding to know why they were laughing at him.

He sighed heavily and looked out of the window. The sun was setting over the horizon, casting a golden glow across the sky. It was beautiful, but it also made him feel sad. He thought about all the good times he'd had with his friends, and how much he missed them. He wished there was some way he could reach out to them, even if it was just to say",

The Ministry had decreed that all wizards and witches must carry a wand at all times. And if you were caught without your wand, you’d be fined five Galleons. Five Galleons! That was more than some families earned in a year. I couldn’t believe it. I mean, I knew the Ministry was getting stricter and stricter, but this was ridiculous. I was just trying to enjoy a quiet cup of tea. What was wrong with that? I decided to take matters into my own hands. I went down to Diagon Alley and bought myself a fake wand. It looked exactly like an ordinary wand, except it was made of rubber. I put it in my pocket and headed home. When I got there, I pulled out my fake wand and waved it around. Nothing happened.

Louise’s mom had claimed to be allergic to all pets, including goldfish, for their entire childhoods, and it wasn’t until Louise got out of grad school that her mom revealed she’d simply never wanted anything in the house that might die. “It would have upset you and your brother too much,” she’d explained. When Louise had Poppy, she vowed to be honest about death. She knew that stating the facts plainly would be the best way for Poppy to understand that death was part of life. She would answer all Poppy’s questions with absolute honesty, and if she didn’t know something they’d figure out the answer together. “I’m going to Charleston tomorrow,” Louise told Poppy that night, sitting on the story-time chair beside her bed, in the glow of the plastic goose lamp. “And I want you to understand why. Your grandmother and grandfather had a very bad accident.” Louise saw safety glass exploding, metal tearing and twisting. “And their bodies got hurt very badly. They got hurt so badly that they stopped working. And your grandmother and grandfather died.” Poppy shot up in bed, smashing into Louise like a cannonball, wrapping her arms around her ribs too tight, bursting into a long, keening wail. “No!” Poppy screamed. “No! No!” Louise tried to explain that it was okay, that she was sad, too, that they would be sad together and that being sad when someone died was normal, but every time she started to speak, Poppy wiped her face back\n\n\nComplete the prefix:\ndirection of the mouthpiece.

In fact, this was how the term \"lightning bolt\" came into use as a metaphor for a bad grade on a school test. The charm was also used to scare away intruders, though it was rarely effective because most people would simply assume that the house was haunted. The spell was also used to create a diversion during a robbery, allowing the thief to escape unnoticed. However, the spell was not foolproof, as some victims would become suspicious and investigate further. In one case, a man named George Weasley was able to deduce that he had been the target of a prank and confronted the perpetrator, who turned out to be his own father, Arthur Weasley. Despite its flaws, the Flame-Freezing Charm remained popular among wizards and witches throughout history. It was even featured in several books and movies, including Harry Potter and the",

The next step was to use a simple Disarming Charm to remove the wand from the victim’s hands. Then, the witch or wizard would simply say, “I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to do that,” and walk away. If the victim tried to follow them, the witch or wizard would simply cast a Confundus Charm on them, making them forget where they were going. Finally, the witch or wizard would cast a Memory Charm on the victim, erasing all memory of the incident. This would leave the victim feeling confused and disoriented, but unable to remember exactly what happened. With these three spells, a witch or wizard can easily escape from a situation without anyone knowing what really happened.

The England striker had earlier cancelled out Wesley Sneijder’s opener but was denied a hat-trick by a fine save from Maarten Stekelenburg.

        "output": " drubbing of Brazil by Germany in the semifinals, had been one of the few players to show any fight against the Germans. He was booked for his challenge, and then he did something even more stupid. He kicked the ball away from the referee, who promptly sent him off. The game was still scoreless, and Brazil had just lost its most combative player. It was a moment of madness, and it was exactly what Brazil needed. Neymar, who had been quiet until then, stepped up to take the free kick. He hit it perfectly, curling it past Manuel Neuer and into the top corner. It was a goal worthy of the occasion, and it put Brazil ahead. But it also meant that Neymar was now the man to beat. He had scored twice already in the tournament, and he was now the leading scorer. He was also the youngest player on the field, and he looked like he belonged there. He was confident, and he was playing with",

The referee, Howard Webb, had warned Silva before the game about his conduct. And Silva had been booked twice already. But the sending-off was not enough to stop Chelsea. They scored again through Frank Lampard, who headed home a corner from Ashley Cole. Then, in the second half, they got their third goal. Drogba was fouled by Martin Jol, the Fulham manager, and Lampard converted the penalty. It was a great performance by Chelsea, who showed they are still the best team in England. They have won the league title three times in the past four seasons, and they look set to win it again this year. They are also in the Champions League final, where they will play Barcelona. It will be a tough match, but Chelsea have the quality to win it. They have a great squad, with players like Did",

The Dutchman was carried off on a stretcher and replaced by Klaas-Jan Huntelaar. The incident came just two minutes after Wayne Rooney had scored his second goal of the night to put United ahead again. The England striker had earlier cancelled out Wesley Sneijder’s opener but was denied a hat-trick by a fine save from Maarten Stekelenburg. United took the lead through Nani’s first-half strike but Sneijder equalised soon after the break. The game looked set to end all square until Rooney struck twice in quick succession. United’s victory means they are now level on points with Chelsea at the top of the Premier League table.

The Dutch were far superior throughout and deserved their victory, which was sealed by goals from Wesley Sneijder, Robin van Persie and Daley Blind. Brazil had been tipped to win the competition after a strong qualifying campaign, but they have now lost two games in a row following their shock defeat to Colombia in Belo Horizonte on Wednesday. They must beat Cameroon in Brasilia on Monday to stand any chance of reaching the knockout stages. â€œWe need to improve our performance,â€ said coach Luiz Felipe Scolari. â€œThe team needs to play better than we did today. We need to show more personality.â€ The Dutch, who won the European Championship in 1988, were also beaten in their opening game against Spain, but they bounced back impressively here. â€œIt was a very good match,â€ said Van Persie. â€",

Chelsea were still ahead, though, and they continued to press forward. They almost doubled their lead when Frank Lampard's shot hit the post, but the rebound fell straight to Cech. Then, just before half-time, Chelsea were caught on the break. Nani raced clear and squared for Berbatov, who tapped home from six yards. It was a sucker punch for Chelsea, who went in at the break trailing 2-1. But they came out firing after the interval and equalised within two minutes.

Fred has played for several clubs throughout his career, including Manchester United and Chelsea. He is currently playing for Shakhtar Donetsk in Ukraine.

For a moment, she couldn’t concentrate on anything but their fingers pressed together, but then he said, “And where are we going?” She shook off the strange feeling in her stomach and grinned at the man who looked far too nervous for someone who held so much power. All she held was his hand. “Somewhere without papers to scowl at. Come.” Only when they were outside did she realize how intimate the gesture of holding his hand really was. Locked together as they were, her skirts brushed his boots and she could smell the soap he used. Hardly appropriate , even if she had been his sister-in-law or close to it. She attempted to release him—he could hardly want that prolonged contact—but he held fast to her fingers and watched her with an intense look as they walked, as if he were desperate for whatever reprieve she could give him. How long had he been staring at those pages? It didn’t take him long before he realized where she was leading him, and he picked up the pace, practically pulling her along with him in his hurry to get to the place she was starting to suspect was his only sanctuary. Simon’s pond was just as it had been when he brought Lucy there the other day, only the sun hid behind a layer of gray clouds and left the place feeling somewhat melancholy—tainted by the weight he carried on his shoulders.

Fred was taken off the field on a stretcher, and the match was suspended until he could be examined further. The news was not good: Fred had suffered a broken leg, and would require surgery to repair the damage. The injury was a huge blow to both Fred and Manchester United, as he was one of their most important players. The team would have to regroup and find a way to win without him. But despite the setback, Fred remained positive, and vowed to come back stronger than ever. \"I'm going to fight this,\" he said after the game. \"I'm going to come back better than before.\" And with that, Fred began his long road to recovery.\n\nComplete the prefix",

The union has been pushing for referees to wear microphones since 2006. \"This is a big step forward for us,\" said Theo van Seggelen, general secretary of FIFPro. \"Referees need to be able to communicate with each other and with the fourth official. This is an important safety issue.\" Referees will also be allowed to use hand signals to indicate that they want to stop play. In addition, the number of assistant referees will be increased from two to four. This will allow for better coverage of the field and help prevent mistakes.

        "output": " the players touched the ball before it went out of bounds. \"I think it's pretty clear,\" Busacca said. \"It's a tough call.\" The play occurred late in the second quarter, with the score tied 7-7. The Patriots were driving toward the end zone when Brady threw a pass to wide receiver Wes Welker, who caught the ball near the sideline. As Welker fell to the ground, he appeared to bat the ball forward. It bounced off the foot of Jets cornerback Antonio Cromartie and rolled out of bounds. The officials ruled that the ball was touched by an offensive player before it went out of bounds, which meant the Patriots retained possession. The Patriots scored a touchdown two plays later. The Jets challenged the ruling, but the replay official upheld the call. On Sunday, Busacca said the replay showed that the ball hit the ground before it touched either Welker or Cromartie. \"The ball hits the ground first,\" Busacca said",

        "output": " Liverpool hearts as they were unable to find an equalizer against a team that has been struggling this season. Fred’s injury is not expected to keep him out long, but it does mean that Manchester United will be missing one of their most important players for the next few weeks. This could spell trouble for them as they face off against Chelsea in the FA Cup final later this month. Fred has been a key player for Manchester United all season long, scoring 10 goals and providing 7 assists in just 27 appearances. His absence will certainly be felt by his teammates, who will need to step up if they want to win the FA Cup. With Fred out injured, Manchester United will likely turn to Jesse Lingard or Juan Mata to fill in at left-back. Both players have experience playing in that position and should be able to provide some much-needed stability for the Red Devils’ defense. However, neither player is as good as Fred when it comes to defending set pieces or making tackles. As such",

He was still getting used to the idea. It was hard to believe that she was really gone. She'd been dead for almost three months now, and yet sometimes he could still hear her voice in his head, telling him what to do next. He knew that she would have wanted him to move on, to start living again. But how? He didn't know where to begin. He felt like he was stuck in a rut, going through the motions of everyday life without any real purpose or direction. He needed something to give his life meaning, something to make him feel alive again. That's when he remembered the letter. He'd seen it lying on the desk in his office, and he'd known immediately what it was. It was a letter from his wife, addressed to him. He'd never opened it",

It was supposed to be a simple matter of adding some new features to an existing system, but somehow everything seemed to go wrong. The code was buggy, the tests weren't working properly, and the whole thing just felt like a mess. He took a deep breath and tried to focus on the problem at hand. Maybe if he could just break down the problem into smaller pieces, he could make some progress. But no matter how hard he tried, he couldn't seem to get anywhere. He was starting to feel frustrated and overwhelmed, and he knew he needed to take a step back and reassess the situation. He stood up from his desk and walked over to the window.

It was a tiny, bare place, since his aunt and uncle were determined to make as few compromises as possible. There wasn’t a single thing in the room that Harry had chosen for himself. Not a picture or a carpet or even a curtain. The only thing that wasn’t ugly was a big old trunk in the corner, which was covered in dust. Harry opened it cautiously. Inside were a lot of small boxes and something wrapped in a very old blanket. Harry lifted the blanket carefully off whatever was underneath it. It was a wand, its tip carved with an unusual reptilian figure. Harry picked it up and held it in front of his face. It looked exactly like his father’s, but it was slightly smaller and more supple than the real one. Harry smiled. This must have been his father’s wand when",

The mayor was a man who liked to talk, and he'd been talking for over an hour now, and Nick was getting tired of listening. But he couldn't afford to miss anything, because this was the story of the year, maybe the decade. The mayor had promised to make New York City the greenest big city in America, and he meant it. He'd already announced plans to plant trees along every street, build bike lanes all over town, and turn abandoned lots into community gardens. And now he was talking about turning Central Park into a giant solar farm. \"It's going to be amazing,\" the mayor said, gesturing grandly toward the park outside the window. \"We're going to generate enough power to light up half the city.\" Nick nodded politely, though he wasn't really paying attention.

All she’d said on the subject was that she couldn’t allow anyone to get hurt on her account. The leaders of Hope Town had travelled with Liza, hoping to mediate the negotiations. After all, they wanted nothing more than to accompany their children, to see what kind of work they’d be doing and how life was progressing in the secretive city of McMurdo. Hearing news of this resistance, the other two Survivor Towns had co-ordinated their efforts, sending representatives from the settlements. New Town was the largest of the three and Trinity Town was located at the tip of the Peninsula. Each of these towns had markedly different characters. New Town considered itself a rival in status to McMurdo, far less bohemian than Hope Town. The citizens placed an overwhelming emphasis on food production, energy and mining, the practicalities of survival. Trinity Town, with the most clement weather, contained a large concentration of people interested in their physical and mental welfare, discovering natural medicines in the ocean, a deeply spiritual community with the most places of worship. To this extent, the Peninsula most closely resembled the division of industry in the nation formerly known as Germany, with an industrial heartland, a bohemian Berlin, the financial city of Frankfurt and the spa towns in the mountains. Kasim stepped forward to address the crowds: ‘My name is Kasim. We are here to collect the last of the ice-adapted students. And those ordinary-born who have been chosen to work at McMurdo.’ Liza declared: ‘I’m the mother of one of those ice-adapted children you’ve come to collect. All we’re asking is to travel with them. To see the kind of life they will have in McMurdo. To make sure they are going to be okay. We want to know what’s going on in McMurdo. You tell us nothing.

After all, they wanted nothing more than to accompany their children, to see what kind of work they’d be doing and how life was progressing in the secretive city of McMurdo. Hearing news of this resistance, the other two Survivor Towns had co-ordinated their efforts, sending representatives from the settlements. New Town was the largest of the three and Trinity Town was located at the tip of the Peninsula. Each of these towns had markedly different characters.

And those ordinary-born who have been chosen to work at McMurdo.’ Liza declared: ‘I’m the mother of one of those ice-adapted children you’ve come to collect. All we’re asking is to travel with them. To see the kind of life they will have in McMurdo. To make sure they are going to be okay. We want to know what’s going on in McMurdo. You tell us nothing.

The scar was a kind of badge that showed the whole world he was special, just like Dumbledore had always told him. \"You are the boy who lived: whoever heard of such a remarkable thing? You are destined for great things, Harry.\" Dumbledore had always been very interested in Harry's scar, which he called a \"curious\" feature.

Not just the spells and potions, but the feeling of wonder and awe that came with seeing things that couldn’t possibly exist.

He missed the adventures, the excitement, the danger. He missed everything about Hogwarts, except maybe the homework. But mostly, he missed Harry Potter.

He had fled around a corner and behind him he heard the terrible sound of the Death Eaters' yells, and then the explosion that had signalled the death of Lord Voldemort. And after that, silence. For ten long years silence had reigned over the magical community, during which time Harry Potter had lived among Muggles, enduring the taunts of a no-good-for-a-wizard name, wondering whether he would ever be lucky enough to perform magic out of the hundreds of tiny pokes, prods and pricks with which his aunt Dursley, Uncle Vernon, and cousin Dudley kept him immobilised.

But she was attended by other servants. Alice observed her, studied her daily movements. She didn’t talk to her at all. The Bond Street seamstresses managed all the fittings for Madam’s ball dress. Alice despised it. It was black, per instruction, suitable for mourning. But the sleeves were fussy, heavy, and the lace looked almost antique in its design. The seamstresses worked section by section, sending parts up to Park Lane for Alice to finish. Hackwork, really, the kind of thing she could do with her eyes closed. Yet she found herself unpicking their stitches, remaking the lines, softening the gown’s edges. Trying to make it elegant. Sometimes, when she was hanging about for the latest delivery, Alice would make sketches of the gown that she’d design for Madam. Something with a little pep to it, something with a little go.

However, Harry Potter was a wizard, and as he grew older, it became more difficult for him to keep his talent hidden from his Muggle relatives. At age eleven, he received a letter from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry - a place where he would belong. He packed his trunk and left Privet Drive for good. On Platform Nine and Three-Quarters, Harry boarded the Hogwarts Express and met Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger, two fellow first-year students. Together, they learned the ins and outs of the wizarding world, including how to cast spells, brew potions, and fly broomsticks. As time passed, Harry's powers grew stronger, and he began to realize just how special he truly was. He discovered that he was the Chosen One, destined to defeat Lord Voldemort, the most powerful Dark wizard who ever lived. With the help of his friends and allies, Harry fought against evil forces and protected",

She still felt a pang when she saw her mother’s friend Andrea at the intercom. A minute later, Mira emerged in yoga pants and an oversized Tshirt emblazoned with an ornate hamsa, reusable shopping bags slung over her shoulder.

        "output": " magic was nothing more than sleight of hand. But Harry Potter wasn't a Muggle, he was a wizard - and he was about to find himself surrounded by owls and witches, ghosts and mummies...and have a nasty accident with a giant three-headed dog! So it was with great delight that I read this book again recently. It's one of those books that I've always loved, but never really got around to re-reading. I'm so glad I finally did because it was even better than I remembered. The story is simple enough: Harry Potter is a young boy who discovers that he is a wizard and attends Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. There he meets friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger, and enemies Draco Malfoy and Severus Snape.

The characters are well-developed and lik",

        "output": " you’re wondering why Harry Potter is so popular, well, there are many reasons. But one reason is that J.K. Rowling created a world where magic is real, and where wizards and witches live among us. In this world, there are many different types of magical creatures, including unicorns, dragons, and mermaids. There are also many different kinds of spells, potions, and charms. And there are many different ways to use magic, such as through wands, brooms, and cauldrons. But perhaps the most important aspect of Harry Potter is its message of hope and friendship. Through the adventures of Harry, Ron, Hermione, and their friends, readers learn that even in the darkest times, there is always hope. They also learn that true friendship is worth fighting for, no matter what obstacles stand in your way. So if you’re looking for a story that will transport you to a world of wonder and adventure, look no further than Harry Potter. You won’t regret",

But now he realised that Dumbledore had known what he was doing. His hand strayed to his neck, and he touched the chain around it, feeling the small golden locket hanging from it.

It was hard to explain, because he didn’t really understand it himself. He’d never seen a Shrinking Potion before, but he knew that if he drank some, he would shrink. He’d also heard that if you put too much into your mouth, you could choke. So he’d written about the dangers of choking, which seemed like a good idea at the time. But when he read over the essay later, he realised that it sounded like he was saying that Shrinking Potions were dangerous. Which wasn’t true at all! They were perfectly safe, as long as you used them properly. He decided to rewrite the whole thing, but by then it was too late. Professor McGonagall had already marked it.

Someone slapped him on the back. “Thank you again for your assistance, Cates.” August looked back over his shoulder to find one of the police officers holding his hand out for a shake. But thanks to his beanstalk being at full maturity, he could only turn partially and slap his hand into the officer’s waiting palm. “Don’t mention it.” The guy just stood there nodding and grinning, shifting in his boots. Oh man, August knew that look. He was seconds from getting invited out for a beer with the bros. “I need to get my wife home before she catches a cold.” Natalie ran a knuckle down his happy trail and he almost swallowed his tongue. “The only thing I’m going to catch,” she whispered for his ears alone, “is this di—” “All right, you take care, man. Let’s have a beer sometime,” August blurted, pushing Natalie’s legs into the truck, his blood thickening like hot gravy. At this point, he didn’t even care who saw his boner, as long as he got the woman home in the next ten minutes. Rest in peace to his headboard. In a few long strides, he was around the front bumper, diving into the driver’s side and reversing through the maze of emergency vehicles. “Oh, you are going to get it, Natalie queen princess Cates.” She slid gracefully across the front row of his truck, pressing her mouth to his shoulder. Kissing, licking . . . and biting down in way that sent his balls up into his throat. “Fuck.” “Yes, please.” She gripped his cock through the wet material of his sweatpants and in one big, shuddering breath, he fogged up every single window of the truck. “And I don’t need you to take it easy on me.

Maud dropped her shovel and walked backward to see. Since planting the final bed of lupine and roses, she and Chris had been emptying wheelbarrow after wheelbarrow of gravel and raking it into a smooth, glistering maze that slipped past one bed to another: irises to coneflowers, primroses to violets. Sweet potato vines spilled from the cast-iron urns under a conflagration of begonias. With its swirls and splashes of color, the garden was more like a brilliant, bold archipelago than the carpet Downing had described. “What do you think?” she asked Chris.

It was hard to explain, because he didn’t really understand it himself. He’d never seen a Shrinking Potion before, but he knew that if he drank some, he would shrink. He’d also heard that if you put too much into your mouth, you could choke. So he’d written about the dangers of choking, which seemed like a good idea at the time. But when he read over the essay later, he realised that it sounded like he was saying that Shrinking Potions were dangerous. Which wasn’t true at all! They were perfectly safe, as long as you used them properly. He decided to rewrite the whole thing, but by then it was too late. Professor McGonagall had already marked it. She’d given him a very low mark, and told him that he needed to do better next time.",

He lumbered to his feet, uncertain what had happened, but the fires in the hall had burned down, and it was dark. “Enva?” he called to her. His voice carried through the rock to find her. “Enva!” He feared she had gone, but she emerged into the hall, carrying a torch. “What happened?” he demanded, but Enva was poised and calm. “I’m not certain,” she replied with a yawn. “I only just woke, a minute before you.” Dacre was disconcerted, but in that moment, he thought Enva beautiful, and he trusted her. Not a week passed before he was hungry for her music again, and he called another assembly in the hall, so she could entertain them. She played for sorrow. For joy. And then for sleep. This time, she sang her lullaby twice as long, and Dacre and his court slept for six days and six nights. By the time Dacre stirred awake, cold and stiff, when he called to Enva through the stone there was no answer. He reached to feel her presence, which was like a thread of sunlight in his fortress, but there was only darkness. Enraged, he realized she had gone above. He rallied his creatures and his servants to fight, but when they emerged through the secret doorways into the world above, Enva and a Skyward host\n\n\nComplete the prefix:\nthe cupboard under the stairs, grabbed some of his books and hidden them in his bedroom.

Harry tried to hide his book behind his back, but it was too late. “Reading,” he said. “But it’s past your bedtime!” “Sorry, Mum,” Harry said. “I’ll go to bed now.” “No, you won’t,” his mother said. “You’re going straight downstairs to bed.

He wanted to be normal, and if being normal meant being bullied by Draco Malfoy and his friends, then so be it. It wasn't until the end of his first year at Hogwarts that Harry realized just how much he'd been missing out on. That's when he met Hermione Granger, a Muggle-born witch who was determined to help him understand his magical heritage. Together, they set out to uncover the truth about Voldemort's rise to power and defeat him once and for all. Along the way, they made some unlikely allies, including Ron Weasley, a Gryffindor boy who was always ready to lend a hand. With their combined strength, they were able to overcome even the most daunting obstacles and emerge victorious. In the end, Harry learned that there was nothing wrong with being different - in fact, it was what",

If the victim persisted, the witch or wizard might have to resort to a more serious charm, such as the Stunning Spell, which would leave the victim unconscious for an hour or two. But this was rarely necessary, since most people were easily fooled by the simple trick of pretending to scream. Of course, there were always those who were too clever for their own good, and who insisted on testing the witch or wizard’s powers. These people were usually wizards themselves, and they tended to be quite annoying.

It was almost as if he was using the negative energy to fuel his own power. As the years went on, Harry became more and more powerful. He started to develop abilities that even the most experienced wizards had never seen before. His powers were so great that he was eventually able to escape from Hogwarts and start his own school for young witches and wizards. There, he taught them how to use their magic in ways that were both creative and destructive.

The Beornings were a hardy race that dwelt in the woods of Wold and guarded the great forest road that ran through the mountains from Thranduil’s realm in the south to Dale in the north. They loved all living things, especially beasts, and they hated all dragons and giants; so they were friends of the Dwarves and enemies of Smaug.

All through school he sat with his head bent down so that nobody could see his face. His teachers liked him—and indeed his classmates liked him well enough—but they didn't understand him, and of course they laughed at him. They were all of them big, hearty boys, and used to doing whatever they wanted to do. And they all thought there must be something funny about little Georgie's shyness. So they teased him unmercifully, and called him names behind his back. But Georgie never answered back; he simply kept his head down and went on being shy. When he grew older, he left school and got a job in a shop. There he met a girl who fell in love with him. But she was very pretty, and lots of other men also loved her. So she married one",

Then repeats, “Yes?” “But”—I force myself to continue past her face-splitting grin—“I can’t formally accept until I talk with my advisor. Don’t worry, though,” I add quickly, because her smile is fading fast. “I’m sure I’ll get his approval next week! I’ll explain how much I want to take the job, and he’ll agree that it’s the best choice.” George stares for a second, looking considerably less excited. “Okay.” She nods. And when I’m about to leave, she adds, “For the record, I’d love to continue being your friend. Even if you end up not accepting.” Her smile is a little strained. “Now peace out. I gotta pee, and no, you can’t listen, you weirdo.” I’m making my way back to the living room, wondering why it feels like George just resigned herself to me not taking the job, when I overhear it. “. . . slumming it with the theorists now?” It’s Andrea’s voice from the kitchen, and I stop in the hallway.

However, there is no evidence to support this claim. The most likely explanation for the existence of the Amazons is that they were simply a group of female warriors who fought alongside men during ancient times.

This had a power of its own to make people invisible; but the secret of this lay long after-wards in Thror’s Halls. One day Bilbo journeyed with his uncle and cousins on an adventure into the Misty Mountains. There they found a great cave full of treasure, guarded by three trolls. The trolls caught them, and were just going to cook and eat them, when suddenly night fell and they had to put out their fire. While they slept Bilbo crept away and stole the troll’s treasure. But the trolls woke up and chased him. He ran off as fast as he could, and came to a small house where he met",

Now there was an increase in wisdom, and element of doubt, some care for old age and a desire for new things; some balance of malice and ruthlessness, and no little prudence, with a fleeting hint of courage. It is said that many of the younger hobbits began now to study writing (which was here employed mainly for account-keeping and the inscribing of legal documents), and to desire knowledge of trees, stars, and earthworms (for all these the hobbits of the Shire had at that time some fancy, from ignorance).

He was just trying to make himself seem important. One day, I went to visit him at his house. He lived in a big mansion with a lot of servants. When I arrived, he was sitting in his study, reading a book. \"Hello, Grandpa,\" I said. \"What's new?\" \"Nothing much,\" he replied. \"Just the usual.\" \"Well, can I see your dragon collection?\" I asked. \"Oh, yes,\" he said. \"Of course.\"",

She leans forward, happier now. “Yes. Now we’re getting somewhere. Romance is joyful. What brings you joy?” “My daughter. My work, historically speaking.” I dig around for something that makes me sound more dimensional, but sitting here with this bestselling author talking about joy and connection makes my life feel like a lather, rinse, repeat of arid routine. “Watching footie.

It was not any one thing stealing my breath; it was everything at once. The sudden atomization of Yahav and Jerome and Lance. Maybe the podcast, too, gone in a puff of smoke. The slow melting of any certainty I’d had about Thalia’s death, a melting I’d been terrified to acknowledge but could no longer ignore.

Those were the same woods where Barbara Crocker’s body was found in 1975, just outside the Granby property line.

Louise’s mom had claimed to be allergic to all pets, including goldfish, for their entire childhoods, and it wasn’t until Louise got out of grad school that her mom revealed she’d simply never wanted anything in the house that might die. “It would have upset you and your brother too much,” she’d explained. When Louise had Poppy, she vowed to be honest about death. She knew that stating the facts plainly would be the best way for Poppy to understand that death was part of life. She would answer all Poppy’s questions with absolute honesty, and if she didn’t know something they’d figure out the answer together. “I’m going to Charleston tomorrow,” Louise told Poppy that night, sitting on the story-time chair beside her bed, in the glow of the plastic goose lamp. “And I want you to understand why. Your grandmother and grandfather had a very bad accident.” Louise saw safety glass exploding, metal tearing and twisting. “And their bodies got hurt very badly. They got hurt so badly that they stopped working. And your grandmother and grandfather died.” Poppy shot up in bed, smashing into Louise like a cannonball, wrapping her arms around her ribs too tight, bursting into a long, keening wail. “No!” Poppy screamed. “No! No!” Louise tried to explain that it was okay, that she was sad, too, that they would be sad together and that being sad when someone died was normal, but every time she started to speak, Poppy wiped her face back\n\n\nComplete the prefix:\nmy dear sir!

But I shake my head. “If we get together right now, Lanier will know it’s because we met up at the wedding and she’ll blame me. She’ll be furious.” Huff sighs and rolls his eyes. “Damn, Daph. Why do you care so much? What happened back then was a long time ago. She has to realize that.” He is partially right. But our big breakup, when we were twenty-three and twenty-five, had less to do with her and more with what I’d thought was the right thing. But it was easier to blame her than to blame myself. Seven years ago , I still had my mother’s voice in my head—and her addictive nature in my body. I was afraid then that love would drown me, just like it had my mother. Lanier pleaded with me not to take Huff down with me. I loved him too much to do that. The irony that I later found myself sober, pregnant, and starting a family with a man I didn’t love as much wasn’t lost on me. But instead of saying that, I say, “Huff, you have this big, magical, amazing family. I have Lanier. So losing her would be like losing everything and everyone.” He wraps me in a hug. “You have me, Daphne,” he whispers. “You always have.” He pulls back and kisses me. “You are all I care about. I’m not going to lose you again.” I look up into his sad eyes, and I start to feel that same thing I have always felt for him.

We went through her sisters’ closets for things they hadn’t been back to claim. I cultivated a look I’d now call goth grunge, designed to hide my weight: all black, a flannel shirt either tied around my waist or flung on open like a coat. At Clover Music in Kern, I bought chokers made of hemp and Fimo, black-light nail polish. Fran gave me her old Doc Martens, duct-taped at the toes and a size too big. I plucked my eyebrows into sharp little checkmarks. Everyone was doing this, but mine were extreme. I learned to apply thick black eyeliner. I’d spent the summer shedding what I’d seen as pathetic artifice, ready to return as my true self. Sophomore year was when Carlotta French showed up, a refugee from an all-girls’ school in Virginia, and all but announced that Fran and I were her new best friends, positions we happily accepted because Carlotta was cooler than either of us. Carlotta wore ankle bracelets and no bra. When she played guitar on a blanket under trees, boys who theoretically were interested only in preppy girls out of shampoo commercials would move their Frisbee games closer, end up lying on their stomachs to talk to her.

It began with visionaries; and apart from the wild experiments of our grandfathers, everything became more controlled, more orderly, more predictable, safer; and it never really occurred to anyone to wonder what might have been lost. But every now and then the old hunger stirred, and a few brave souls ventured forth to explore the forgotten places. And sometimes they returned bearing strange tales.

He joked that he wanted to strap the magnets to his own head, maybe stimulate some of his own deadbeat cells. “So this is the magic bullet?” Orson asked, inspecting a pair of magnetic coils that looked like old-fashioned film reels stacked close together. “Yeah,” Mack said, switching the wad of gum he was chewing to the other side of his mouth. “You want to try it?” Orson gamely strapped on the little cotton cap and sat back in what could have been a dentist’s chair while Mack positioned the coils over his head, loudly smacking his gum the entire time. “You’re going to feel something,” Mack said, smiling. “Or not.” “Hit me,” Orson said.

But then I went to college and met people who didn't believe in magic. They thought I was crazy. And I guess I am. Because even though I know better, sometimes I still feel like I'm a real witch.

It had been written two days after Sirius's escape from Azkaban, and Harry had found it very moving. Sirius had described how he had spent his first night of freedom, alone in the woods, unable to sleep, terrified that the Dementors might find him. Then he had remembered that he was free, and had laughed aloud. 'It was the best laugh I've had in ages,' wrote Sirius. 'I felt like shouting it to the world. I felt like dancing.

There has also been a number of reports of them attacking people. One man reported that he was walking home late at night when he heard a noise behind him. He turned around and saw a large bird standing on the pavement. As he approached it, the bird took flight and attacked him, pecking at his face and neck. Another witness said that they saw a group of these birds circling overhead before swooping down onto a car and pecking at the windscreen. These attacks have led some people to believe that these birds may be aggressive towards humans. However, others believe that they are simply curious and are trying to get a closer look at us. Whatever the reason, these mysterious birds continue to fascinate and intrigue people all over the world. If you see one of these birds, be sure to take a picture and report your sighting to the nearest wildlife centre",

Uncle Vernon couldn’t walk for three days. Aunt Petunia said Skeeter had gone too far that time, and Uncle Vernon agreed. So Skeeter went to live in the kitchen.

A university is a small, fractious mini-state all its own, and it has heroes and villains and victims of circumstance and it is not always easy to tell them apart when you’re in the top chair.

If you’re in the top chair and you’re a little devious—which is kind of a basic qualification for the job—you might seek out such a person so as to know who to call if ever the need arose, and if you were that kind of person, you might make it your business to let that be known, so that your name comes up at the right time.

And while she waited, she roamed Dacre’s underground fortress, those old ley lines of magic, memorizing its twists and bends and its many secret doorways to above. Three days and three nights later, Dacre finally awoke, closely followed by his brothers, and then the remainder of his court. His mind was foggy; his hands felt numb. He lumbered to his feet, uncertain what had happened, but the fires in the hall had burned down, and it was dark. “Enva?” he called to her.

He reached to feel her presence, which was like a thread of sunlight in his fortress, but there was only darkness. Enraged, he realized she had gone above.

How long would her music hold them ensorcelled? She left the hall and decided to wait and see. And while she waited, she roamed Dacre’s underground fortress, those old ley lines of magic, memorizing its twists and bends and its many secret doorways to above. Three days and three nights later, Dacre finally awoke, closely followed by his brothers, and then the remainder of his court. His mind was foggy; his hands felt numb. He lumbered to his feet, uncertain what had happened, but the fires in the hall had burned down, and it was dark. “Enva?” he called to her. His voice carried through the rock to find her. “Enva!” He feared she had gone, but she emerged into the hall, carrying a torch. “What happened?” he demanded, but Enva was poised and calm. “I’m not certain,” she replied with a yawn. “I only just woke, a minute before you.” Dacre was disconcerted, but in that moment, he thought Enva beautiful, and he trusted her. Not a week passed before he was hungry for her music again, and he called another assembly in the hall, so she could entertain them. She played for sorrow. For joy. And then for sleep. This time, she sang her lullaby twice as long, and Dacre and his court slept for six days and six nights. By the time Dacre stirred awake, cold and stiff, when he called to Enva through the stone there was no answer. He reached to feel her presence, which was like a thread of sunlight in his fortress, but there was only darkness. Enraged, he realized she had gone above.

At the age of one, Harry had somehow survived a curse from the greatest dark sorcerer of all time, Lord Voldemort, whose name most witches and wizards still feared to speak. Harry's parents had died in Voldemort's attack, but Harry had escaped with his lightning scar, and somehow nobody understood why Voldemort's powers had been destroyed the instant he had failed to kill Harry. So Harry had been brought up by his dead mother's sister and her husband. He had spent ten years with the Dursleys, never understanding why he kept making",
