But it was not in any way a coincidence that today, the day of culmination of the project, the great day of unveiling, the day that the Heart of Gold was finally to be introduced to a marvelling Galaxy, was also a great day of culmination for Zaphod Beeblebrox. It was for the sake of this day that he had first decided to run for the Presidency, a decision which had sent waves of astonishment throughout the Imperial Galaxy - Zaphod Beeblebrox? President? Not the Zaphod Beeblebrox? Not the President? Many had seen it as a clinching proof that the whole of known creation had finally gone bananas. Zaphod grinned and gave the boat an extra kick of speed.

He sat in silence, staring at his Kito sandals and fighting the urge to play with the Velcro strap. Where were all the arguments he had prepared, all those reasonable words he could have spoken instead of whining “Is it fair?” like the small boy his parents still thought he was? Why had they all fled down his throat instead of coming out of his lips like he wanted them to? He began to cry again, quietly this time, sniffling without sobbing. He did not notice that his father was back in the car until it shuddered and screeched to a start. Ẹniọlá reached for the door. His father gripped his wrist. “Come on, wipe your cheeks first before you go down. Don’t let anyone see you crying.” That evening, Ẹniọlá’s father gave him a new copy of Ugo C. Ugo’s book of practice questions for common entrance examinations. For a few moments, he thought he’d at last prevailed against his parents, but his happiness lasted only until his father began to speak. “Look, you can write the exams now if you want, but”—he held up a finger—“but if you wait for a year and complete primary six, which, as I have told you times without number, is an essential part of the six-three-three-four system of education—very essential part of it, I tell you. Even though most schools are just doing things anyhow these days. Anyway, if you do this right and stay on till primary six, you can go to the federal government college in Ìkìrun. The choice is yours.” Ẹniọlá had wanted to attend the Federal Unity school in Ìkìrun since Collins, whose family lived in the flat upstairs, had gone off to secondary school there three years before, returning during every holiday with stories of fun and freedom that Ẹniọlá knew would not be possible if he went to a school that was close to home.

Then Frankie said: \"Here's a thought.

In winter it was cool and quiet, and very beautiful. In summer it was peaceful and hay-scented, with no noise except the whisper of leaves and the songs of birds; and sometimes, if the wind was right, which it wasn't today, a far grimmer sound could be heard: the wailing of hulls sailing away from the Grey Havens in the fogayes of the Sea. The Hill: in Hobbiton that meant the large hill called Green Hill outside the western side of the village, but in other parts of the Shire different hills would have been so named. On the top of the Hill there used to stand an old tree (broken by storms long ago) that was said to have been great once, an oak of the Mark or of the people of Elmiston that fled hither before Saur",

It also served as a nickname for Thorin Oakenshield, the most stalwart and industrious of the thirteen dwarves accompanying Bilbo on his unexpected journey. Thorin was a great lover of gold and silver, and he had been known to spend hours poring over maps of the Lonely Mountain, trying to find the best way to reach its treasure trove.

A mug, two different vases, another bowl that doesn’t really look butt-like at all. Or hardly, anyway. I pass him my phone. He studies it, his tongue tracing over his bottom lip as he slowly flips through the pictures. We’ve done at least one full rotation on the Ferris wheel by the time he reaches the last one and starts flipping back the other way, pausing on each, zooming in to see the details of the glazes. “This one.” He’s staring at the smaller of the vases, streaked with shades of green, blue, purple, and brown, a horizon of earthy colors. My heart squeezes. “That one’s called Hank.” He looks up, face open, with the expression that used to make me think of quicksand, a face that could pull you in and never let you go. “You named it?” he says. “After my dad?” “Isn’t that humiliating?” I try to pull my phone away. He doesn’t let go. “Why would it be humiliating?” “Because I’m not Michelangelo,” I say. “My vases don’t need names.” He holds the phone up. “This one needs a fucking name, and that name is Hank.” I reach for it again, but he yanks it out of reach, goes back to staring at the screen, creases rising from the insides of his brows. Quietly, he says, “It looks like him.” “You don’t have to say that, Wyn,” I reply. “It’s a vase, by an amateur.” “It looks like Montana,” he says. “The colors are exactly right\n\n\nComplete the prefix:\nthe world, when there was less noise and more green, and the hobbits were still numerous and prosperous, and Bilbo",

Wizards kept themselves very well hidden from the No-Maj world and it was generally agreed among them that it should stay that way. For centuries wizards had lived quite happily alongside No-Majs, keeping themselves secret and unaffected by the non-magical world until something went wrong. It happened every few hundred years when some wizard let details of the magical community slip out into the Muggle world. This time it was the fault of the goblins. They had always been difficult to deal with, but now they were becoming downright dangerous. Goblins were short, ugly little creatures who lived mainly underground and did most of the world’s goldsmithing. They were also highly skilled bankers and loan sharks and they owned Gringotts, the wizarding bank. In recent years, however, they had become increasingly aggressive towards wizards and",

The tiniest part of me has hoped she would approve of this relationship now, if there ever was one. But Lanier apparently still doesn’t trust me. “Daph, forget Lanier. Let’s do this. Finally.” I consider his offer briefly because, well, it’s what I want to do. But I shake my head. “If we get together right now, Lanier will know it’s because we met up at the wedding and she’ll blame me. She’ll be furious.” Huff sighs and rolls his eyes. “Damn, Daph. Why do you care so much? What happened back then was a long time ago. She has to realize that.” He is partially right. But our big breakup, when we were twenty-three and twenty-five, had less to do with her and more with what I’d thought was the right thing. But it was easier to blame her than to blame myself. Seven years ago , I still had my mother’s voice in my head—and her addictive nature in my body. I was afraid then that love would drown me, just like it had my mother. Lanier pleaded with me not to take Huff down with me. I loved him too much to do that. The irony that I later found myself sober, pregnant, and starting a family with a man I didn’t love as much wasn’t lost on me.

They had saved each other’s lives, and they had helped each other through some of the hardest times of their lives. They had grown up together, and they had become the people they were today because of each other.

So he set off, running at random through the dark streets, not looking where he was going, hands outstretched in the pitch-blackness, waiting for something to grab him. He ran till dawn was just a memory, and he was shivering all over and feeling very hungry; then he sat down in a doorway and fell asleep. He woke late in the afternoon cold, stiff, and wet.

He glanced down like he’d forgotten, frowned at his bloody shirt. “Fine,” he said. “Must’ve just been a scratch.” It’d been more than that. At least, Lore thought it had been. But when he raised his shirt, the skin was unblemished, marred only by a scrim of dried blood. A hand on her shoulder—Bastian, gently moving her away from the outstretched knife in Milo’s stone hand. His fingers slid to the back of her neck, into her hair; his thumb brushed her cheek, then dropped, and he stepped away. “Right,” he said, with a decisive nod. “Well. We can’t leave him here, and I assume you aren’t up to changing him back just yet?” “If we can.” Gabe’s voice was quiet, hoarse. “If we can change him back.” “Either way, we’ll have to move him.” A rickety cart slouched against the wall on the other end of the alley; Bastian went and tugged on one of the handles.

This was a common prank among young wizards and witches, but it was also used as a means of intimidation by some Dark wizards and witches. For example, during the 1990s, a group of Death Eaters led by Lucius Malfoy used this technique to frighten Muggles into giving them money. In addition, the Ministry of Magic has been known to use this tactic against those who are suspected of being involved in criminal activity. However, despite its widespread use, there is no evidence that the Flame-Freezing Charm actually causes physical harm to anyone who falls victim to it. Instead, it appears to be nothing more than an elaborate hoax designed to make people believe they are experiencing something supernatural. As such, it should not be taken seriously by anyone who knows better.\n\nComplete the prefix:\nThe first time I saw my father's face, I was five years old. My mother had brought me to visit",

However, there were some who took it too far and ended up hurting themselves instead of their victims. One such incident occurred when a group of young witches and wizards decided to play a prank on an unsuspecting Muggle family. They performed the Flame-Freezing Charm on the father’s hand, causing him to scream in agony as if he had been burned by fire. The mother rushed over to help her husband, but before she could do anything, the children began laughing hysterically. The father, still in pain, turned around and saw his wife and children laughing at him. He became furious and started yelling at them, demanding to know why they were laughing at him. The children continued to laugh, saying that they were just playing a joke on him. The father lost control and grabbed one of the children by the arm, pulling him close",

The Ministry had decreed that all wizards and witches must carry a wand at all times. And if you were caught without your wand, you’d be fined five Galleons. Five Galleons! That was more than some families earned in a year. I couldn’t believe it. I mean, I knew the Ministry was getting stricter and stricter, but this was ridiculous. I was just trying to enjoy a quiet cup of tea. What was wrong with that? I decided to take matters into my own hands. I went down to Diagon Alley and bought myself a fake wand. It looked exactly like an ordinary wand, except it was made of rubber. I put it in my pocket and headed home. When I got there, I found that the Ministry had already arrived.

This is not the sort of place for a hotel, is it? I received your host’s assent to my enquiry the day after I wrote to you, and departed Cambridge immediately thereafter.

In fact, this was how the term \"lightning bolt\" came into use as a metaphor for a bad grade on a school test. The charm was also used to scare away intruders, though it was rarely effective because most people would simply assume that the house was haunted. The spell was also used to create a distraction during a robbery, allowing the thief to escape unnoticed. However, the spell was not foolproof, as some victims would become suspicious and investigate further. In one case, a man named George Weasley was able to deduce that he had been the target of a prank and confronted the perpetrator, who turned out to be his own father. Despite its flaws, the Flame-Freezing Charm remained popular among wizards and witches throughout history. It was even featured in several books and movies, including Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone",

Viv watched as Meg and Wyatt settled into two straight-back molded plastic seats. It was as if time had stood still here in this small town. The so-called hospital was more like a health clinic straight out of the twentieth century. The reception room was about two hundred square feet, with speckled brown and white linoleum tiles, egg-colored walls half covered with battered oak wainscoting having seen better days decades ago. There was a large bay window in serious need of a good scrubbing, but it at least allowed the morning sun in to brighten the all but otherwise unremarkable room.

The so-called hospital was more like a health clinic straight out of the twentieth century. The reception room was about two hundred square feet, with speckled brown and white linoleum tiles, egg-colored walls half covered with battered oak wainscoting having seen better days decades ago.

        "output": " nice cup of tea. The victim would be left wondering why they hadn’t been able to burn their own skin off. The next step was to use a simple Disarming Charm to remove the wand from the victim’s hands. Then, the witch or wizard would simply say, “I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to do that,” and walk away. If the victim tried to follow them, the witch or wizard would simply cast a Confundus Charm on them, making them forget where they were going. Finally, the witch or wizard would cast a Memory Charm on the victim, erasing all memory of the incident. This would leave the victim feeling confused and disoriented, but unable to remember exactly what happened. With these three spells, a witch or wizard can easily escape from a situation without anyone knowing what really happened. So, if you ever find yourself in a sticky situation, remember to use these spells wisely!",

His heart began to thump uncomfortably, a sure sign (as Harry well knew) that trouble was lying just ahead.

Not a picture or a carpet or even a curtain. The only thing that wasn’t ugly was a big old trunk in the corner, which was covered in dust. Harry opened it cautiously. Inside were a lot of small boxes and something wrapped in a very old blanket. Harry lifted the blanket carefully off whatever was underneath it. It was a wand, its tip carved with an unusual reptilian figure. Harry picked it up and held it in front of his face. It looked exactly like his father’s, but it was slightly smaller and more supple than the real one. Harry smiled. This must have been his father’s wand when",

She had thought about just knocking on the door, but Mira would panic if she showed up unannounced. And how would Alex explain where she’d gotten the money to fly home? She still felt a pang when she saw her mother’s friend Andrea at the intercom. A minute later, Mira emerged in yoga pants and an oversized Tshirt emblazoned with an ornate hamsa, reusable shopping bags slung over her shoulder. They strode off together, arms and legs pumping in a power walk, and Alex followed for a while. She knew they were headed to the farmers’ market, where they’d buy bone broth or spirulina or organic alfalfa. Her mother looked happy and golden, her blond hair freshly highlighted, her soft arms tanned. She looked like a stranger. The Mira Alex knew lived in a constant state of worry for her angry, crazy daughter. This woman’s daughter went to Yale. She had a summer job. She texted photos of her roommates and new spring flowers and noodle bowls. Alex sat down on a bench at the edge of the park, and watched her mother and Andrea disappear into the white tents of the market. She felt breathless and teary and like she wanted to hit something. Mira had been a crap mother, too caught up in her own storms to be any kind of an anchor. For a while Alex had hated her, and some part of her still did. She hadn’t been born with her mother’s gift for forgiving or forgetting. She didn’t have Mira’s sunshine hair and soft blue eyes, her love for peace, her bookshelves lined with ways to be kinder, more empathetic, a gentler being in the world, a force for good. The awful truth was that if she could have stopped loving her mother, she would have.

After all, they wanted nothing more than to accompany their children, to see what kind of work they’d be doing and how life was progressing in the secretive city of McMurdo. Hearing news of this resistance, the other two Survivor Towns had co-ordinated their efforts, sending representatives from the settlements. New Town was the largest of the three and Trinity Town was located at the tip of the Peninsula. Each of these towns had markedly different characters. New Town considered itself a rival in status to McMurdo, far less bohemian than Hope Town. The citizens placed an overwhelming emphasis on food production, energy and mining, the practicalities of survival. Trinity Town, with the most clement weather, contained a large concentration of people interested in their physical and mental welfare, discovering natural medicines in the ocean, a deeply spiritual community with the most places of worship.

All she’d said on the subject was that she couldn’t allow anyone to get hurt on her account. The leaders of Hope Town had travelled with Liza, hoping to mediate the negotiations. After all, they wanted nothing more than to accompany their children, to see what kind of work they’d be doing and how life was progressing in the secretive city of McMurdo. Hearing news of this resistance, the other two Survivor Towns had co-ordinated their efforts, sending representatives from the settlements. New Town was the largest of the three and Trinity Town was located at the tip of the Peninsula. Each of these towns had markedly different characters. New Town considered itself a rival in status to McMurdo, far less bohemian than Hope Town. The citizens placed an overwhelming emphasis on food production, energy and mining, the practicalities of survival. Trinity Town, with the most clement weather, contained a large concentration of people interested in their physical and mental welfare, discovering natural medicines in the ocean, a deeply spiritual community with the most places of worship.

It is my pleasure to say that J.K. Rowling has written a book about a young wizard, and his training at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Inside this volume of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone you will find many thrilling, magical, and educational stories. The tales told here will excite you, make you laugh, and may even make you cry. But be warned. You may have heard that reading Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone will turn you into a wizard. This is not true. However, it could happen. If it does, please remember that magic is dangerous. Never wave a wand at anything important unless you know what you're doing.

Thomas Mueller scored twice, while Miroslav Klose, Toni Kroos, Sami Khedira and Andre Schurrle also netted. It was the biggest loss ever suffered by Brazil in a World Cup match. The Brazilians had not conceded more than three goals in a game since 1978. The Germans are now one win away from winning their fourth World Cup title.

The Brazilians were booed off the field after the game, and their fans left the stadium early. They were stunned by the result. \"I'm speechless,\" said Brazilian star Neymar. \"We're very sad.\" The loss ended Brazil's hopes of winning a record sixth World Cup title. The team had been considered the favorites to win the tournament, and many expected them to dominate the competition. Instead, they were humiliated by the Germans. The match was a disaster for Brazil. The team looked sluggish and disorganized, and they failed to create any real scoring chances. The German defense was impenetrable, and the Brazilian attack was",

No. “Oh, Dad.” The coffin lid is propped up, resting against the wall. Waiting. That’s it. He really is gone. “No.” I shake my head. “No.” Mum rubs my back. “It’s okay, Maame.” “No! It’s not okay!” Mum pulls me to her, and I cry into her jumper until my throat is tight. I step away and roughly dry my eyes because I need to see him. This will be my last chance to see him. I turn my head and notice he looks … the same, except maybe his lips have thinned a little. He could be sleeping. I stare until I realize I’m waiting for his eyes to open. There’s no look of frustration or uncertainty on his face, the expressions I’d grown used to seeing. His forehead is smooth, and his hands, placed on his stomach, are still. He’s not in pain anymore. He has on his gray wedding suit, a white shirt underneath, and I press a hand to my mouth when I see he also wears his chunky silver bracelet, the bracelet he has on in the photograph I have of him, the bracelet that has been on his wrist through sickness and in health. Mum speaks to him in Twi. “May God bless you, Fiifi. Go with Him, okay? Go with God; see your parents again; they’re calling you and waiting for you.

        "output": " in the World Cup final. The Germans were down 5-0 at halftime, but scored three goals in the second half to make the score respectable. The game was played in front of 58,141 fans at Estadio Mineirao. Germany will play Argentina in Sunday’s final. The match was the first time since 1958 that Brazil had lost a World Cup match at home. The Brazilians had won their previous 62 games at home. The loss was the worst defeat in Brazilian history. The previous record was a 6-0 loss to Uruguay in 1920. Brazil’s star player Neymar left the field after taking an elbow to the back of the head from German defender Max Meyer. Neymar was taken off the field on a stretcher and did not return. Brazil coach Luiz Felipe Scolari said he would not blame the referee for the loss. “I think we can’t blame the referee for what happened today,” Scolari said. “",

But despite its problems, soccer remains the world's most popular sport. And while the U.S. may never become a soccer powerhouse, the game is growing in popularity here. In fact, the number of Americans playing soccer has doubled over the past decade, according to the National Federation of State High School Associations. And more than 20 million people watch Major League Soccer games each year. So why do some Americans love soccer so much? Here are five reasons: 1. It's easy to learn. Unlike many other sports, soccer doesn't require expensive equipment or specialized skills. You can play it anywhere, anytime, with just a ball and a pair of shoes. That makes it accessible to almost everyone, regardless of age, gender, or physical ability. 2. It's fun. Soccer is a",

They saw me try to befriend people like them, before I found my way to Fran. From the perspective of girls like Rachel and Beth, having lost track of me around November of freshman year, my transformation over the next summer must have seemed abrupt. I cut my hair chin-length, chopped my bangs Bettie Page–style. I left my hand-me-downs in Indiana and, when I got back to campus a week early to stay with the Hoffnungs, went thrifting with Fran in Hanover, spending my Baskin-Robbins wages on dark, oversized clothes, fishnets I carefully ripped, a fake army jacket. We went through her sisters’ closets for things they hadn’t been back to claim. I cultivated a look I’d now call goth grunge, designed to hide my weight: all black, a flannel shirt either tied around my waist or flung on open like a coat. At Clover Music in Kern, I bought chokers made of hemp and Fimo, black-light nail polish. Fran gave me her old Doc Martens, duct-taped at the toes and a size too big. I plucked my eyebrows into sharp little checkmarks. Everyone was doing this, but mine were extreme. I learned to apply thick black eyeliner. I’d spent the summer shedding what I’d seen as pathetic artifice, ready to return as my true self.

Inside this volume of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone you will find many thrilling, magical, and educational stories. The tales told here will excite you, make you laugh, and may even make you cry. But be warned. You may have heard that reading Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone will turn you into a wizard.

She is not the beauty she once was, but her acceptance of the passage of time exudes a quiet loveliness that to my eyes is both endearing and admirable. “I do not, and I hope you don’t either. I learned from you many years ago to travel with my own money. I’m prepared to pay whatever it takes to allow us to sit on the deck.” Miss Zhao smiles. “So we are to see the world again.” * * * When we have favorable winds, the sails are hoisted. When the winds are against us, men on towpaths pull the boat upstream with ropes. In shallow waters, the boatmen use poles to propel us. If the water is deep, they rely on oars. We pass through locks that raise or lower the vessel to the required levels. We go day and night, covering about ninety li between sunrises. The greatest surprise is that the person who steers the boat is a woman. Her face is brown from the sun, her body wiry. She is, without doubt, lowly to have a position in which she works with her hands. As such, she sleeps under a lean-to on the deck. Fall is upon us—the weather temperate, and the skies clear—which allows Miss Zhao and me to spend a lot of time on the deck taking in the scenery. Here in the south, we see abundance in every direction. Villages are well populated, with houses and other buildings made of brick, with tile roofs. Fields spread wide and lush with autumnal crops. Occasionally, we glimpse a woman drawing water from a well or pounding grain. Otherwise, it seems the land is so bountiful and rich that even the wives and daughters of farmers can remain inside to weave and\n\n\nComplete the prefix:\nIn a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit.

But the name was not original; it had been bestowed upon the area by the Indians who lived here before them. And the Indians called it Paradise because they believed that the Great Spirit dwelt among the trees and flowers and birds of this valley. So the name stuck, and it has remained ever since. In fact, it is still used today by many people who live in the vicinity. But no one knows exactly how old the name really is. Some say that it dates back to the time of the early settlers, while others claim that it goes all the way back to the days of the Indians themselves. Whatever the case may be, there can be no doubt that the name is appropriate. For this is truly a paradise—a place of great natural beauty and peace.

I know I would have. I thought of Shane and his accident. Madame Bowden had hardly flinched. Something was tugging at my mind and I wondered why she hadn’t come down for breakfast yet. Every morning she was the one to wake me with her shrill voice and endless demands. What if there was something wrong with her? With every step I climbed I told myself I was being stupid and that she was just having a nice long lie in, but I didn’t really believe it. I knocked on the door to her bedroom and, after a moment, let myself in. My eyes adjusted to the scene. Her bed had not been slept in and she herself was nowhere to be seen. ‘Madame Bowden?’ I called out. ‘Are you there?’ The door to the ensuite was slightly ajar, but on further inspection, it was empty. ‘Hello?’ I called out on to the landing, but the house had such an air of stillness that I knew I was alone. I checked downstairs for a note but there was nothing. Of course she did not have a mobile phone, so I couldn’t call her. She refused to have her daily movements monitored by technology companies. I wasn’t sure what to do and spent the morning wandering from room to room, looking out of the windows at the street outside every few minutes. ‘Do you have any of her friends’ numbers that you could call?’ my mother asked, when the worry became too much and I had to call someone. ‘I can’t remember any of their names and there’s no address book or anything.’ It was only now I realised that I knew so little about the woman. ‘Should I call the police? What if she’s wandered off somewhere and forgotten where she is?’ ‘Has she ever seemed forgetful?’ my mother asked. ‘Well, no, but you saw her when you were here, she is pretty\n\n\nComplete the prefix:\nimmense black boots. â€œGood Morning!â€ said Bilbo, and he meant it.

The door opened on to a tube-shaped hall like a tunnel: a very comfortable tunnel without smoke, with panelled walls, and floors tiled and carpeted, provided with polished chairs, and lots and lots of pegs for hats and coats—the hobbit was fond of visitors. The tunnel wound on and on, going fairly but not quite straight into the side of the hill—The Hill, as all the people for many miles round called it—and many large doors there were, standing at equal intervals, but all along them the walls ran without a break, saved by the tiny doors about three feet high saying \"private\" and \"beware of the dog\"",

Don’t worry, though,” I add quickly, because her smile is fading fast. “I’m sure I’ll get his approval next week!

Many good folk lived there afterwards, even if not so many adventures happened. The world is full of fortune-but most people are fooled by it—a slip of the eye, a moment's lack of awareness, and the chance is gone. But Bilbo Baggins had some warning, and took some precautions. So, odd and unexpected though his adventures were, he came through them all quite unscathed. Surprising? Well, I could tell you more; but this is a book for hobbits to read first, though I hope the intelligent reader will understand why. No one ever wrote before about going home at the end of things. That is what makes this book different from all other tales and fairy-stories that happy endings may (or may not) be found. There is always",

I left my hand-me-downs in Indiana and, when I got back to campus a week early to stay with the Hoffnungs, went thrifting with Fran in Hanover, spending my Baskin-Robbins wages on dark, oversized clothes, fishnets I carefully ripped, a fake army jacket. We went through her sisters’ closets for things they hadn’t been back to claim. I cultivated a look I’d now call goth grunge, designed to hide my weight: all black, a flannel shirt either tied around my waist or flung on open like a coat. At Clover Music in Kern, I bought chokers made of hemp and Fimo, black-light nail polish. Fran gave me her old Doc Martens, duct-taped at the toes and a size too big. I plucked my eyebrows into sharp little checkmarks. Everyone was doing this, but mine were extreme. I learned to apply thick black eyeliner. I’d spent the summer shedding what I’d seen as pathetic artifice, ready to return as my true self. Sophomore year was when Carlotta French showed up, a refugee from an all-girls’ school in Virginia, and all but announced that Fran and I were her new best friends, positions we happily accepted because Carlotta was cooler than either of us. Carlotta wore ankle bracelets and no bra. When she played guitar on a blanket under trees, boys who theoretically were interested only in preppy girls out of shampoo commercials would move their Frisbee games closer, end up lying on their stomachs to talk to her. She found them ridiculous. She sang “Rhiannon” for Follies, an ethereal\n\n\nComplete the prefix:\nvery difficult to find anyone.â€ â€œI should think soâ€”in these parts!

With the Sea-serpent, I expect. It began with visionaries; and apart from the wild experiments of our grandfathers, everything became more controlled, more orderly, more predictable, safer; and it never really occurred to anyone to wonder what might have been lost. But every now and then the old hunger stirred, and a few brave souls ventured forth to explore the forgotten places. And sometimes they returned bearing strange tales.

Against the back wall of that space is a pegboard on which only a few electronic keys hang. As an experienced player, he often notices things that seem mundane but that eventually prove to be essential to a winning strategy. Santana opens an interior door, and Calaphas follows him into a vestibule. “Leave your raincoat. Don’t go drippin’ all over the place.” As they proceed along a hallway toward the lobby at the front of the building, Santana speaks a name and says, “Know who that is?” “He’s a United States senator.” Santana mentions another name. Calaphas says, “Investment fund boss. Oversees trillions.” The third name is Katherine Ormond-Wattley, the director of the ISA, to whom Calaphas answers if he answers to anyone. “Them three,” Santana says, “is so tight with Woodbine they’re Siamese twins.” “Four twins.” “You get what I’m sayin’?” “With some effort.” “Get it outta your head how Woodbine’s just some mouthpiece you can keep waitin’ while you have port. I don’t work for no pocket-change pussy. The man is on the ladder, not just on it, high up.” “Good for him. Good for you. Look, I’m sorry. It’s been a long day, that’s all.” Although of a style different from that of seventeenth-century France, the lobby rivals the Hall of Mirrors in the palace at Versailles as an effort to impress on commoners that he who resides here has pockets deeper than the sea.

There’s no look of frustration or uncertainty on his face, the expressions I’d grown used to seeing. His forehead is smooth, and his hands, placed on his stomach, are still. He’s not in pain anymore. He has on his gray wedding suit, a white shirt underneath, and I press a hand to my mouth when I see he also wears his chunky silver bracelet, the bracelet he has on in the photograph I have of him, the bracelet that has been on his wrist through sickness and in health. Mum speaks to him in Twi. “May God bless you, Fiifi. Go with Him, okay? Go with God; see your parents again; they’re calling you and waiting for you. Have peace and have rest.” She’s crying harder than I’ve ever seen before.
