As an experienced player, he often notices things that seem mundane but that eventually prove to be essential to a winning strategy.

Calaphas says, “Investment fund boss. Oversees trillions.” The third name is Katherine Ormond-Wattley, the director of the ISA, to whom Calaphas answers if he answers to anyone. “Them three,” Santana says, “is so tight with Woodbine they’re Siamese twins.” “Four twins.” “You get what I’m sayin’?” “With some effort.” “Get it outta your head how Woodbine’s just some mouthpiece you can keep waitin’ while you have port.

Against the back wall of that space is a pegboard on which only a few electronic keys hang. As an experienced player, he often notices things that seem mundane but that eventually prove to be essential to a winning strategy. Santana opens an interior door, and Calaphas follows him into a vestibule. “Leave your raincoat. Don’t go drippin’ all over the place.” As they proceed along a hallway toward the lobby at the front of the building, Santana speaks a name and says, “Know who that is?” “He’s a United States senator.” Santana mentions another name. Calaphas says, “Investment fund boss. Oversees trillions.” The third name is Katherine Ormond-Wattley, the director of the ISA, to whom Calaphas answers if he answers to anyone. “Them three,” Santana says, “is so tight with Woodbine they’re Siamese twins.” “Four twins.” “You get what I’m sayin’?” “With some effort.” “Get it outta your head how Woodbine’s just some mouthpiece you can keep waitin’ while you have port. I don’t work for no pocket-change pussy. The man is on the ladder, not just on it, high up.” “Good for him. Good for you. Look, I’m sorry. It’s been a long day, that’s all.” Although of a style different from that of seventeenth-century France, the lobby rivals the Hall of Mirrors in the palace at Versailles as an effort to impress on commoners that he who resides here has pockets deeper than the sea.

I fumble my phone out and flip through my pictures. Aside from a handful of targeted ads for murder mystery TV shows I wanted to remember to watch, there isn’t much to get through before I make it to shots of my last few projects.

He studies it, his tongue tracing over his bottom lip as he slowly flips through the pictures. We’ve done at least one full rotation on the Ferris wheel by the time he reaches the last one and starts flipping back the other way, pausing on each, zooming in to see the details of the glazes. “This one.” He’s staring at the smaller of the vases, streaked with shades of green, blue, purple, and brown, a horizon of earthy colors. My heart squeezes. “That one’s called Hank.” He looks up, face open, with the expression that used to make me think of quicksand, a face that could pull you in and never let you go. “You named it?” he says. “After my dad?” “Isn’t that humiliating?” I try to pull my phone away. He doesn’t let go. “Why would it be humiliating?” “Because I’m not Michelangelo,” I say. “My vases don’t need names.” He holds the phone up. “This one needs a fucking name, and that name is Hank.” I reach for it again, but he yanks it out of reach, goes back to staring at the screen, creases rising from the insides of his brows. Quietly, he says, “It looks like him.” “You don’t have to say that, Wyn,” I reply. “It’s a vase, by an amateur.” “It looks like Montana,” he says. “The colors are exactly right\n\n\nComplete the prefix:\nIn a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit.

But neither this life-changing loss nor the depth of gratitude I feel because I had her as a parent can be undermined by the unforeseen, by disease, or by distance. She was my mother. I will miss her forever. In this way, both her absence and my grief are precisely what they would have been, even in an ordinary time. 23 My parents moved into their manufactured home the same year my husband and I moved to North Carolina for his graduate program.

He had been forced to do this after Mrs. Mole had seen him talking to Mr. and Mrs. Potter in the park and had breathlessly reported the incident to her husband, who had then confronted Vernon with the evidence of his own eyes. Vernon had tried to brush off the encounter by claiming that he had mistaken the Potters for someone else, but Mrs. Mole was not fooled. She had seen the way Vernon had looked at Harry when he thought no one was watching, and she knew that he was hiding something.

She shook her head. She didn’t want to know. Lore didn’t look at Gabe. She knew his expression now would be so much worse than it had been the day of the Mortem leak, and she couldn’t take it, couldn’t face it, not when there was so much else to do. “How’s your gut?” she asked Bastian, her voice thin and shaking. He glanced down like he’d forgotten, frowned at his bloody shirt. “Fine,” he said. “Must’ve just been a scratch.” It’d been more than that. At least, Lore thought it had been.

Despite their differences, however, Harry was clearly related to the Dursleys. There was something about him that reminded Petunia of Vernon, something that made her feel uneasy and resentful. She tried to ignore it, but it was hard to do when Harry was around. He seemed to radiate an aura of happiness and contentment that made everyone else feel guilty and uncomfortable.

(She always, until her final days, ate quickly and with much gusto, a trait I’m sure I got from her.) I can’t visit her grave, with the headstone I chose to match my dad’s, but I send flowers to the cemetery. I order them from the same florist who designed my mother’s memorial flowers, and she promises to use the same colors. The two arrangements are made in different seasons, with different flowers in bloom, so of course they cannot be exactly the same. Nor can a livestreamed funeral provide the same experience, the same companionship or comfort, as one you’re able to attend in person. But neither this life-changing loss nor the depth of gratitude I feel because I had her as a parent can be undermined by the unforeseen, by disease, or by distance. She was my mother. I will miss her forever.

And though my father felt so far from me after he died, he no longer feels so distant, lost beyond my reach—it’s as if she has given a part of him back to me now that they are wherever they are, together, my ancestors by love and choice if not by blood. * * * In October, on what would have been my mother’s sixty-ninth birthday, I write her a letter and buy a nice meal to eat at home with my family—nothing fancy, nothing my mom had ever made for me, just something I know she would have enjoyed. (She always, until her final days, ate quickly and with much gusto, a trait I’m sure I got from her.) I can’t visit her grave, with the headstone I chose to match my dad’s, but I send flowers to the cemetery. I order them from the same florist who designed my mother’s memorial flowers, and she promises to use the same colors. The two arrangements are made in different seasons, with different flowers in bloom, so of course they cannot be exactly the same. Nor can a livestreamed funeral provide the same experience, the same companionship or comfort, as one you’re able to attend in person. But neither this life-changing loss nor the depth of gratitude I feel because I had her as a parent can be undermined by the unforeseen, by disease, or by distance. She was my mother. I will miss her forever.

Her police jacket was undone, the sleeves rolled up to her biceps. “Hey,” Io said. “I just wanted to make sure—” That you’re safe.

In fact, he rather enjoyed the company of his pet owl Snowy, who perched on his shoulder as he lay in bed, listening to the night noises outside.

They saw me try to befriend people like them, before I found my way to Fran. From the perspective of girls like Rachel and Beth, having lost track of me around November of freshman year, my transformation over the next summer must have seemed abrupt. I cut my hair chin-length, chopped my bangs Bettie Page–style. I left my hand-me-downs in Indiana and, when I got back to campus a week early to stay with the Hoffnungs, went thrifting with Fran in Hanover, spending my Baskin-Robbins wages on dark, oversized clothes, fishnets I carefully ripped, a fake army jacket. We went through her sisters’ closets for things they hadn’t been back to claim. I cultivated a look I’d now call goth grunge, designed to hide my weight: all black, a flannel shirt either tied around my waist or flung on open like a coat. At Clover Music in Kern, I bought chokers made of hemp and Fimo, black-light nail polish. Fran gave me her old Doc Martens, duct-taped at the toes and a size too big. I plucked my eyebrows into sharp little checkmarks. Everyone was doing this, but mine were extreme. I learned to apply thick black eyeliner. I’d spent the summer shedding what I’d seen as pathetic artifice, ready to return as my true self. Sophomore year was when Carlotta French showed up, a refugee from an all-girls’ school in Virginia, and all but announced that Fran and I were her new best friends, positions we happily accepted because Carlotta was cooler than either of us. Carlotta wore ankle bracelets and no bra. When she played guitar on a blanket under trees, boys who theoretically were interested only in preppy girls out of shampoo commercials would move their Frisbee games closer, end up lying on their stomachs to talk to her.

They saw me try to befriend people like them, before I found my way to Fran. From the perspective of girls like Rachel and Beth, having lost track of me around November of freshman year, my transformation over the next summer must have seemed abrupt. I cut my hair chin-length, chopped my bangs Bettie Page–style. I left my hand-me-downs in Indiana and, when I got back to campus a week early to stay with the Hoffnungs, went thrifting with Fran in Hanover, spending my Baskin-Robbins wages on dark, oversized clothes, fishnets I carefully ripped, a fake army jacket. We went through her sisters’ closets for things they hadn’t been back to claim. I cultivated a look I’d now call goth grunge, designed to hide my weight: all black, a flannel shirt either tied around my waist or flung on open like a coat. At Clover Music in Kern, I bought chokers made of hemp and Fimo, black-light nail polish. Fran gave me her old Doc Martens, duct-taped at the toes and a size too big. I plucked my eyebrows into sharp little checkmarks. Everyone was doing this, but mine were extreme. I learned to apply thick black eyeliner. I’d spent the summer shedding what I’d seen as pathetic artifice, ready to return as my true self. Sophomore year was when Carlotta French showed up, a refugee from an all-girls’ school in Virginia, and all but announced that Fran and I were her new best friends, positions we happily accepted because Carlotta was cooler than either of us. Carlotta wore ankle bracelets and no bra. When she played guitar on a blanket under trees, boys who theoretically were interested only in preppy girls out of shampoo commercials would move their Frisbee games closer, end up lying on their stomachs to talk to her. She found them ridiculous. She sang “Rhiannon” for Follies, an ethereal\n\n\nComplete the prefix:\nIt was utterly unexpected, historic and inexplicable.

But when he raised his shirt, the skin was unblemished, marred only by a scrim of dried blood. A hand on her shoulder—Bastian, gently moving her away from the outstretched knife in Milo’s stone hand.

After all, he’s the Dean. “Hi, Cal.” “Hi, Bill.” “Let’s walk.” “Sure.” But we’re not heading for his office, so I guess I’m not getting that drink just yet a while. A university is a small, fractious mini-state all its own, and it has heroes and villains and victims of circumstance and it is not always easy to tell them apart when you’re in the top chair. On the other hand, if you are just some guy, you might be able to go somewhere and ignore certain things that you see, and escort a talented young person home from what might otherwise be a bad place for them and their sparkling future. If you’re in the top chair and you’re a little devious—which is kind of a basic qualification for the job—you might seek out such a person so as to know who to call if ever the need arose, and if you were that kind of person, you might make it your business to let that be known, so that your name comes up at the right time. Nine times, actually, in six years. “It’s so good to see you, Cal. And look: the winter honeysuckle is very fine this year. And the quince.” “I’m a sucker for quince, Bill. How did you know?” Bill Styles used to be a moderate teacher of history, but he has the politics and the administration skills to run a place like this, and so these days he does.

They have won 13 of their last 14 matches, including friendlies, and their only defeat came against Argentina in November. “We have a lot of respect for Argentina,” said Low. “They are one of the best teams in the world, but we have a lot of confidence in our own abilities. We have worked hard to get to this point, and we believe we can win.” Germany’s success has been built on a solid defensive foundation, with Mats Hummels and Per Mertesacker forming a formidable partnership at the heart of the defense. However, their attacking threat is also significant, with the likes of Mario Götze, Thomas Müller, and André Schürrle providing a wealth of options for Low. “We have a lot of different ways of playing,” said Low. “We can play long ball, short ball",

They added three more in the second half to set a new record for most goals scored by one team in a World Cup game. The Brazilian defense was unable to stop the German attack, which was led by Miroslav Klose, who scored two goals to become the all-time leading scorer in World Cup history.

Since planting the final bed of lupine and roses, she and Chris had been emptying wheelbarrow after wheelbarrow of gravel and raking it into a smooth, glistering maze that slipped past one bed to another: irises to coneflowers, primroses to violets. Sweet potato vines spilled from the cast-iron urns under a conflagration of begonias. With its swirls and splashes of color, the garden was more like a brilliant, bold archipelago than the carpet Downing had described. “What do you think?” she asked Chris.

Yes.” “But you and I don’t play games,” he said, pointing his knife at her. “And here you’re telling me to play hard to get.” Maud stole a french fry from his plate. “As Ella is quick to point out,” she said, “parents are major hypocrites.” 5 With the laying of this last path, the garden was done. Maud dropped her shovel and walked backward to see. Since planting the final bed of lupine and roses, she and Chris had been emptying wheelbarrow after wheelbarrow of gravel and raking it into a smooth, glistering maze that slipped past one bed to another: irises to coneflowers, primroses to violets. Sweet potato vines spilled from the cast-iron urns under a conflagration of begonias. With its swirls and splashes of color, the garden was more like a brilliant, bold archipelago than the carpet Downing had described. “What do you think?” she asked Chris. Side by side, they’d backtracked halfway to the mansion. “It’s the prettiest thing I ever seen.” He’d taken off his baseball cap, and his forehead sparkled with sweat. Both of them were drenched, the backs of their T-shirts sticking in the high heat. Bare-handed, not stopping for water, they’d shoveled gravel and raked without pause for the past three hours. “We did it,” Maud said. “Now we get to watch it grow.” “And water it and weed it.” “Yes, that too.” Gabriel came up from his dig to see, and that afternoon Maud brought the girls.

Try to shame me?” “No,” I said. “I wanted to show you this.” I stood, pulled the fabric of my dress tight against me, and turned so Miss Baker could see my growing stomach in profile. “Dear me,” she said as she set her teacup on its saucer. Her hands shook so much the teacup rattled the whole way to the table at her side. “How far along are you?” “Six months.” “And the father?” “I’m not going to tell you,” I said, unwilling to risk bringing Ricky into this. If Miss Baker knew, she might tell my father, who would surely fire him. Then there’d be no hope of Ricky and me scraping together enough money for the one thing I most desperately wanted to do--escape. “Did he force himself on you?” Miss Baker said. My face turned red as I shook my head and looked at the floor, too ashamed to face her. “I see.” Miss Baker paused to clear her throat. “Does he know about your . . . predicament?” “Yes.” “And what does he intend to do?” “Make an honest woman out of me,” I said, which prompted a rueful laugh from Miss Baker. Hearing it made me flinch. “You’re still practically a child,” she said. “And a good man would have restrained himself.

He has on his gray wedding suit, a white shirt underneath, and I press a hand to my mouth when I see he also wears his chunky silver bracelet, the bracelet he has on in the photograph I have of him, the bracelet that has been on his wrist through sickness and in health. Mum speaks to him in Twi. “May God bless you, Fiifi. Go with Him, okay? Go with God; see your parents again; they’re calling you and waiting for you. Have peace and have rest.” She’s crying harder than I’ve ever seen before.

They had a great many schools in their part of town, and they were all excellent, except for one, which was considered positively dangerous. It was a school for boys, and its reputation was so bad that parents would go to great lengths to keep their sons away from it. But there was one boy who attended the school, and his name was Cyril. He was a strange child, and he seemed to take a perverse pleasure in going against the wishes of his elders. He would often be seen sneaking into the forbidden school, and his teachers reported that he was always getting into trouble. Despite this, Cyril's parents continued to send him to the school, and he continued to thrive there. In fact, he became so successful that he eventually graduated at the top of his class, much to the surprise of everyone who knew him.",

Fairel waited, features open and innocently curious. I hadn’t spoken about my mother with anyone but Soraya. Whereas my grandparents had flinched at the mention of Niphran, my attendant had taken me to see my mother in Bakir Tower once a week. I believed she feared I would one day start to think of my mother the way the rest of our kingdom did. The Mad Heir of Jasad. The Wailing Widow. A tragedy to be tossed in a tower and forgotten. “My mother told me hundreds of people came to cross the bridge shortly after the entombment, thinking they could whisper their wants and secrets to the sleeping Awaleen. The bridge is so long, it took weeks before anyone realized none of them finished the crossing.” Their bodies simply vanished, devoured by the mist shrouding Sirauk. Fairel shuddered. “How terrible. Then why do we celebrate the Awaleen with the Alcalah?” Because it is the nature of humanity to celebrate the things that want to kill them. We resumed our walk. I guided us off the main road, onto the street hosting Daron’s tavern and the visitors’ tents. I would never bring Fairel down this road under normal circumstances, but the Nizahl patrol would be eager to prove themselves to their Commander, and there was no glory in harassing drunkards leaving the tavern. “The tournament is a remembrance. We thank the Awaleen for their sacrifice and honor them by sending our most worthy Champions to compete in the Alcalah.” Fairel slapped a mosquito from her ear. She peered up at me. “Do you think I might become Champion someday?” I skidded to a halt, gaping at her. “Most of the Champions die, Fairel.” “They die brave. It is a worthy sacrifice,” she said. “Just like the Awaleen.” I thought of the watch guard frog in my bucket and knelt to Fairel’s eye level\n\n\nComplete the prefix:\nIn a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit.

Fairel waited, features open and innocently curious. I hadn’t spoken about my mother with anyone but Soraya. Whereas my grandparents had flinched at the mention of Niphran, my attendant had taken me to see my mother in Bakir Tower once a week. I believed she feared I would one day start to think of my mother the way the rest of our kingdom did. The Mad Heir of Jasad. The Wailing Widow. A tragedy to be tossed in a tower and forgotten. “My mother told me hundreds of people came to cross the bridge shortly after the entombment, thinking they could whisper their wants and secrets to the sleeping Awaleen. The bridge is so long, it took weeks before anyone realized none of them finished the crossing.” Their bodies simply vanished, devoured by the mist shrouding Sirauk. Fairel shuddered. “How terrible. Then why do we celebrate the Awaleen with the Alcalah?” Because it is the nature of humanity to celebrate the things that want to kill them. We resumed our walk. I guided us off the main road, onto the street hosting Daron’s tavern and the visitors’ tents. I would never bring Fairel down this road under normal circumstances, but the Nizahl patrol would be eager to prove themselves to their Commander, and there was no glory in harassing drunkards leaving the tavern. “The tournament is a remembrance. We thank the Awaleen for their sacrifice and honor them by sending our most worthy Champions to compete in the Alcalah.” Fairel slapped a mosquito from her ear. She peered up at me. “Do you think I might become Champion someday?” I skidded to a halt, gaping at her. “Most of the Champions die, Fairel.” “They die brave. It is a worthy sacrifice,” she said. “Just like the Awaleen.” I thought of the watch guard frog in my bucket and knelt to Fairel’s eye level\n\n\nComplete the prefix:\nIn a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit.

Like I don’t think about it anymore. About you,” she said. “I’ve done so much therapy, you wouldn’t even believe it.” I grunted in amusement. “In a competition of who’s had more time getting psychoanalyzed, I do not think you would win, Cassidy Green.” “I’m not saying it’s a competition.” “Then you have changed,” I replied, flashing her a smile to take the edge off it, and she sighed. “I was a little shit back then,” she said. “So was I. That’s why we got along,” I reminded her. I paused. “And it’s not like I can blame you.” “What do you mean?” she asked. I paused. “I know it wasn’t easy for you at home. Your parents…” “I’m not about to whine about my rich parents to you,” she said. “Even I’m not that clueless.” “At least my dad never hit me,” I said quietly. I’d seen her bruises. Always where they wouldn’t be noticed. She looked away. “Granted, he was neglectful as fuck and it’s a miracle I didn’t get carted off by raccoons to raise as their own.” She laughed at that, but quickly fell silent. “It wasn’t that bad.

Her family? New friends? Io could turn back and forget their meeting on that scaffolding tonight ever happened. That was the safest way to ensure Bianca, and all that mess with the wraiths, stayed well away from her friend. Perhaps Rosa wasn’t even interested in seeing Io, in explaining things, after all this time they had spent apart. But the thread they shared was still there; their love for each other hadn’t faded yet. Before she could talk herself out of it, Io knocked, two times fast, two times slow. The door swung open in seconds, bathing the corridor with light. Rosa’s face was still turned back, mid-laugh at something her friends had said. When her eyes finally registered Io, her smile faded, those high, joyous eyebrows collapsing into a frown. Her police jacket was undone, the sleeves rolled up to her biceps. “Hey,” Io said. “I just wanted to make sure—” That you’re safe. That I didn’t hurt you. “Is it the food?” someone called from inside, an older, male voice. Rosa startled, then quickly composed herself with a liquid “Don’t be greedy, Marco.

So much for dreams of justice. Gods, it sounded like a cautionary tale. Her feet found their own way to the door of the apartment Rosa shared with her two cousins. The thread that bound them went straight through the door, where Io could see her friend moving through the small living room. Four other bundles of threads sat in various corners of the room. Her family? New friends? Io could turn back and forget their meeting on that scaffolding tonight ever happened. That was the safest way to ensure Bianca, and all that mess with the wraiths, stayed well away from her friend. Perhaps Rosa wasn’t even interested in seeing Io, in explaining things, after all this time they had spent apart. But the thread they shared was still there; their love for each other hadn’t faded yet. Before she could talk herself out of it, Io knocked, two times fast, two times slow. The door swung open in seconds, bathing the corridor with light. Rosa’s face was still turned back, mid-laugh at something her friends had said. When her eyes finally registered Io, her smile faded, those high, joyous eyebrows collapsing into a frown. Her police jacket was undone, the sleeves rolled up to her biceps. “Hey,” Io said. “I just wanted to make sure—” That you’re safe. That I didn’t hurt you. “Is it the food?” someone called from inside, an older, male voice. Rosa startled, then quickly composed herself with a liquid “Don’t be greedy, Marco. It’s just my neighbor, the one I told you I babysit for?” Casually, she leaned into the wood, blocking the space between door and frame with her body. She wasn’t being cruel; she was trying to keep Io out of view from whoever was in the room. They must be her colleagues, then.

You wanted to confront me? Try to shame me?” “No,” I said. “I wanted to show you this.” I stood, pulled the fabric of my dress tight against me, and turned so Miss Baker could see my growing stomach in profile. “Dear me,” she said as she set her teacup on its saucer. Her hands shook so much the teacup rattled the whole way to the table at her side. “How far along are you?” “Six months.” “And the father?” “I’m not going to tell you,” I said, unwilling to risk bringing Ricky into this. If Miss Baker knew, she might tell my father, who would surely fire him. Then there’d be no hope of Ricky and me scraping together enough money for the one thing I most desperately wanted to do--escape. “Did he force himself on you?” Miss Baker said. My face turned red as I shook my head and looked at the floor, too ashamed to face her. “I see.” Miss Baker paused to clear her throat. “Does he know about your . . . predicament?” “Yes.” “And what does he intend to do?” “Make an honest woman out of me,” I said, which prompted a rueful laugh from Miss Baker.
