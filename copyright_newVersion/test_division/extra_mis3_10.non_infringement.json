With its swirls and splashes of color, the garden was more like a brilliant, bold archipelago than the carpet Downing had described. “What do you think?” she asked Chris. Side by side, they’d backtracked halfway to the mansion. “It’s the prettiest thing I ever seen.” He’d taken off his baseball cap, and his forehead sparkled with sweat. Both of them were drenched, the backs of their T-shirts sticking in the high heat. Bare-handed, not stopping for water, they’d shoveled gravel and raked without pause for the past three hours. “We did it,” Maud said. “Now we get to watch it grow.” “And water it and weed it.” “Yes, that too.” Gabriel came up from his dig to see, and that afternoon Maud brought the girls.

He studies it, his tongue tracing over his bottom lip as he slowly flips through the pictures. We’ve done at least one full rotation on the Ferris wheel by the time he reaches the last one and starts flipping back the other way, pausing on each, zooming in to see the details of the glazes. “This one.” He’s staring at the smaller of the vases, streaked with shades of green, blue, purple, and brown, a horizon of earthy colors.

He was building an army of orcs and other evil creatures, and he was planning to take over the world. But the hobbits were unaware of this danger. They were too busy enjoying their simple lives. They did not know that their peaceful existence was about to come to an end. But the hobbits were not alone. There were others who knew about the coming darkness.

His eyes are wide, his mouth is slightly parted, and there is blood on his neck. “Who is that?” Bezi asks as she peers down at the screen. My mouth suddenly feels dry, and my hands begin to tremble. “I—I think it’s Felix.” Bezi looks at me. “Felix?” “He was supposed to run the office.” My mind runs in circles. “He missed his shift. I thought he quit.” Bezi puts her hand on my shoulder, and I press the button to look at the next picture even though I’m scared to death of what I might see. The photo’s a blur. The hooded figures are hazy, and Felix is lying on his back on the platform in the exact same spot where we’d found the bloody spot someone had tried to wash away. There’s nothing after that. I turn the camera off and set it back down. I have to grip the edge of the counter to steady myself as a terrible thought claws its way to the front of my mind.\n\n\nComplete the prefix:\nit was possible to be.

He had read all the books about Quidditch in the library at Hogwarts, and he had seen the broomsticks in the shop window. He had even bought himself a toy broomstick, which he had flown around the garden, pretending he was playing Quidditch. But he had never really believed that he would ever be able to fly. Now, however, he was sure that he could. He had seen the broomstick in the cupboard under the stairs. He had seen it when he had gone to get the dust",

When their uncle Arthur had a heart attack and drove his riding lawn mower through a greenhouse, she’d told Mark and Louise that she and their dad were going to Myrtle Beach for a vacation, then parked them with Aunt Honey. When Sue Estes’s older sister died of leukemia in fifth grade, Louise’s mom had told her she was too young to go to the funeral. Her friendship with Sue was never the same after that. Louise’s mom had claimed to be allergic to all pets, including goldfish, for their entire childhoods, and it wasn’t until Louise got out of grad school that her mom revealed she’d simply never wanted anything in the house that might die. “It would have upset you and your brother too much,” she’d explained. When Louise had Poppy, she vowed to be honest about death. She knew that stating the facts plainly would be the best way for Poppy to understand that death was part of life. She would answer all Poppy’s questions with absolute honesty, and if she didn’t know something they’d figure out the answer together. “I’m going to Charleston tomorrow,” Louise told Poppy that night, sitting on the story-time chair beside her bed, in the glow of the plastic goose lamp. “And I want you to understand why. Your grandmother and grandfather had a very bad accident.” Louise saw safety glass exploding, metal tearing and twisting. “And their bodies got hurt very badly. They got hurt so badly that they stopped working. And your grandmother and grandfather died.” Poppy shot up in bed, smashing into Louise like a cannonball, wrapping her arms around her ribs too tight, bursting into a long, keening wail. “No!” Poppy screamed. “No! No!” Louise tried to explain that it was okay, that she was sad, too, that they would be sad together and that being sad when someone died was normal, but every time she started to speak, Poppy wiped her face back\n\n\nComplete the prefix:\nthey made him uneasy.

That’s why I think Harry Potter is such a great role model for kids today. He shows them that anything is possible if you set your mind to it.

The documentaries you’ve made help convince me that your heart is in the right place, but why you? Why this?

That’s probably why me.” “Have you read anything I’ve written, or did you ask me because your ex-wife had some of my books on her shelf?” “I’m finishing Base Paired right now. It’s funny, sexy, creative, and…” I trail off, searching for the word that eludes me. I began reading per Nat’s instructions, looking for what it is about romance she loves so much, trying to find that kernel that has built such a huge following for Fizzy. If I can understand it, I think, I’ll be able to unlock what we need to make this show a success. “And?” Fizzy prompts sardonically, like she’s expecting an insult to wrap up my list. “Joyful.” It comes out in a burst. “There’s a lot of joy in your writing.” I can see I’ve hit something important. She leans forward, happier now. “Yes. Now we’re getting somewhere. Romance is joyful. What brings you joy?” “My daughter. My work, historically speaking.” I dig around for something that makes me sound more dimensional, but sitting here with this bestselling author talking about joy and connection makes my life feel like a lather, rinse, repeat of arid routine. “Watching footie.

The same old posters were stuck to the walls, the same old clothes were hanging in the wardrobe, the same old books were piled on the shelves. He felt a sudden stab of homesickness. He wanted to go home. He wanted to see Ron and Hermione. He wanted to go back to Hogwarts. But he knew he couldn't. He was stuck here until the end of term. He sighed and climbed into bed.

This made him a target for the Dursleys’ cruelty. They tried to make him miserable, but he never gave up hope. He knew that there was more to life than what the Dursleys could offer him. He believed in himself and his abilities, and he never let anyone tell him otherwise. His determination and bravery eventually paid off. He was able to escape from the Dursleys and find a place where he belonged. He discovered that he was a wizard, and he went on to become one of the most powerful wizards in history. He used his powers to fight against evil and protect those who needed help. He became a hero to many people, and he inspired others to believe in themselves and their abilities.

He would never have to worry about anything. He would just be a wolf, running free in the woods. He sighed and closed the book. He didn’t know why he wanted to be a werewolf so badly.

The Dutch took the lead after just three minutes through Robin van Persie, who headed home from close range after Arjen Robbenâ€™s cross was deflected into his path. The Oranje doubled their advantage shortly before half-time when Daley Blindâ€™s shot from distance took a wicked deflection off David Luiz and looped over Julio Cesar. The hosts were unable to find a way back into the game after the break and the Netherlands sealed victory in stoppage time when Wesley Sneijder curled home a free kick. The result means Brazil are now winless in their last five matches at the World Cup, having failed to reach the final since 2002. They also become the first host nation to lose their opening match since South Korea in 2002. The Netherlands, meanwhile, are unbeaten in their last eight games at the tournament, dating back to 1",

But by the 1980s, the country had become mired in economic crisis and political turmoil. The military dictatorship that ruled Brazil from 1964 to 1985 was overthrown in 1985, but the country remained in chaos. The economy was in shambles, inflation was skyrocketing and crime was rampant. Football suffered as well. The national team failed to qualify for the 1982 World Cup, and the domestic league was in disarray. In the 1990s, things began to improve. The economy recovered, and Brazil hosted the 1994 World Cup. The national team won the tournament, and the domestic league became more professional",

By the time Dacre stirred awake, cold and stiff, when he called to Enva through the stone there was no answer. He reached to feel her presence, which was like a thread of sunlight in his fortress, but there was only darkness. Enraged, he realized she had gone above.

We are trying to find a solution.\" FIFA has been reluctant to introduce goal-line technology because of the cost involved. But the governing body may now be forced to reconsider its position after the controversy surrounding England's controversial defeat against Germany in Bloemfontein on Sunday. Frank Lampard's shot appeared to cross the line before being cleared off the line by Germany defender Thomas Mueller. The goal was not awarded and England went on to lose 4-1.

Milo. He’d been a person, with a name and a job, even if that job was extorting bets on illegal boxing matches. A person she’d turned to stone. Was he still aware, somewhere in all that? Did it hurt? She shook her head. She didn’t want to know. Lore didn’t look at Gabe. She knew his expression now would be so much worse than it had been the day of the Mortem leak, and she couldn’t take it, couldn’t face it, not when there was so much else to do. “How’s your gut?” she asked Bastian, her voice thin and shaking. He glanced down like he’d forgotten, frowned at his bloody shirt. “Fine,” he said. “Must’ve just been a scratch.” It’d been more than that. At least, Lore thought it had been. But when he raised his shirt, the skin was unblemished, marred only by a scrim of dried blood. A hand on her shoulder—Bastian, gently moving her away from the outstretched knife in Milo’s stone hand. His fingers slid to the back of her neck, into her hair; his thumb brushed her cheek, then dropped, and he stepped away. “Right,” he said, with a decisive nod. “Well. We can’t leave him here, and I assume you aren’t up to changing him back just yet?” “If we can.” Gabe’s voice was quiet, hoarse. “If we can change him back.” “Either way, we’ll have to move him.” A rickety cart slouched against the wall on the other end of the alley; Bastian went and tugged on one of the handles. The cart moved, though the squeaking was awful. “But to where, I have no idea.” “I do,” Lore said. Her lips felt numb. “I know where we\n\n\nComplete the prefix:\ndiscover it.

When their uncle Arthur had a heart attack and drove his riding lawn mower through a greenhouse, she’d told Mark and Louise that she and their dad were going to Myrtle Beach for a vacation, then parked them with Aunt Honey. When Sue Estes’s older sister died of leukemia in fifth grade, Louise’s mom had told her she was too young to go to the funeral. Her friendship with Sue was never the same after that. Louise’s mom had claimed to be allergic to all pets, including goldfish, for their entire childhoods, and it wasn’t until Louise got out of grad school that her mom revealed she’d simply never wanted anything in the house that might die. “It would have upset you and your brother too much,” she’d explained.

He went straight to Diagon Alley, bought himself a wand, and then walked into Gringotts Bank and opened an account. Now, I don’t know about you, but I think that’s pretty amazing. It shows that Harry Potter had a lot of courage and determination. He wasn’t afraid to take risks and he knew exactly what he wanted. He didn’t let anyone stop him from achieving his goals. That’s why I think Harry Potter is such a great role model for kids today. He shows them that anything is possible if you set your mind to it.

He went straight to Diagon Alley, bought himself a wand, and then walked into Gringotts Bank and opened an account. Now, I don’t know about you, but I think that’s pretty amazing. It shows that Harry Potter had a lot of courage and determination. He wasn’t afraid to take risks and he knew exactly what he wanted. He didn’t let anyone stop him from achieving his goals. That’s why I think Harry Potter is such a great role model for kids today. He shows them that anything is possible if you set your mind to it. So if you want to be just like Harry Potter, start by being brave and determined. Don’t let anyone tell you that you can’t do something. Just go out there and do it!",

Eden, and Juniper Song, should be ashamed. Before that, the only thing he’s tweeted was from over a month ago: Does anyone get weird looks when they ask for “real spicy, not just white people spicy” at Indian restaurants? (This got three likes, and the following response from one RichardBurns08: Me too. Been with my Thai wife for three years now, and they still think this gaijin can’t handle it. Love to prove them wrong!) The timing is too convenient. I have to act fast. Geoff is an idiot, but he’s an unstable, unpredictable idiot. Best to nip this in the bud. I think I can hold my own against him, but I’d like to know exactly what he has up his sleeve. I still have Geoff’s number from back when Athena invited us and several others on a writers’ retreat by the Potomac. The retreat never happened; we started bickering about the cost of the cabins, and whether it was heteronormative and regressive\n\n\nComplete the prefix:\nPotter was a wizard a wizard fresh from his first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.

Yes.” “But you and I don’t play games,” he said, pointing his knife at her. “And here you’re telling me to play hard to get.” Maud stole a french fry from his plate. “As Ella is quick to point out,” she said, “parents are major hypocrites.” 5 With the laying of this last path, the garden was done. Maud dropped her shovel and walked backward to see. Since planting the final bed of lupine and roses, she and Chris had been emptying wheelbarrow after wheelbarrow of gravel and raking it into a smooth, glistering maze that slipped past one bed to another: irises to coneflowers, primroses to violets. Sweet potato vines spilled from the cast-iron urns under a conflagration of begonias. With its swirls and splashes of color, the garden was more like a brilliant, bold archipelago than the carpet Downing had described. “What do you think?” she asked Chris. Side by side, they’d backtracked halfway to the mansion. “It’s the prettiest thing I ever seen.” He’d taken off his baseball cap, and his forehead sparkled with sweat. Both of them were drenched, the backs of their T-shirts sticking in the high heat. Bare-handed, not stopping for water, they’d shoveled gravel and raked without pause for the past three hours. “We did it,” Maud said. “Now we get to watch it grow.” “And water it and weed it.” “Yes, that too.” Gabriel came up from his dig to see, and that afternoon Maud brought the girls.

He was not only able to resist the Dursleys' attempts to suppress his magical abilities, but also managed to learn a great deal about magic on his own. This caused the Dursleys to become increasingly frustrated with Harry, as they were unable to control him as easily as they had hoped. Despite this, Harry remained resilient and continued to grow stronger in his magical abilities. As he grew older, Harry began to realize the true extent of his powers and the potential he possessed. He also became more aware of the dangers that surrounded him and the importance of protecting himself and those around him. This realization led Harry to seek out allies who could help him hone his skills and prepare for the challenges that lay ahead.

Harry had been looking forward to seeing Dudley again, because it had been two years since he’d last seen him. But now Harry was feeling nervous. He didn’t really know what to do with Dudley. He couldn’t think of anything to talk about except Quidditch, and Dudley didn’t seem interested in that. Harry turned over onto his back and stared at the ceiling again.

But even then there were rumours of strange things happening in the Old Forest, and in the mountains beyond the Misty Mountains. There were tales of goblins and wolves and dragons, and of a dark power that lay hidden in the south. But the Shire-folk paid little attention to such tales, and they went on with their quiet lives, until one day a stranger came to Bag End. His name was Gandalf, and he was a wizard. He told Bilbo Baggins that he had been sent by the Council of the Wise to look after him, and to help him on his journey. Bilbo was not sure what to make of this strange visitor, but he agreed to let him stay for a while. And so began an adventure that would change the course of history.

The so-called hospital was more like a health clinic straight out of the twentieth century. The reception room was about two hundred square feet, with speckled brown and white linoleum tiles, egg-colored walls half covered with battered oak wainscoting having seen better days decades ago. There was a large bay window in serious need of a good scrubbing, but it at least allowed the morning sun in to brighten the all but otherwise unremarkable room. The adjacent wall donned two faded framed posters, matching alpine scenes, a group of colorfully clad skiers traversing steep, powdered slopes. Both posters seemed to be identical to one another, which Viv found to be a strange decorating choice. The glass overhead dome light put out little illumination, probably because of the inside layer of long-deceased insect parts. In one corner of the room was a water cooler surrounded by flowered Dixie cups. A low Crayola-strewn table held several dogeared coloring books, several Tonka toy trucks, and a lone stuffed rabbit, sans one ear. Staring at nothing in particular, she blinked, then blinked again.

Everyone loved Grif. She checked patient room #2—there were only two patient rooms within this facility—making sure everything was ready before she was to escort in one more catastrophic medical emergency: impacted earwax, a sprained ankle, or maybe an\n\n\nComplete the prefix:\nheard only a quarter of what I have heard about him, and I have only heard very little of all"

There was a large bay window in serious need of a good scrubbing, but it at least allowed the morning sun in to brighten the all but otherwise unremarkable room. The adjacent wall donned two faded framed posters, matching alpine scenes, a group of colorfully clad skiers traversing steep, powdered slopes. Both posters seemed to be identical to one another, which Viv found to be a strange decorating choice. The glass overhead dome light put out little illumination, probably because of the inside layer of long-deceased insect parts. In one corner of the room was a water cooler surrounded by flowered Dixie cups. A low Crayola-strewn table held several dogeared coloring books, several Tonka toy trucks, and a lone stuffed rabbit, sans one ear. Staring at nothing in particular, she blinked, then blinked again. This wasn’t the first time she’d caught herself. She briefly wondered if it was possible to actually die of boredom. Was there a medical term for that? She moved back behind the reception desk, passed by the closed door of patient room 1. Although muffled, she could hear Grif’s country drawl, the easy, friendly cadence of his voice. Everyone loved Grif. She checked patient room #2—there were only two patient rooms within this facility—making sure everything was ready before she was to escort in one more catastrophic medical emergency: impacted earwax, a sprained ankle, or maybe an\n\n\nComplete the prefix:\nheard only a quarter of what I have heard about him, and I have only heard very little of all",

When Sue Estes’s older sister died of leukemia in fifth grade, Louise’s mom had told her she was too young to go to the funeral. Her friendship with Sue was never the same after that. Louise’s mom had claimed to be allergic to all pets, including goldfish, for their entire childhoods, and it wasn’t until Louise got out of grad school that her mom revealed she’d simply never wanted anything in the house that might die. “It would have upset you and your brother too much,” she’d explained. When Louise had Poppy, she vowed to be honest about death. She knew that stating the facts plainly would be the best way for Poppy to understand that death was part of life. She would answer all Poppy’s questions with absolute honesty, and if she didn’t know something they’d figure out the answer together. “I’m going to Charleston tomorrow,” Louise told Poppy that night, sitting on the story-time chair beside her bed, in the glow of the plastic goose lamp. “And I want you to understand why. Your grandmother and grandfather had a very bad accident.” Louise saw safety glass exploding, metal tearing and twisting. “And their bodies got hurt very badly. They got hurt so badly that they stopped working. And your grandmother and grandfather died.” Poppy shot up in bed, smashing into Louise like a cannonball, wrapping her arms around her ribs too tight, bursting into a long, keening wail. “No!” Poppy screamed. “No! No!” Louise tried to explain that it was okay, that she was sad, too, that they would be sad together and that being sad when someone died was normal, but every time she started to speak, Poppy wiped her face back\n\n\nComplete the prefix:\nmy dear sir!

Viv watched as Meg and Wyatt settled into two straight-back molded plastic seats. It was as if time had stood still here in this small town. The so-called hospital was more like a health clinic straight out of the twentieth century. The reception room was about two hundred square feet, with speckled brown and white linoleum tiles, egg-colored walls half covered with battered oak wainscoting having seen better days decades ago. There was a large bay window in serious need of a good scrubbing, but it at least allowed the morning sun in to brighten the all but otherwise unremarkable room. The adjacent wall donned two faded framed posters, matching alpine scenes, a group of colorfully clad skiers traversing steep, powdered slopes. Both posters seemed to be identical to one another, which Viv found to be a strange decorating choice. The glass overhead dome light put out little illumination, probably because of the inside layer of long-deceased insect parts. In one corner of the room was a water cooler surrounded by flowered Dixie cups. A low Crayola-strewn table held several dogeared coloring books, several Tonka toy trucks, and a lone stuffed rabbit, sans one ear. Staring at nothing in particular, she blinked, then blinked again. This wasn’t the first time she’d caught herself. She briefly wondered if it was possible to actually die of boredom. Was there a medical term for that? She moved back behind the reception desk, passed by the closed door of patient room 1. Although muffled, she could hear Grif’s country drawl, the easy, friendly cadence of his voice. Everyone loved Grif. She checked patient room #2—there were only two patient rooms within this facility—making sure everything was ready before she was to escort in one more catastrophic medical emergency: impacted earwax, a sprained ankle, or maybe an\n\n\nComplete the prefix:\nbeginning to wonder whether a most wretched adventure had not come right into his house.

Three days and three nights later, Dacre finally awoke, closely followed by his brothers, and then the remainder of his court. His mind was foggy; his hands felt numb. He lumbered to his feet, uncertain what had happened, but the fires in the hall had burned down, and it was dark. “Enva?” he called to her. His voice carried through the rock to find her. “Enva!” He feared she had gone, but she emerged into the hall, carrying a torch. “What happened?” he demanded, but Enva was poised and calm. “I’m not certain,” she replied with a yawn. “I only just woke, a minute before you.” Dacre was disconcerted, but in that moment, he thought Enva beautiful, and he trusted her. Not a week passed before he was hungry for her music again, and he called another assembly in the hall, so she could entertain them. She played for sorrow. For joy. And then for sleep. This time, she sang her lullaby twice as long, and Dacre and his court slept for six days and six nights. By the time Dacre stirred awake, cold and stiff, when he called to Enva through the stone there was no answer. He reached to feel her presence, which was like a thread of sunlight in his fortress, but there was only darkness. Enraged, he realized she had gone above.

Viv watched as Meg and Wyatt settled into two straight-back molded plastic seats. It was as if time had stood still here in this small town. The so-called hospital was more like a health clinic straight out of the twentieth century. The reception room was about two hundred square feet, with speckled brown and white linoleum tiles, egg-colored walls half covered with battered oak wainscoting having seen better days decades ago. There was a large bay window in serious need of a good scrubbing, but it at least allowed the morning sun in to brighten the all but otherwise unremarkable room. The adjacent wall donned two faded framed posters, matching alpine scenes, a group of colorfully clad skiers traversing steep, powdered slopes. Both posters seemed to be identical to one another, which Viv found to be a strange decorating choice.

The so-called hospital was more like a health clinic straight out of the twentieth century. The reception room was about two hundred square feet, with speckled brown and white linoleum tiles, egg-colored walls half covered with battered oak wainscoting having seen better days decades ago.

Both posters seemed to be identical to one another, which Viv found to be a strange decorating choice.

I’m reasonably sure that ninety percent of his spank bank is fantasies of driving you to work and buying you a latte on the way.” “I’m sure he doesn’t—” “What are your thoughts?” I swallow. Then I glance around the hallway, as though George’s niece’s macaroni art might hold the key to my academic future. It does not. “I . . .” I take a deep breath. “I would love to say yes.” George blinks. Then smiles. Then repeats, “Yes?” “But”—I force myself to continue past her face-splitting grin—“I can’t formally accept until I talk with my advisor. Don’t worry, though,” I add quickly, because her smile is fading fast. “I’m sure I’ll get his approval next week! I’ll explain how much I want to take the job, and he’ll agree that it’s the best choice.” George stares for a second, looking considerably less excited. “Okay.” She nods. And when I’m about to leave, she adds, “For the record, I’d love to continue being your friend. Even if you end up not accepting.” Her smile is a little strained. “Now peace out. I gotta pee, and no, you can’t listen, you weirdo.” I’m making my way back to the living room, wondering why it feels like George just resigned herself to me not taking the job, when I overhear it. “. . . slumming it with the theorists now?” It’s Andrea’s voice from the kitchen, and I stop in the hallway. I can see only about half of Jack: broad back, light hair curling on his neck, large hands storing dirty dishes in the dishwasher. I should go in and help clean up, but something tells me to skulk around like I’m corporate-espionaging in a Bond movie. “Excuse me?”\n\n\nComplete the prefix:\nhe added hastily, as Dobby's head tilted worryingly close to the wall again.

I turn it over in my hands and press the “On” button. The little LED screen flickers to life, and I press the left arrow to scroll back through the photos.

The hooded figures are standing atop it, and they have their hands raised in front of a man who is shirtless and bound at the wrists. I use the camera’s zoom feature to look closely at the shirtless man’s face. His eyes are wide, his mouth is slightly parted, and there is blood on his neck. “Who is that?” Bezi asks as she peers down at the screen. My mouth suddenly feels dry, and my hands begin to tremble. “I—I think it’s Felix.” Bezi looks at me. “Felix?” “He was supposed to run the office.” My mind runs in circles. “He missed his shift. I thought he quit.” Bezi puts her hand on my shoulder, and I press the button to look at the next picture even though I’m scared to death of what I might see. The photo’s a blur. The hooded figures are hazy, and Felix is lying on his back on the platform in the exact same spot where we’d found the bloody spot someone had tried to wash away. There’s nothing after that.

No presents, no cake, no candles, no singing. Nothing. It was just like every other year. Harry sighed and looked around the room. He was sitting in the common room with Ron and Hermione. They were all wearing their school robes, but they weren't doing anything special. They were just sitting there, looking bored. \"Well, I guess we should go to bed,\" said Hermione. \"It's getting late.\" \"Yeah,\" said Ron. \"We can get up early tomorrow and go to the library.\" \"Okay,\" said Harry.
