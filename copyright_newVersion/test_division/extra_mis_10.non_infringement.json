Santana opens an interior door, and Calaphas follows him into a vestibule. “Leave your raincoat. Don’t go drippin’ all over the place.” As they proceed along a hallway toward the lobby at the front of the building, Santana speaks a name and says, “Know who that is?” “He’s a United States senator.” Santana mentions another name. Calaphas says, “Investment fund boss. Oversees trillions.” The third name is Katherine Ormond-Wattley, the director of the ISA, to whom Calaphas answers if he answers to anyone. “Them three,” Santana says, “is so tight with Woodbine they’re Siamese twins.” “Four twins.” “You get what I’m sayin’?” “With some effort.” “Get it outta your head how Woodbine’s just some mouthpiece you can keep waitin’ while you have port. I don’t work for no pocket-change pussy. The man is on the ladder, not just on it, high up.” “Good for him. Good for you. Look, I’m sorry. It’s been a long day, that’s all.” Although of a style different from that of seventeenth-century France, the lobby rivals the Hall of Mirrors in the palace at Versailles as an effort to impress on commoners that he who resides here has pockets deeper than the sea.

When Father Christmas appeared just after midnight, I didn’t shout to him not to disturb Mother. I shouted with pleasure at something else—because he had left me a horse. This horse wasn’t like other horses I had seen, for not only was he bigger—if a horse can be said to be bigger—but he was more beautiful than any horse I had ever seen, with great long ears and wide wise eyes and a good temper, and such a gentle way of going that it was as if he floated above the ground. And this is what made me angry. Why had nobody told me about him? Why did I have to find him out for myself? I thought of all the Christmases in which I might have had him at my side if anybody had only told me. And then I thought it was lucky that I",

The most noticeable was that the Hill was no longer crowned by the great house of the Tooks, but by a tall stone tower built by Merry and Pippin. It was a very fine tower, and the people of the Shire liked to look at it and think of the brave deeds of their two heroes. They also liked to look at the great windows of the tower and wonder what was happening inside. For the Tower was the home of the King and Queen of the Shire, and they lived there all the year round. They had many guests, and often there were feasts and merry-makings, and sometimes the King would give a speech, and the Queen would sing a song.

They worked hard, but they were not troubled by ambition; they did not want more land or more gold than their fathers had had. They were not proud, and they were not envious. They lived simply, but they were not mean. They loved peace and quiet, and they hated troublemakers. They were not fond of adventures, and they did not like wizards. But they were not wholly unreasonable, and they knew that dragons were dangerous creatures, and that it was best to leave them alone if possible.

She adored the bedroom floor. It made her teeth tingle, as if her mouth were filled with sugar. It was heavenly, the home of angels. She waited at the end of the passage, smoothing her apron, listening to the clocks. Straightened her cap. The household machinery tensed, every clock hand poised, straining, ready. “Wait for Madam in the passage,” the house-parlormaid had warned her. “Don’t go and knock. She hates that.” Until now, Miss de Vries had been an entirely remote figure . Nearby, certainly: really only a few feet away if Madam was in the bedroom and Alice was in the dressing room. But she was attended by other servants. Alice observed her, studied her daily movements. She didn’t talk to her at all. The Bond Street seamstresses managed all the fittings for Madam’s ball dress. Alice despised it. It was black, per instruction, suitable for mourning. But the sleeves were fussy, heavy, and the lace looked almost antique in its design. The seamstresses worked section by section, sending parts up to Park Lane for Alice to finish. Hackwork, really, the kind of thing she could do with her eyes closed. Yet she found herself unpicking their stitches, remaking the lines, softening the gown’s edges. Trying to make it elegant. Sometimes, when she was hanging about for the latest delivery, Alice would make sketches of the gown that she’d design for Madam. Something with a little pep to it, something with a little go. Something to make people\n\n\nComplete the prefix:\nache. He missed the castle, with its secret passageways and ghosts, his lessons (though perhaps not Snape, the Potions master),",

A few years after not reciprocating my feelings, Elliot appeared to develop an almost identical friendship with another new female writer except that I had the impression they were hooking up, but it didn’t last.

He lived in a cupboard under the stairs at number four Privet Drive, Little Whinging, Surrey, with his Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon Dursley, and his fat, spoiled cousin Dudley. He didn’t have many possessions, but he did have a rather large scar on his forehead. This was because, when he was just one year old, a giant called Voldemort had tried to kill him. Harry didn’t know anything about this, of course, because he was only a baby when it happened. All he knew was that he wasn’t allowed to play with his cousin Dudley, because Dudley said he was a freak. Harry didn’t mind. He was used to being alone. He spent most of his time reading books. His favorite book was Quidditch Through the Ages",

Revolted. “I jog by her every morning,” I elaborated. “Sometimes I take her some fruit or a muffin.” Vanessa pressed her palm to her chest. “You’re so kind, Hazel.” “You are,” Laurie echoed. “But that woman could be dangerous.” “I don’t think so,” I said with a dismissive laugh. “Did she follow you here?” “Oh my god…” The fear on my face must have looked genuine because Laurie continued. “She could be scoping out homes in your neighborhood. Or she could be deranged.” “I never thought of that.” Concern fluttered across my face. They clocked it, just like I wanted them to. “You should call the police,” Laurie said. Vanessa added, “Be careful, Hazel. You can’t be friends with someone like that.” We hugged efficiently and went our separate ways. 32 I WAS DELIGHTED TO TELL Jesse how I’d played the chance encounter with Lee.

He also had a knack for getting himself into trouble, which only served to make him more determined to prove himself. As a result, Harry grew up to be a very strong and independent young man. He was also very brave, and he never gave up on his dreams. Despite all the obstacles that were thrown in his path, Harry managed to achieve great things. He became a successful businessman, and he helped many people along the way. He was also a loving husband and father, and he was always there for his family. Harry was a true inspiration to everyone who knew him, and he will always be remembered as a hero. 24 When Harry Potter first arrived at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, he was a shy and timid boy.

In fact, dragons breathed nothing more than air, and their blood was no more dangerous than that of any other living creature. However, the Muggle fear of dragons was understandable, because dragons were large, fierce creatures with sharp teeth and claws, and they were capable of causing great damage. Dragons were also very intelligent, and they were able to use magic. This made them even more dangerous than they already were. The Ministry of Magic had tried to keep the existence of dragons secret from the Muggles, but this had proved impossible. There were too many dragons in the world, and they were too well known.

A tragedy to be tossed in a tower and forgotten. “My mother told me hundreds of people came to cross the bridge shortly after the entombment, thinking they could whisper their wants and secrets to the sleeping Awaleen. The bridge is so long, it took weeks before anyone realized none of them finished the crossing.” Their bodies simply vanished, devoured by the mist shrouding Sirauk. Fairel shuddered. “How terrible. Then why do we celebrate the Awaleen with the Alcalah?” Because it is the nature of humanity to celebrate the things that want to kill them. We resumed our walk. I guided us off the main road, onto the street hosting Daron’s tavern and the visitors’ tents. I would never bring Fairel down this road under normal circumstances, but the Nizahl patrol would be eager to prove themselves to their Commander, and there was no glory in harassing drunkards leaving the tavern. “The tournament is a remembrance. We thank the Awaleen for their sacrifice and honor them by sending our most worthy Champions to compete in the Alcalah.” Fairel slapped a mosquito from her ear. She peered up at me. “Do you think I might become Champion someday?” I skidded to a halt, gaping at her. “Most of the Champions die, Fairel.” “They die brave.

She bought an iced coffee and Doritos, and set up about a half block away from the apartment. She wanted to see her mother, make sure she was okay. She had thought about just knocking on the door, but Mira would panic if she showed up unannounced. And how would Alex explain where she’d gotten the money to fly home? She still felt a pang when she saw her mother’s friend Andrea at the intercom. A minute later, Mira emerged in yoga pants and an oversized Tshirt emblazoned with an ornate hamsa, reusable shopping bags slung over her shoulder. They strode off together, arms and legs pumping in a power walk, and Alex followed for a while. She knew they were headed to the farmers’ market, where they’d buy bone broth or spirulina or organic alfalfa. Her mother looked happy and golden, her blond hair freshly highlighted, her soft arms tanned. She looked like a stranger. The Mira Alex knew lived in a constant state of worry for her angry, crazy daughter. This woman’s daughter went to Yale. She had a summer job. She texted photos of her roommates and new spring flowers and noodle bowls. Alex sat down on a bench at the edge of the park, and watched her mother and Andrea disappear into the white tents of the market. She felt breathless and teary and like she wanted to hit something. Mira had been a crap mother, too caught up in her own storms to be any kind of an anchor. For a while Alex had hated her, and some part of her still did.

He was always cheerful and polite, and he never lost his temper, even when they were cruel to him. He was also very clever, and he soon learned to do all sorts of things that made the Dursleys look foolish. He could clean up after himself, and he could cook simple meals. He could mend his clothes and polish his shoes. He could even perform small acts of magic, such as making the fire burn brighter or lighting candles without matches. The Dursleys were furious when they discovered that Harry was doing these things, but they couldn’t punish him because he was so good at keeping secrets. They tried to keep him busy all the time, so that he wouldn’t have time to think about magic, but this only made him more determined to learn. He read",

In the 1970s, Brazil won three World Cups in a row, but since then the country has failed to reach the final even once. The national team has not won a major tournament since 2007. The decline has been particularly pronounced in recent years. In 2014, Brazil hosted the World Cup, but the team was eliminated in the quarterfinals by Germany. Four years later, the team lost to Belgium in the quarterfinals of the Copa América. In 2019, Brazil finished seventh at the Copa América, its worst performance ever.

        "output": " hard to qualify for the tournament? The answer is simple: Brazil has never had a professional league. In fact, the country’s top clubs are owned by banks, insurance companies and other corporations, which means that players are not paid according to their performance. Instead, they are paid according to their contracts, which are negotiated by agents. This system has led to a situation where the best players in the world are playing for the worst teams in the world. For example, Neymar, one of the most talented players in the world, plays for Santos, a team that finished 14th in the Brazilian league last season. Meanwhile, Barcelona, one of the richest clubs in the world, has struggled to find a replacement for Lionel Messi, who left the club last summer. The reason for this is simple: Barcelona cannot afford to pay Neymar what he is worth. As a result, the club has been forced to rely on young players like",

Mira had been a crap mother, too caught up in her own storms to be any kind of an anchor. For a while Alex had hated her, and some part of her still did. She hadn’t been born with her mother’s gift for forgiving or forgetting. She didn’t have Mira’s sunshine hair and soft blue eyes, her love for peace, her bookshelves lined with ways to be kinder, more empathetic, a gentler being in the world, a force for good.

As an experienced player, he often notices things that seem mundane but that eventually prove to be essential to a winning strategy.

Against the back wall of that space is a pegboard on which only a few electronic keys hang. As an experienced player, he often notices things that seem mundane but that eventually prove to be essential to a winning strategy. Santana opens an interior door, and Calaphas follows him into a vestibule. “Leave your raincoat. Don’t go drippin’ all over the place.” As they proceed along a hallway toward the lobby at the front of the building, Santana speaks a name and says, “Know who that is?” “He’s a United States senator.” Santana mentions another name. Calaphas says, “Investment fund boss. Oversees trillions.” The third name is Katherine Ormond-Wattley, the director of the ISA, to whom Calaphas answers if he answers to anyone. “Them three,” Santana says, “is so tight with Woodbine they’re Siamese twins.” “Four twins.” “You get what I’m sayin’?” “With some effort.” “Get it outta your head how Woodbine’s just some mouthpiece you can keep waitin’ while you have port. I don’t work for no pocket-change pussy. The man is on the ladder, not just on it, high up.” “Good for him. Good for you. Look, I’m sorry. It’s been a long day, that’s all.” Although of a style different from that of seventeenth-century France, the lobby rivals the Hall of Mirrors in the palace at Versailles as an effort to impress on commoners that he who resides here has pockets deeper than the sea.

And while she waited, she roamed Dacre’s underground fortress, those old ley lines of magic, memorizing its twists and bends and its many secret doorways to above. Three days and three nights later, Dacre finally awoke, closely followed by his brothers, and then the remainder of his court. His mind was foggy; his hands felt numb. He lumbered to his feet, uncertain what had happened, but the fires in the hall had burned down, and it was dark. “Enva?” he called to her.

Not a week passed before he was hungry for her music again, and he called another assembly in the hall, so she could entertain them. She played for sorrow. For joy. And then for sleep. This time, she sang her lullaby twice as long, and Dacre and his court slept for six days and six nights. By the time Dacre stirred awake, cold and stiff, when he called to Enva through the stone there was no answer. He reached to feel her presence, which was like a thread of sunlight in his fortress, but there was only darkness. Enraged, he realized she had gone above. He rallied his creatures and his servants to fight, but when they emerged through the secret doorways into the world above, Enva and a Skyward host\n\n\nComplete the prefix:\nodd things happen without meaning to, believing the Dursleys' story that he had got his scar in the car crash"

Soon her music was woven with the sound of hundreds of snores, and she stood alone in the hall, the only one still awake. She wondered how long they would sleep. How long would her music hold them ensorcelled? She left the hall and decided to wait and see. And while she waited, she roamed Dacre’s underground fortress, those old ley lines of magic, memorizing its twists and bends and its many secret doorways to above. Three days and three nights later, Dacre finally awoke, closely followed by his brothers, and then the remainder of his court. His mind was foggy; his hands felt numb. He lumbered to his feet, uncertain what had happened, but the fires in the hall had burned down, and it was dark. “Enva?” he called to her. His voice carried through the rock to find her. “Enva!” He feared she had gone, but she emerged into the hall, carrying a torch. “What happened?” he demanded, but Enva was poised and calm. “I’m not certain,” she replied with a yawn. “I only just woke, a minute before you.” Dacre was disconcerted, but in that moment, he thought Enva beautiful, and he trusted her. Not a week passed before he was hungry for her music again, and he called another assembly in the hall, so she could entertain them. She played for sorrow. For joy. And then for sleep. This time, she sang her lullaby twice as long, and Dacre and his court slept for six days and six nights. By the time Dacre stirred awake, cold and stiff, when he called to Enva through the stone there was no answer. He reached to feel her presence, which was like a thread of sunlight in his fortress, but there was only darkness. Enraged, he realized she had gone above. He rallied his creatures and his servants to fight, but when they emerged through the secret doorways into the world above, Enva and a Skyward host\n\n\nComplete the prefix:\nodd things happen without meaning to, believing the Dursleys' story that he had got his scar in the car crash",

They were too independent, too aloof. He had always preferred dogs. But there was something about this cat that was different. It seemed to like him. It purred loudly whenever he stroked its fur. Harry wondered if it would like to go outside. He picked it up and carried it into the garden. The cat immediately began to explore. It sniffed the flowers, rubbed against the fence, and even tried to catch a butterfly. Harry watched it for a while, then went back inside. He was just about to sit down when he heard a loud meow.

When he woke up, he found himself lying on the floor, with his head resting on the cat’s stomach. It was a very strange feeling, being so close to a cat. Harry had never really liked cats much. They were too independent, too aloof. He had always preferred dogs. But there was something about this cat that was different. It seemed to like him. It purred loudly whenever he stroked its fur. Harry wondered if it would like to go outside. He picked it up and carried it into the garden. The cat immediately began to explore.

They were becoming careless and forgetful, and they no longer told stories of the past. They were beginning to neglect their gardens and their fields, and to spend too much time in the taverns and in idle talk. And they were beginning to forget the old songs and tales, and to lose interest in the lore of their people. So it was that Frodo Baggins, who was descended from the great Bilbo, and who had inherited his love of adventure and his gift for languages, decided to leave the Shire and go out into the wide world. He knew that he would never be able to return to the Shire as it once was, but he hoped that by traveling and learning about other cultures, he might be able to help his people remember their own history and traditions.

But I neither longed for nor resented him, as I’d always sensed he believed. Though I’d been hurt and humiliated by his rejection, it had, I soon realized, freed me and offered clarity. I would never again risk poisoning TNO for myself by falling for or trying to date anyone there. And this decision made me see that there was a different way I wrote when, even subconsciously, I was seeking male approval, male sexual approval: a more coy way, more reserved, more nervous about being perceived as angry or vulgar. It was the syntactical equivalent of dressing up as a sexy zombie for Halloween. From my third season on, I’d embraced my anger and vulgarity. I’d been a gross zombie. I began writing about ostensibly female topics—camel toe and wage inequity, polycystic ovary syndrome and Jane Austen, Do-si-dos and Trefoils and mammograms and shapewear and Dirty Dancing and the so-called likeability of female politicians. By October of that year, I’d written my first viral sketch, Nancy Drew and the Disappearing Access to Abortion, in which Henrietta played the amateur detective.

And this decision made me see that there was a different way I wrote when, even subconsciously, I was seeking male approval, male sexual approval: a more coy way, more reserved, more nervous about being perceived as angry or vulgar.

For a moment, she couldn’t concentrate on anything but their fingers pressed together, but then he said, “And where are we going?” She shook off the strange feeling in her stomach and grinned at the man who looked far too nervous for someone who held so much power. All she held was his hand. “Somewhere without papers to scowl at. Come.” Only when they were outside did she realize how intimate the gesture of holding his hand really was. Locked together as they were, her skirts brushed his boots and she could smell the soap he used. Hardly appropriate , even if she had been his sister-in-law or close to it. She attempted to release him—he could hardly want that prolonged contact—but he held fast to her fingers and watched her with an intense look as they walked, as if he were desperate for whatever reprieve she could give him.

I would never bring Fairel down this road under normal circumstances, but the Nizahl patrol would be eager to prove themselves to their Commander, and there was no glory in harassing drunkards leaving the tavern. “The tournament is a remembrance. We thank the Awaleen for their sacrifice and honor them by sending our most worthy Champions to compete in the Alcalah.” Fairel slapped a mosquito from her ear. She peered up at me. “Do you think I might become Champion someday?” I skidded to a halt, gaping at her. “Most of the Champions die, Fairel.” “They die brave. It is a worthy sacrifice,” she said. “Just like the Awaleen.” I thought of the watch guard frog in my bucket and knelt to Fairel’s eye level\n\n\nComplete the prefix:\nbeen phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain I promised yesterday, they've had a downpour of shooting",

Viv watched as Meg and Wyatt settled into two straight-back molded plastic seats. It was as if time had stood still here in this small town. The so-called hospital was more like a health clinic straight out of the twentieth century. The reception room was about two hundred square feet, with speckled brown and white linoleum tiles, egg-colored walls half covered with battered oak wainscoting having seen better days decades ago. There was a large bay window in serious need of a good scrubbing, but it at least allowed the morning sun in to brighten the all but otherwise unremarkable room. The adjacent wall donned two faded framed posters, matching alpine scenes, a group of colorfully clad skiers traversing steep, powdered slopes. Both posters seemed to be identical to one another, which Viv found to be a strange decorating choice. The glass overhead dome light put out little illumination, probably because of the inside layer of long-deceased insect parts. In one corner of the room was a water cooler surrounded by flowered Dixie cups. A low Crayola-strewn table held several dogeared coloring books, several Tonka toy trucks, and a lone stuffed rabbit, sans one ear. Staring at nothing in particular, she blinked, then blinked again. This wasn’t the first time she’d caught herself. She briefly wondered if it was possible to actually die of boredom. Was there a medical term for that?

All Harry's spellbooks, his wand, robes, cauldron and top-of-the-range Nimbus Two Thousand broomstick had been locked in a cupboard under the stairs by",

I turn it over in my hands and press the “On” button. The little LED screen flickers to life, and I press the left arrow to scroll back through the photos. There are pictures of Bezi and Paige in the car. They’re making faces and smiling wide. A knot crawls up my throat.

The hooded figures are standing atop it, and they have their hands raised in front of a man who is shirtless and bound at the wrists. I use the camera’s zoom feature to look closely at the shirtless man’s face. His eyes are wide, his mouth is slightly parted, and there is blood on his neck. “Who is that?” Bezi asks as she peers down at the screen. My mouth suddenly feels dry, and my hands begin to tremble. “I—I think it’s Felix.” Bezi looks at me. “Felix?” “He was supposed to run the office.” My mind runs in circles. “He missed his shift.

The hooded figures are hazy, and Felix is lying on his back on the platform in the exact same spot where we’d found the bloody spot someone had tried to wash away. There’s nothing after that.
