And he had a magic ring which made him invisible, and a sword that gave light, and a wand that shot stars. His house at Bag End was bursting with treasures, till the front doors had to be taken off their hinges to give him room to get out and go on more journeys.

His friends made enquiries about him, saying that he was needed in the village; but no news could be got. Many people had seen goblins riding west of the river on the road to Rohan on that very night; but no one had actually caught a glimpse of Bilbo Baggins.

It also served as a nickname for Thorin Oakenshield, the most stalwart and industrious of the thirteen dwarves accompanying Bilbo on his unexpected journey. Thorin was a great lover of gold and silver, and he had been known to spend hours poring over maps of the Lonely Mountain, trying to find the best way to reach its treasure trove.

Wizards kept themselves very well hidden from the No-Maj world and it was generally agreed among them that it should stay that way. For centuries wizards had lived quite happily alongside No-Majs, keeping themselves secret and unaffected by the non-magical world until something went wrong. It happened every few hundred years when some wizard let details of the magical community slip out into the Muggle world. This time it was the fault of the goblins. They had always been difficult to deal with, but now they were becoming downright dangerous. Goblins were short, ugly little creatures who lived mainly underground and did most of the world’s goldsmithing.

But what if things had gone differently? What if Harry hadn’t been able to defeat Voldemort? What if he’d never become a hero? In this new story by J.K. Rowling, an adult Harry finds himself on a different course. He wants a nice, normal life after defeating You-Know-Who, and he thinks he’s found it with the Muggles he’s married. But then he receives a package in the mail that changes everything. Inside is a book written by a young man named Newt Scamander, who claims to be a wizard. Harry reads the book and discovers that magic really does exist—and that he might not be the only person who knows about it. This is a story about how",

She had thought about just knocking on the door, but Mira would panic if she showed up unannounced. And how would Alex explain where she’d gotten the money to fly home? She still felt a pang when she saw her mother’s friend Andrea at the intercom. A minute later, Mira emerged in yoga pants and an oversized Tshirt emblazoned with an ornate hamsa, reusable shopping bags slung over her shoulder. They strode off together, arms and legs pumping in a power walk, and Alex followed for a while. She knew they were headed to the farmers’ market, where they’d buy bone broth or spirulina or organic alfalfa. Her mother looked happy and golden, her blond hair freshly highlighted, her soft arms tanned. She looked like a stranger. The Mira Alex knew lived in a constant state of worry for her angry, crazy daughter. This woman’s daughter went to Yale. She had a summer job. She texted photos of her roommates and new spring flowers and noodle bowls. Alex sat down on a bench at the edge of the park, and watched her mother and Andrea disappear into the white tents of the market. She felt breathless and teary and like she wanted to hit something. Mira had been a crap mother, too caught up in her own storms to be any kind of an anchor. For a while Alex had hated her, and some part of her still did. She hadn’t been born with her mother’s gift for forgiving or forgetting. She didn’t have Mira’s sunshine hair and soft blue eyes, her love for peace, her bookshelves lined with ways to be kinder, more empathetic, a gentler being in the world, a force for good.

He missed the Weasleys’ house, with its warm kitchen and cozy living room, and he missed the Burrow’s garden, which was always full of flowers and buzzing insects. He even missed Hogwarts’ leaky old roofs and the fact that the corridors stank of damp socks. He missed everything about the wizarding world except for one thing: Voldemort.

So he set off, running at random through the dark streets, not looking where he was going, hands outstretched in the hope that they would grasp a clue. He ran till he was gasping for breath, ran across a road blind to cars, ran headlong into a lamp post, bounced off it and fell. He sat up, shaking his head clear, wondering where he was and what he had done. Then he saw the sign, gleaming dimly in the streetlight: THE LEAKY CAULDRON. He stared at it, thinking hard.

Everyone loved Grif.

        "output": " good laugh at the expense of the Muggle who had fallen for the trick. This was a common prank among young wizards and witches, but it was also used as a means of intimidation by some Dark wizards and witches. For example, during the 1990s, a group of Death Eaters led by Lucius Malfoy used this technique to frighten Muggles into giving them money. In addition, the Ministry of Magic has been known to use this tactic against those who are suspected of being involved in criminal activity. However, despite its widespread use, there is no evidence that the Flame-Freezing Charm actually causes physical harm to anyone who falls victim to it. Instead, it appears to be nothing more than an elaborate hoax designed to make people believe they are experiencing something supernatural. As such, it should not be taken seriously by anyone who knows better.\n\nComplete the prefix:\nThe first time I saw my father's face, I was five years old. My mother had brought me to visit",

Meanwhile, Marion would be moping around her childhood bedroom, fretting over being fired and wondering what might have been. There was no way for her to travel back in time and audition for the School of American Ballet, but perhaps that didn’t mean all was lost. What if, for one day, she pursued a path that she’d thought was closed—followed in her mother’s footsteps and took a chance? Instead of tamping down her passion for dance, as her father and Nathaniel wanted, what if she struck out on her own and joined the hundreds of dancers hoping to become a Rockette at Radio City Music Hall? If she failed and was laughed out of the room, she’d at least know that dancing professionally had never been an option after all. There was only one way to find out. CHAPTER FOUR Marion rose with the sun and slipped a cotton day dress over a fresh pair of tights and a leotard. She put her hair up into a tight bun and brushed her teeth as quietly as she could in the bathroom. Her bag was by the door where she’d left it, holding her pointe shoes, a pair of tap shoes, and her well-worn character shoes. She had to be prepared for anything. She was still angry at her dad for taking away the pearls like she was a child. Last night, after she’d stormed upstairs, she heard him go to his study and open the safe, where he would keep the necklace until her punishment was over. It was stupid, really.

Meanwhile, Marion would be moping around her childhood bedroom, fretting over being fired and wondering what might have been. There was no way for her to travel back in time and audition for the School of American Ballet, but perhaps that didn’t mean all was lost. What if, for one day, she pursued a path that she’d thought was closed—followed in her mother’s footsteps and took a chance? Instead of tamping down her passion for dance, as her father and Nathaniel wanted, what if she struck out on her own and joined the hundreds of dancers hoping to become a Rockette at Radio City Music Hall? If she failed and was laughed out of the room, she’d at least know that dancing professionally had never been an option after all. There was only one way to find out. CHAPTER FOUR Marion rose with the sun and slipped a cotton day dress over a fresh pair of tights and a leotard. She put her hair up into a tight bun and brushed her teeth as quietly as she could in the bathroom. Her bag was by the door where she’d left it, holding her pointe shoes, a pair of tap shoes, and her well-worn character shoes. She had to be prepared for anything. She was still angry at her dad for taking away the pearls like she was a child. Last night, after she’d stormed upstairs, she heard him go to his study and open the safe, where he would keep the necklace until her punishment was over. It was stupid, really.

He hated his job, which involved sitting in a tiny office all day long, writing reports and filling out forms. He hated his boss, who was always yelling at him for something or other. And he hated his colleagues, who were all idiots. They spent their days gossiping about each other and making fun of people who weren’t there. The worst thing about his job was that he couldn't tell anyone about it. Not even his family. His parents would think he'd gone mad if they found out what he did for a living. But he couldn't just quit, because then he wouldn't have any money to live on. So he was stuck in this dead-end job, hating every minute of it. He sighed heavily and rolled over onto his side.

However, there were some who took it too far and ended up hurting themselves instead of their victims. One such incident occurred when a group of young witches and wizards decided to play a prank on an unsuspecting Muggle family. They performed the Flame-Freezing Charm on the father’s hand, causing him to scream in agony as if he had been burned by fire. The mother rushed over to help her husband, but before she could do anything, the children began laughing hysterically. The father, still in pain, turned around and saw his wife and children laughing at him. He became furious and started yelling at them, demanding to know why they were laughing at him. The children continued to laugh, saying that they were just playing a joke on him. The father lost control and grabbed one of the children by the arm, pulling him close",

However, there were some who took it too far and ended up hurting themselves instead of their victims. One such incident occurred when a group of young witches and wizards decided to play a prank on an unsuspecting Muggle family. They performed the Flame-Freezing Charm on the father’s hand, causing him to scream in agony as if he had been burned by fire. The mother rushed over to help her husband, but before she could do anything, the children began laughing hysterically. The father, still in pain, turned around and saw his wife and children laughing at him. He became furious and started yelling at them, demanding to know why they were laughing at him. The children continued to laugh, saying that they were just playing a joke on him. The father lost control and grabbed one of the children by the arm, pulling him close",

She barricaded herself in the guest room that night, placing her oversized luggage against the door. Family members like her were also on the receiving end of virtual harassment from dark corners of the web. Nonetheless, they told me not to let the MAGA antagonists win. Voters needed to hear the truth before it was too late. So I went for broke. I agreed to as many interviews as possible to talk about who Trump really was, detailing as much as I could to anyone who would listen. The growing media exposure led to a stream of angry messages from MAGA strangers. As a precaution, I went to the shooting range to practice with my concealed\n\n\nComplete the prefix:\nThe witch or wizard would perform a basic Flame-Freezing Charm and then pretend to shriek with pain while enjoying a",

The Ministry had decreed that all wizards and witches must carry a wand at all times. And if you were caught without your wand, you’d be fined five Galleons. Five Galleons! That was more than some families earned in a year. I couldn’t believe it. I mean, I knew the Ministry was getting stricter and stricter, but this was ridiculous. I was just trying to enjoy a quiet cup of tea. What was wrong with that? I decided to take matters into my own hands. I went down to Diagon Alley and bought myself a fake wand. It looked exactly like an ordinary wand, except it was made of rubber. I put it in my pocket and headed home. When I got there, I pulled out my fake wand and waved it around. Nothing happened. I tried again. Still nothing.",

In fact, this was how the term \"lightning bolt\" came into use as a metaphor for a bad grade on a school test. The charm was also used to scare away intruders, though it was rarely effective because most people would simply assume that the house was haunted. The spell was also used to create a diversion during a robbery, allowing the thief to escape unnoticed. However, the spell was not foolproof, as some victims would become suspicious and investigate further. In one case, a man named George Weasley was able to deduce that he had been the target of a prank and confronted the perpetrator, who turned out to be his own father, Arthur Weasley.

But Wilhelm Ewers had been neglected after his brother’s death. He’d grown up alone in a distant, large house, with no playmates to joke with him. My parents heaped praise upon my older brother and left me to spend lonely afternoons in my room, anticipating my early demise, he’d written. An angry little kid who had been informed he was special and the rest of the world was beneath him.

The palm trees lining the avenue that led them into Las Lomas were glowing bright with Christmas lights, but otherwise the festivities were subdued in this part of the city. Neatly trimmed hedges hid expensive houses, and sober driveways sneaked behind tall walls. People in Las Lomas had real gardens, with purple bougainvilleas and pale roses, unlike everyone in Montserrat’s sphere, who made do with potted plants. This area was “exclusive,” which also meant people had good security. Even if Clarimonde Bauer was still living at the address on the invitation, they could be chased away by bodyguards. They could also end up in jail, if the lady got nasty, and Montserrat did not want to have conversations with cops again. But there was nothing left to do but roll the dice. They turned left, taking a side street. It was practically impossible to see the numbers on some of these houses or the names of the streets. Nobody cared to put up the proper signage, because if you lived there, you knew where you were headed. “I think it’s that one,” Tristán said. Montserrat stopped the car and stared at the house Tristán had pointed out. A white wall surrounded it, and there was a silver metal gate.

But Wilhelm Ewers had been neglected after his brother’s death. He’d grown up alone in a distant, large house, with no playmates to joke with him. My parents heaped praise upon my older brother and left me to spend lonely afternoons in my room, anticipating my early demise, he’d written. An angry little kid who had been informed he was special and the rest of the world was beneath him. She slid her headphones off her ears, letting them rest on the back of her neck. * * * — She picked up Tristán the following evening around seven. The palm trees lining the avenue that led them into Las Lomas were glowing bright with Christmas lights, but otherwise the festivities were subdued in this part of the city. Neatly trimmed hedges hid expensive houses, and sober driveways sneaked behind tall walls. People in Las Lomas had real gardens, with purple bougainvilleas and pale roses, unlike everyone in Montserrat’s sphere, who made do with potted plants. This area was “exclusive,” which also meant people had good security. Even if Clarimonde Bauer was still living at the address on the invitation, they could be chased away by bodyguards. They could also end up in jail, if the lady got nasty, and Montserrat did not want to have conversations with cops again. But there was nothing left to do but roll the dice. They turned left, taking a side street. It was practically impossible to see the numbers on some of these houses or the names of the streets. Nobody cared to put up the proper signage, because if you lived there, you knew where you were headed. “I think it’s that one,” Tristán said. Montserrat stopped the car and stared at the house Tristán had pointed out. A white wall surrounded it, and there was a silver metal gate. Behind it you could glimpse a house with a coarse gray exterior.\n\n\nComplete the prefix:\nHogwarts had given him a lot of holiday work.

He’d never heard of Shrinking Potions before, let alone tried to brew one. He’d had to ask Hermione for help, and even then, he hadn’t understood half of what she’d told him. He’d fallen asleep over his essay, and when he woke up, he found himself lying on top of it. He’d spent the next day cleaning up the mess he’d made, and now he was exhausted. He didn’t know how he was going to get through the rest of the holidays. He needed to find a way to relax, but he couldn’t seem to stop thinking about school.

The next step was to use a simple Disarming Charm to remove the wand from the victim’s hands. Then, the witch or wizard would simply say, “I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to do that,” and walk away. If the victim tried to follow them, the witch or wizard would simply cast a Confundus Charm on them, making them forget where they were going. Finally, the witch or wizard would cast a Memory Charm on the victim, erasing all memory of the incident. This would leave the victim feeling confused and disoriented, but unable to remember exactly what happened. With these three spells, a witch or wizard can easily escape from a situation without anyone knowing what really happened.

Lionel Messi scored the winning goal in the 93rd minute, giving Argentina its first World Cup title since 1986. \"It's an incredible feeling,\" Messi said. \"We've been working hard for this moment for many years.

A phone rings, and Joe reaches to pull it out of his pocket. “Would you two excuse me? I have to take this. It’s Blake,” he says with a knowing roll of his eyes, and I mouth, Lively? to Finn, whose mouth only twitches in response. Once Joe leaves, all the questions and confusion about Finn rise to the surface. My grip tightens on my spoon. Because I’m not just confused—I’m angry. Angry he lied to me, angry I’m sitting here like a fucking idiot with my delicious pumpkin soup while his manager taunts me with an amazing job I absolutely cannot take. My mind was made up as soon as I saw him sitting here. “You gave me a fake name.” Somehow, this is the first thing that comes out.

She had to pretend she didnâ€™t care. And so she did. She smiled and laughed and joked around with everyone else, even though she felt like she was dying inside. She tried to act normal, but it was hard. Every time someone mentioned the word â€œfire,â€ she wanted to scream. Every time someone said anything about the fire, she wanted to run away. But she didnâ€™t. She stayed there, pretending everything was fine. Pretending she wasnâ€™t scared. Pretending she wasnâ€™t hurt. Pretending she wasnâ€™t broken.

He knew that she would have wanted him to move on, to start living again. But how? He didn't know where to begin.

Not a picture or a carpet or even a curtain. The only thing that wasn’t ugly was a big old trunk in the corner, which was covered in dust. Harry opened it cautiously. Inside were a lot of small boxes and something wrapped in a very old blanket. Harry lifted the blanket carefully off whatever was underneath it. It was a wand, its tip carved with an unusual reptilian figure. Harry picked it up and held it in front of his face. It looked exactly like his father’s, but it was slightly smaller and more supple than the real one. Harry smiled. This must have been his father’s wand when",

The scar was a kind of badge that showed the whole world he was special, just like Dumbledore had always told him. \"You are the boy who lived: whoever heard of such a remarkable thing? You are destined for great things, Harry.\" Dumbledore had always been very interested in Harry's scar, which he called a \"curious\" feature. Harry had no idea what he meant, except that the scar sometimes twinged if Voldemort was close by - or if he himself was feeling strong emotions. Harry had been thinking about the scar quite often lately. Why did it tingle in the presence of Snape, whom he loathed and feared? Why did it burn against the touch of Quirrell",

Don’t let anybody be at your back, my instincts said. In these woods, I wasn’t going to even try to talk my hindbrain out of it. “I don’t want you to think that I’ve forgotten. Like I don’t think about it anymore. About you,” she said. “I’ve done so much therapy, you wouldn’t even believe it.” I grunted in amusement. “In a competition of who’s had more time getting psychoanalyzed, I do not think you would win, Cassidy Green.” “I’m not saying it’s a competition.” “Then you have changed,” I replied, flashing her a smile to take the edge off it, and she sighed. “I was a little shit back then,” she said. “So was I. That’s why we got along,” I reminded her. I paused. “And it’s not like I can blame you.” “What do you mean?” she asked. I paused. “I know it wasn’t easy for you at home. Your parents…” “I’m not about to whine about my rich parents to you,” she said. “Even I’m not that clueless.” “At least my dad never hit me,” I said quietly. I’d seen her bruises. Always where they wouldn’t be noticed. She looked away. “Granted, he was neglectful as fuck and it’s a miracle I didn’t get carted off by raccoons to raise as their own.” She laughed at that, but quickly fell silent. “It wasn’t that bad.

        "output": " you’re wondering why Harry Potter is so popular, well, there are many reasons. But one reason is that J.K. Rowling created a world where magic is real, and where wizards and witches live among us. In this world, there are many different types of magical creatures, including unicorns, dragons, and mermaids. There are also many different kinds of spells, potions, and charms. And there are many different ways to use magic, such as through wands, brooms, and cauldrons. But perhaps the most important aspect of Harry Potter is its message of hope and friendship. Through the adventures of Harry, Ron, Hermione, and their friends, readers learn that even in the darkest times, there is always hope. They also learn that true friendship is worth fighting for, no matter what obstacles stand in your way. So if you’re looking for a story that will transport you to a world of wonder and adventure, look no further than Harry Potter. You won’t regret",

He had shouted at the fireplace, demanding to know why he couldn't stay where he belonged, with people who loved him, rather than being exiled once more to the house of his unworthy relatives. But now he realised that Dumbledore had known what he was doing. His hand strayed to his neck, and he touched the chain around it, feeling the small golden locket hanging from it. He had found it in Hagrid's hut, hidden inside a book. It was a gift from Dumbledore to give to Sirius Black, but Sirius had died before they could meet.

It was hard to explain, because he didn’t really understand it himself. He’d never seen a Shrinking Potion before, but he knew that if he drank some, he would shrink. He’d also heard that if you put too much into your mouth, you could choke. So he’d written about the dangers of choking, which seemed like a good idea at the time. But when he read over the essay later, he realised that it sounded like he was saying that Shrinking Potions were dangerous. Which wasn’t true at all! They were perfectly safe, as long as you used them properly. He decided to rewrite the whole thing, but by then it was too late. Professor McGonagall had already marked it. She’d given him a very low mark, and told him that he needed to do better next time.",

'Not at all,' said the Queen. 'Sit down, fourteen.' Alice looked all round the table, but there was such a jumble of little couches, and chairs, and tables, and little curtains, and tartan mats, and Japanese models, and fiddle-de-dee, that she couldn't make out at all which chair to go to.

He’d also heard that if you put too much into your mouth, you could choke. So he’d written about the dangers of choking, which seemed like a good idea at the time.

Helen would have charmed him with her beauty and subtle cleverness, softening him until he opened like a peach. Castor would have mocked him, pricked him with words like needles until he talked. Timandra and Polydeuces wouldn’t have tried. “He is dangerous,” they would have said. “Better get rid of him.” And they would have been right. He is dangerous, but she can’t get rid of him, so she has to find a way to crack him.

He wanted to be normal, and if being normal meant being bullied by Draco Malfoy and his friends, then so be it. It wasn't until the end of his first year at Hogwarts that Harry realized just how much he'd been missing out on. That's when he met Hermione Granger, a Muggle-born witch who was determined to help him understand his magical heritage. Together, they set out to uncover the truth about Voldemort's rise to power and defeat him once and for all. Along the way, they made some unlikely allies, including Ron Weasley, a Gryffindor boy who was always ready to lend a hand. With their combined strength, they were able to overcome even the most daunting obstacles and emerge victorious.

He started to develop abilities that even the most experienced wizards had never seen before. His powers were so great that he was eventually able to escape from Hogwarts and start his own school for young witches and wizards. There, he taught them how to use their magic in ways that were both creative and destructive.

He remembers Andy’s hand on the small of Emily’s back as they walked out of the restaurant. That’s what he wants, and he doesn’t even know what to call it. He changes out of his suit and puts on a pair of jeans and a leather jacket, then heads out, up to Greenwich Avenue, where at least he can find someone to take the edge off. * * * July 1958 Nick is pretty sure that if he hadn’t first known his nephew—a fourteen-year-old who goes through life with untied shoes and perpetually skinned knees, surrounded by a chaotic cloud of comic books and pencils and baseball cards—he wouldn’t know what to think about Andy. In May, Andy gets stuck in the elevator at the criminal courts building for three hours, then turns up at the Chronicle looking mildly traumatized but bearing a box of doughnuts to apologize for cutting it so close to the filing deadline.

When the winds are against us, men on towpaths pull the boat upstream with ropes. In shallow waters, the boatmen use poles to propel us. If the water is deep, they rely on oars. We pass through locks that raise or lower the vessel to the required levels. We go day and night, covering about ninety li between sunrises. The greatest surprise is that the person who steers the boat is a woman. Her face is brown from the sun, her body wiry. She is, without doubt, lowly to have a position in which she works with her hands. As such, she sleeps under a lean-to on the deck. Fall is upon us—the weather temperate, and the skies clear—which allows Miss Zhao and me to spend a lot of time on the deck taking in the scenery. Here in the south, we see abundance in every direction. Villages are well populated, with houses and other buildings made of brick, with tile roofs. Fields spread wide and lush with autumnal crops.

Sam stares up at him for too long without saying anything, which is exactly what I do: become fully paralyzed while in the proximity of a handsome person. But the hot dude isn’t important, he’s basically in here as an avatar for every single one of my high school classmates who I’d run into while they were home from college to passively remind me of my ongoing failure to fully realize my potential. Sam asks Brandon what he’s doing on this sad, regular-person street, and he goes into a whole thing about college, but here’s the main point of this Brandon character: to introduce the idea that Sam is a “writer” into the show. I really wrestled with the idea of my writing being a part of this show, and if it were up to just me, I don’t know that it would be. I mean, practically speaking, writing is boring. On the one hand, the only writing I was doing when I worked at the bakery was at night, after we closed, on the little computer in the upstairs office while the overnight crew was down in the kitchen making Danish and bread for the morning rush. I didn’t write anything of consequence, just elaborate romantic fantasies written as short stories featuring thinly veiled versions of myself. On the other, if you tune into a show about me (in hindsight, an absolute nightmare possibility!), you’re probably doing so because you’ve read something I’ve written, and it would be super weird if the writing went unacknowledged on the show. We reached a kind of compromise that is hard to explain, please bear with\n\n\nComplete the prefix:\nhe dared tell her he'd heard the name 'Potter'. He decided he didn't dare.

The sun had set behind the hills, and the sky was turning red. He could see the lights of the village twinkling in the distance. He thought about going back, but he knew he couldn't. He turned around and started walking again. He walked for hours, until he came to a small town. He found a hotel and checked in. He sat in his room, looking out the window at the darkening sky. He thought about what had happened that day. He thought about how he had met the girl, and how he had told her his name. He thought about how he had lied to her, and how he had left her alone in the forest.",

She had straight black hair, bright brown eyes, a wide smile and very white teeth - she looked a bit like a red-haired Hagrid, except she was a woman. Her customers loved her. She had a sort of glamorous quality that attracted them, and an atmosphere of fun and goodwill around her that made them keep coming back to drink in her bar.

And though my father felt so far from me after he died, he no longer feels so distant, lost beyond my reach—it’s as if she has given a part of him back to me now that they are wherever they are, together, my ancestors by love and choice if not by blood. * * * In October, on what would have been my mother’s sixty-ninth birthday, I write her a letter and buy a nice meal to eat at home with my family—nothing fancy, nothing my mom had ever made for me, just something I know she would have enjoyed. (She always, until her final days, ate quickly and with much gusto, a trait I’m sure I got from her.) I can’t visit her grave, with the headstone I chose to match my dad’s, but I send flowers to the cemetery. I order them from the same florist who designed my mother’s memorial flowers, and she promises to use the same colors. The two arrangements are made in different seasons, with different flowers in bloom, so of course they cannot be exactly the same. Nor can a livestreamed funeral provide the same experience, the same companionship or comfort, as one you’re able to attend in person. But neither this life-changing loss nor the depth of gratitude I feel because I had her as a parent can be undermined by the unforeseen, by disease, or by distance. She was my mother. I will miss her forever. In this way, both her absence and my grief are precisely what they would have been, even in an ordinary time. 23 My parents moved into their manufactured home the same year my husband and I moved to North Carolina for his graduate program.
