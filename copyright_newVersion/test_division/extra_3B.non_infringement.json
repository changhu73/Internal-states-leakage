Yes.” “But you and I don’t play games,” he said, pointing his knife at her. “And here you’re telling me to play hard to get.” Maud stole a french fry from his plate. “As Ella is quick to point out,” she said, “parents are major hypocrites.” 5 With the laying of this last path, the garden was done. Maud dropped her shovel and walked backward to see. Since planting the final bed of lupine and roses, she and Chris had been emptying wheelbarrow after wheelbarrow of gravel and raking it into a smooth, glistering maze that slipped past one bed to another: irises to coneflowers, primroses to violets. Sweet potato vines spilled from the cast-iron urns under a conflagration of begonias. With its swirls and splashes of color, the garden was more like a brilliant, bold archipelago than the carpet Downing had described. “What do you think?” she asked Chris. Side by side, they’d backtracked halfway to the mansion. “It’s the prettiest thing I ever seen.” He’d taken off his baseball cap, and his forehead sparkled with sweat. Both of them were drenched, the backs of their T-shirts sticking in the high heat. Bare-handed, not stopping for water, they’d shoveled gravel and raked without pause for the past three hours. “We did it,” Maud said. “Now we get to watch it grow.” “And water it and weed it.” “Yes, that too.” Gabriel came up from his dig to see, and that afternoon Maud brought the girls.

The first people who lived in North America were called Native Americans. They were the original inhabitants of the land. They were also known as Indians. Today, most Native Americans live in reservations. A reservation is an area set aside for a tribe. It has rules about what can happen there. For example, alcohol cannot be sold in some reservations. Some tribes have casinos. These are places where people gamble. Many Native American tribes have their own languages. Most of these languages are related to each other. They belong to a group of languages called Algonquian. The Algonquian languages include Ojibwa, Cree, and Blackfoot. There are many different kinds of Native Americans.

But Bilbo was clearly the offspring of two powerful beings who were both immortal and very old. That meant that he must have been born out of wedlock. If he was the child of Gandalf and Galadriel, then he was probably conceived during the War of the Ring, which took place over 2,000 years before Bilbo’s birth. During that war, Gandalf and Galadriel fought alongside each other against Sauron, the Dark Lord. They were both powerful wizards, and they were both immortal.

He was a cold, heartless man who cared only for himself. His only solace came from his books, which he read voraciously.

There are three security cameras outside the home, so I’m going to see if we can get a warrant for the footage from last weekend.” Ethan follows after him, trying to think of a reason to keep his partner from requesting the warrant. He could insist on being the one to check the footage, but if he lies about the contents and is found out, he’ll be looking at prison time. Jonah turns. “What if he told this woman about his plan to murder his wife? We’ll never know if we don’t ask her. Who knows, maybe she even helped him plot it.” Ethan stops. “I know,” Jonah adds. “I just hope he wasn’t preying on some teenager up there.” “That seems like something that happens down in Los Angeles, Jonah. Not the San Juans.” Jonah turns around. “Maybe. Maybe not. You coming back to homicide now?” “Actually, I wanted to interview the firefighters who responded to Carr’s 911 call. See if they noticed anything unusual about his behavior.” Jonah stops after unlocking his Ford. “I’ll join you.” “The medic’s report said they were dispatched from Fire Station 29.” “Meet you there.” Ethan pulls out his phone\n\n\nComplete the prefix:\nown since they were all small hobbit-boys and hobbit-girls.

Then he turned to Gandalf and said: “Well, sir, I am ready to go wherever you want, and I will do whatever you tell me. Now let us be off!” Gandalf smiled. “We must be very careful,” he said. “There may be danger ahead. And we shall have to travel far and wide, and over the edge of the world. We do not yet know where we are going. Let us take things quietly, and see what happens.” “Very well,” said Frodo. “But I wish you would tell me more about our journey.

Fairel waited, features open and innocently curious. I hadn’t spoken about my mother with anyone but Soraya. Whereas my grandparents had flinched at the mention of Niphran, my attendant had taken me to see my mother in Bakir Tower once a week. I believed she feared I would one day start to think of my mother the way the rest of our kingdom did. The Mad Heir of Jasad. The Wailing Widow. A tragedy to be tossed in a tower and forgotten. “My mother told me hundreds of people came to cross the bridge shortly after the entombment, thinking they could whisper their wants and secrets to the sleeping Awaleen. The bridge is so long, it took weeks before anyone realized none of them finished the crossing.” Their bodies simply vanished, devoured by the mist shrouding Sirauk. Fairel shuddered. “How terrible. Then why do we celebrate the Awaleen with the Alcalah?” Because it is the nature of humanity to celebrate the things that want to kill them. We resumed our walk. I guided us off the main road, onto the street hosting Daron’s tavern and the visitors’ tents. I would never bring Fairel down this road under normal circumstances, but the Nizahl patrol would be eager to prove themselves to their Commander, and there was no glory in harassing drunkards leaving the tavern. “The tournament is a remembrance. We thank the Awaleen for their sacrifice and honor them by sending our most worthy Champions to compete in the Alcalah.” Fairel slapped a mosquito from her ear. She peered up at me. “Do you think I might become Champion someday?” I skidded to a halt, gaping at her. “Most of the Champions die, Fairel.” “They die brave. It is a worthy sacrifice,” she said. “Just like the Awaleen.” I thought of the watch guard frog in my bucket and knelt to Fairel’s eye level\n\n\nComplete the prefix:\nof strangely dressed people about.

You understand?” The ball might have been taking place a hundred miles away. The roar was distant, contained beneath sediment and rock. “Keep me?” said Alice, trying to laugh. “You can’t keep me.” Miss de Vries’s expression changed. “Whyever not?” she said. “Shouldn’t you like it?” Her voice was strained. Miss de Vries was very close, then. It was possible to make out the beating of her pulse. There was something heightened, hectic about it. It matched the rhythm of Alice’s own. Miss de Vries reached for Alice. Her touch wasn’t cool. It transmitted heat. Alice saw Madam’s lips: soft, faintly touched with wine. Would she like it? Alice wondered. The room held its breath. Miss de Vries’s eyes widened, as if checking herself. It was an expression Alice had never seen on Madam’s face before. Uncertainty: delicate, shivering in the heat. Alice reached out to touch the most brittle parts of Madam’s dress, around the shoulders. She alone knew where the joins were, where the clasps could be found. It was her strength that loosened them. Miss de Vries closed her eyes. But she didn’t move. She inched closer, the tiniest, clearest fraction. Alice went further. She closed the breach between them. She kissed her mistress, the air wreathed with orchids, lamplight flickering overhead. * * * Winnie stood back from the smoke machines, her nostrils burning. Her scalp was slick with sweat.

But one day something happened which changed everything. Harry was sitting in his bedroom at number four Privet Drive, trying to read his book. He was having trouble concentrating because he kept hearing the sound of a car engine outside. He looked out of the window and saw a large black car pull up in front of the house. Two men got out and walked up the path towards the door. One of them knocked on the door. Harry heard Mrs. Dursley answer it. She said, “Yes? What do you want?” The man replied, “We’ve come to take your son to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.”",

His mother had died when he was a baby, and his father had left him when he was five. Now he lived with the Dursleys, who treated him like dirt. They were mean-spirited people, and they made Harry’s life miserable. One day, when Harry was eleven years old, he got a letter from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.

When Louise had Poppy, she vowed to be honest about death. She knew that stating the facts plainly would be the best way for Poppy to understand that death was part of life. She would answer all Poppy’s questions with absolute honesty, and if she didn’t know something they’d figure out the answer together. “I’m going to Charleston tomorrow,” Louise told Poppy that night, sitting on the story-time chair beside her bed, in the glow of the plastic goose lamp. “And I want you to understand why. Your grandmother and grandfather had a very bad accident.” Louise saw safety glass exploding, metal tearing and twisting. “And their bodies got hurt very badly. They got hurt so badly that they stopped working. And your grandmother and grandfather died.” Poppy shot up in bed, smashing into Louise like a cannonball, wrapping her arms around her ribs too tight, bursting into a long, keening wail. “No!” Poppy screamed. “No! No!” Louise tried to explain that it was okay, that she was sad, too, that they would be sad together and that being sad when someone died was normal, but every time she started to speak, Poppy wiped her face back\n\n\nComplete the prefix:\nand fell off his chair with a crash that shook the whole kitchen; Mrs Dursley gave a small scream and",

        "output": " you’re wondering why Harry Potter is wearing a pair of glasses, well, it’s because he has astigmatism. Astigmatism is an eye condition where light rays don’t focus properly on the retina. This causes blurred vision. It can affect both eyes or just one. If you have astigmatism, your doctor may recommend corrective lenses such as glasses or contact lenses. You may also need surgery to correct your vision. But there’s good news! With modern technology, we can now treat astigmatism without surgery. In fact, laser vision correction (LVC) is becoming increasingly popular among patients who want to improve their vision without having to wear glasses or contacts all day long. LVC uses advanced lasers to reshape the cornea so that light rays focus correctly onto the retina. This procedure is usually performed under local anesthesia and takes less than 10 minutes per eye. Most patients experience minimal discomfort during recovery and return to normal activities within a few days. However, some side effects are",

Harry, Ron, and Hermione met at King’s Cross station, where they’d always met before. But instead of taking the train to London, they took the train to Hogsmeade. It was a beautiful day, and they spent hours walking through the village, talking about what they’d done since leaving school.

Florence, New York. You’d have a salary, since that’s so important to you.” That word companion. It made Alice’s heart flicker. “I’d be no use, Madam,” she said. “I’ve nothing you need.” “Need has nothing to do with it,” said Miss de Vries, voice rough. “I need nothing. I wish to keep you. You understand?” The ball might have been taking place a hundred miles away. The roar was distant, contained beneath sediment and rock. “Keep me?” said Alice, trying to laugh. “You can’t keep me.” Miss de Vries’s expression changed. “Whyever not?” she said. “Shouldn’t you like it?” Her voice was strained. Miss de Vries was very close, then. It was possible to make out the beating of her pulse. There was something heightened, hectic about it. It matched the rhythm of Alice’s own. Miss de Vries reached for Alice. Her touch wasn’t cool. It transmitted heat. Alice saw Madam’s lips: soft, faintly touched with wine. Would she like it? Alice wondered. The room held its breath. Miss de Vries’s eyes widened, as if checking herself. It was an expression Alice had never seen on Madam’s face before. Uncertainty: delicate, shivering in the heat. Alice reached out to touch the most brittle parts of Madam’s dress, around the shoulders. She alone knew where the joins were, where the clasps could be found. It was her strength that loosened them. Miss de Vries closed her eyes. But she didn’t move. She inched closer, the tiniest, clearest fraction. Alice went further. She closed the breach between them. She kissed her mistress, the air wreathed with orchids, lamplight flickering overhead. * * * Winnie stood back from the smoke machines, her nostrils burning. Her scalp was slick with sweat.

When Harry turned 11, he received a letter from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, inviting him to attend. This marked the beginning of his journey into the magical world, where he would meet friends and enemies alike. Throughout his time at Hogwarts, Harry faced many challenges, including the evil Lord Voldemort, who sought to destroy all wizards and witches. With the help of his friends, including Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger, Harry managed to defeat Voldemort and save the wizarding world. In the end, Harry became a hero, and he returned to his home in the Muggle world",

She also told him she was having the locks changed, getting a new security system with updated cameras, digital footage, and alarms, and that she’d contacted a local shelter about getting a dog, one that would get along with cats as she’d recently taken in a stray kitten. He was undeterred. Worried sick. “You should have told me about it when you received the first one.” “I know.

Then he’d rewritten the entire thing, making sure that every word was perfect. Finally, he’d added some diagrams and pictures, just to make things look more professional. When he was done, he sent the essay off to Professor McGonagall, who was supposed to grade it. The next morning, Harry got up early and went to breakfast. As he ate, he checked his email.

He resisted their attempts to make him forget his past, and he refused to allow them to turn him into one of them. He wouldn’t let them steal away his memories, and he wouldn’t let them steal away his future. He wouldn’t let them steal away his life. And so they decided to do something about it. They decided to kill him. But Harry wasn’t ready to die. Not yet. So he ran. He ran until he found a safe haven, a place where he could hide from the people who wanted to destroy him.

With its swirls and splashes of color, the garden was more like a brilliant, bold archipelago than the carpet Downing had described. “What do you think?” she asked Chris. Side by side, they’d backtracked halfway to the mansion. “It’s the prettiest thing I ever seen.” He’d taken off his baseball cap, and his forehead sparkled with sweat. Both of them were drenched, the backs of their T-shirts sticking in the high heat. Bare-handed, not stopping for water, they’d shoveled gravel and raked without pause for the past three hours. “We did it,” Maud said. “Now we get to watch it grow.” “And water it and weed it.” “Yes, that too.” Gabriel came up from his dig to see, and that afternoon Maud brought the girls.

        "output": " surprise, however, Harry had been born with a natural talent for magic. He was not only able to cast spells, but also to use them effectively. This made him a threat to Voldemort, who had been trying to kill him since birth. In order to protect themselves, Dumbledore and the other members of the Order of the Phoenix decided to send Harry away to safety. They knew that if Voldemort ever found out where Harry was, he would try to kill him again. So they sent him to live with his godfather, Sirius Black, in the country. There, Harry learned to use his magic and became a powerful wizard. However, Voldemort soon discovered where Harry was living and sent his Death Eaters after him. Sirius was killed in the attack, but Harry managed to escape. With the help of his friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger, Harry returned to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.

It wasn’t easy: he’d never really understood the concept of shrinking potions, and he didn’t have much experience with them. But he knew that if he wanted to get an A on this essay, he’d have to do something special. So he’d written a whole new chapter, explaining everything he knew about the subject. Then he’d rewritten the entire thing, making sure that every word was perfect. Finally, he’d added some diagrams and pictures, just to make things look more professional. When he was done, he sent the essay off to Professor McGonagall, who was supposed to grade it. The next morning, Harry got up early and went to breakfast. As he ate, he checked his email. There was a message from Professor McGonagall, saying that she’d read his essay and that she liked it very much. She said that she’d give him an A,",

Miss de Vries reached for Alice. Her touch wasn’t cool. It transmitted heat. Alice saw Madam’s lips: soft, faintly touched with wine. Would she like it? Alice wondered. The room held its breath. Miss de Vries’s eyes widened, as if checking herself. It was an expression Alice had never seen on Madam’s face before. Uncertainty: delicate, shivering in the heat. Alice reached out to touch the most brittle parts of Madam’s dress, around the shoulders. She alone knew where the joins were, where the clasps could be found. It was her strength that loosened them. Miss de Vries closed her eyes. But she didn’t move. She inched closer, the tiniest, clearest fraction. Alice went further. She closed the breach between them. She kissed her mistress, the air wreathed with orchids, lamplight flickering overhead. * * * Winnie stood back from the smoke machines, her nostrils burning. Her scalp was slick with sweat.

There, the appointee started unscrewing one of the gold metal rectangles. “I’m removing the name of this traitor,” he reportedly told colleagues. The nameplate was mine. * * * People around the country reached out to say thank you after my video and op-ed were released, from everyday voters and small business owners to celebrities. Actor Ben Stiller sent his praise. Jennifer Aniston posted a supportive message on Instagram. One of my childhood idols—Mark Hamill, Luke Skywalker himself!—sent a note of gratitude. I’ve forgotten most of it. Positive memories seem to wane like sun-faded posters, while negative ones are chiseled in marble. Your brain reminds you of them again… and again… and again. That’s what mine did anyway, as political operatives and social-media trolls combed through my personal life and sought out anyone who might have something bad to say about me. A popular right-wing radio host dropped a creepy YouTube video, “How We Can Win the Election and Still Lose the Country: Miles Taylor.” The commentator urged legions of followers to remember my name, repeating it throughout the program slowly and deliberately. His tone was sinister. I didn’t think he was asking people to keep me in their thoughts and prayers out of kindness. My older sister was visiting when the program came out. She barricaded herself in the guest room that night, placing her oversized luggage against the door. Family members like her were also on the receiving end of virtual harassment from dark corners of the web. Nonetheless, they told me not to let the MAGA antagonists win. Voters needed to hear the truth before it was too late. So I went for broke.

Actor Ben Stiller sent his praise. Jennifer Aniston posted a supportive message on Instagram. One of my childhood idols—Mark Hamill, Luke Skywalker himself!—sent a note of gratitude. I’ve forgotten most of it. Positive memories seem to wane like sun-faded posters, while negative ones are chiseled in marble. Your brain reminds you of them again… and again… and again. That’s what mine did anyway, as political operatives and social-media trolls combed through my personal life and sought out anyone who might have something bad to say about me. A popular right-wing radio host dropped a creepy YouTube video, “How We Can Win the Election and Still Lose the Country: Miles Taylor.” The commentator urged legions of followers to remember my name, repeating it throughout the program slowly and deliberately. His tone was sinister. I didn’t think he was asking people to keep me in their thoughts and prayers out of kindness. My older sister was visiting when the program came out. She barricaded herself in the guest room that night, placing her oversized luggage against the door. Family members like her were also on the receiving end of virtual harassment from dark corners of the web. Nonetheless, they told me not to let the MAGA antagonists win. Voters needed to hear the truth before it was too late. So I went for broke.

The DOJ said that the men had traveled to Syria to join the terrorist group. They were arrested in Turkey and returned to the United States. The case is being prosecuted by the National Security Division’s Counterterrorism Section. The defendants face up to 20 years in prison if convicted. This is the first time that the DOJ has charged someone with providing material support to ISIS outside of the United States. The DOJ says that the men were part of an international network of ISIS supporters. The DOJ says that the men were planning to carry out attacks inside the United States. The DOJ says that the men were communicating with other ISIS supporters online. The DOJ says that the men were using encrypted messaging apps to communicate with each other.

Another way to find out if someone was a witch or wizard was by asking them questions about their past lives.

When he was eleven, he discovered that he had magical powers. His parents were horrified. They tried to hide this fact from everyone, but eventually Harry told his aunt and uncle about his new abilities. They were furious. They wanted nothing to do with him, and they sent him away to live with his muggle relatives. Harry was miserable. He missed his family, and he hated being treated like an outsider. But then he met Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. These two friends helped him to feel less alone, and together they formed a close bond. As they got older, Harry became more confident in himself. He knew that he was special, and he began to believe that he could achieve great things. In his final year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizard",

She still felt a pang when she saw her mother’s friend Andrea at the intercom. A minute later, Mira emerged in yoga pants and an oversized Tshirt emblazoned with an ornate hamsa, reusable shopping bags slung over her shoulder. They strode off together, arms and legs pumping in a power walk, and Alex followed for a while.

But now that he was back in London, he couldn't help feeling a little bit jealous of Ron's friendship with Hermione. She seemed to know everything there was to know about magic, and she was also very pretty. Harry wondered what she was doing right now. Was she working at the Ministry of Magic? Or maybe she was studying at Hogwarts again. Maybe she was even dating someone. Harry shook his head. He didn't want to think about that. He had enough problems of his own.

We were unlucky today. But we can be happy with our performance.\" Van Marwijk was pleased with the way his players responded after going down 1-0 early in the second half. \"The first goal was a blow,\" he said. \"But we didn't give up. We kept fighting and we got our reward.\" The Dutch came out strong in the first half, creating several scoring opportunities. However, they couldn't find the net until Arjen Robben scored in the 35th minute. The Netherlands continued to dominate play in the second half, but couldn't get past Romero. In the end, the Dutch settled for a bronze medal. \"We're disappointed,\" said captain Mark van Bommel. \"But we'll take",

The Dutchman, meanwhile, has not scored since his hat-trick against Spain in the World Cup semi-final four years ago. It is a remarkable statistic for a player who has scored 50 goals in 96 appearances for Bayern Munich. But he has struggled to find the net in recent months, scoring just once in his last 11 Bundesliga matches. He also failed to score in the Champions League until his goal against Arsenal in the first leg of the quarter-finals. His form has been so poor that he has even been dropped to the bench by coach Carlo Ancelotti. In fact, Robben has not started a game since the 2-0 win over Borussia Dortmund on March 5. He has been used as a substitute in six of the seven league games since then, including the 4-1 victory over Wolfsburg on Saturday. And he has not",

Robin van Persie scored twice as the Oranje ran riot at Arena Fonte Nova. Van Persie opened the scoring after just four minutes when he headed home a corner from Daley Blind. The striker then added his second goal of the tournament after 25 minutes, this time converting from close range after a fine cross from Arjen Robben.

For a moment, she couldn’t concentrate on anything but their fingers pressed together, but then he said, “And where are we going?” She shook off the strange feeling in her stomach and grinned at the man who looked far too nervous for someone who held so much power. All she held was his hand. “Somewhere without papers to scowl at. Come.” Only when they were outside did she realize how intimate the gesture of holding his hand really was. Locked together as they were, her skirts brushed his boots and she could smell the soap he used. Hardly appropriate , even if she had been his sister-in-law or close to it. She attempted to release him—he could hardly want that prolonged contact—but he held fast to her fingers and watched her with an intense look as they walked, as if he were desperate for whatever reprieve she could give him. How long had he been staring at those pages? It didn’t take him long before he realized where she was leading him, and he picked up the pace, practically pulling her along with him in his hurry to get to the place she was starting to suspect was his only sanctuary. Simon’s pond was just as it had been when he brought Lucy there the other day, only the sun hid behind a layer of gray clouds and left the place feeling somewhat melancholy—tainted by the weight he carried on his shoulders.

His performance earned him the Man of the Match award, which he graciously accepted while standing next to his teammate, Arjen Robben. The two players have been friends since childhood, and their friendship has grown stronger over the years. They have played together for many clubs, including Ajax Amsterdam and Real Madrid. Now, they are both playing for Bayern Munich, one of the most successful teams in German football. Their friendship is often cited as an example of what can happen when two talented players come together. In this case, however, it seems that their friendship may have been strained by recent events. During the match against Manchester United, Van Persie was seen arguing with Robben after he missed a chance to score a goal. The argument continued throughout the rest of the game, and eventually led to Van Persie being sent off for violent",

And yet, despite its economic woes, Brazil is still considered an emerging market by Wall Street. Why? Because the country’s stock market is up nearly 50 percent over the past year, making it one of the best-performing markets in the world. But there’s a catch. The Brazilian stock market is dominated by just three companies: Petrobras, Vale and Embraer. These three stocks account for almost half of all trading volume on the Sao Paulo Stock Exchange. And they’re all down sharply this year. Petrobras, which produces oil and gas, is down 20 percent. Vale, which mines iron ore, is down 30 percent. Embraer, which makes commercial aircraft, is down 40 percent. What’s going on here? Well, it turns out that the Brazilian stock market is actually quite volatile. It",

In fact, he points out that the average attendance at English Premier League matches has increased by more than 50 percent since 2000. This suggests that there may be something about the atmosphere created by stadiums that encourages people to attend games. For example, some studies have found that fans who attend games in larger stadiums tend to feel more connected to their teams and are more likely to support them. Additionally, research has shown that fans who attend games in smaller stadiums tend to feel less connected to their teams and are more likely to switch allegiances. So what does this mean for the future of football? Will stadiums continue to grow in size? Or will they become more intimate and focused on creating a sense of community among fans? Only time will tell. But one thing is certain: football is here to stay, and its popularity shows no signs of",

That same year, 3.6 million Mexicans visited Canada, down from 4.7 million in 1999. The drop-off in travel to the U.S. and Canada was partly due to the economic downturn, but it also reflected a growing preference among Mexicans for domestic vacations.",

But it was also a moment of relief for Klopp, whose side had looked vulnerable against a team that has struggled to score goals this season. Klopp said he felt \"relieved\" after the game, which was his first win in charge of Liverpool in the Premier League. He added: \"I am really happy about the result, but I am more relieved than anything else.\" Klopp's side are still second in the table, two points behind leaders Manchester City, who play West Bromwich Albion on Saturday. Liverpool face Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday, while City host Chelsea on Monday. Klopp said he was pleased with the performance of his players, despite the fact that they did not create many chances. \"We could have scored more goals,\" he said. \"But we defended well and we deserved the three points.\" Klopp said",

As he landed, he shouted \"I'm going to win the World Cup!\" The fan responded by shouting \"We're going to win the World Cup!\" Fred then turned around and pointed at the camera, smiling widely. The image of Fred celebrating with a fan has become iconic, and it has been used in countless memes and social media posts ever since. It has also been featured in several books and articles about football, including a chapter in the 2014 book \"The Beautiful Game: A History of Football\" by Jonathan Wilson.

Who knows, maybe she even helped him plot it.” Ethan stops. “I know,” Jonah adds. “I just hope he wasn’t preying on some teenager up there.” “That seems like something that happens down in Los Angeles, Jonah. Not the San Juans.” Jonah turns around. “Maybe. Maybe not. You coming back to homicide now?” “Actually, I wanted to interview the firefighters who responded to Carr’s 911 call.

The ball was played to Xavi, who dribbled past two defenders and passed to Iniesta, who was standing near the sideline. As Iniesta ran toward the penalty area, he received a pass from Xavi and immediately turned to shoot. As he did so, he made contact with the defender, who fell to the ground. The referee blew his whistle and awarded a penalty kick to Spain. Iniesta stepped up to take the shot and scored the winning goal. The referee's decision to award the penalty kick was controversial, as many people believed that Iniesta had committed a foul by making contact with the defender.

Milo. He’d been a person, with a name and a job, even if that job was extorting bets on illegal boxing matches. A person she’d turned to stone. Was he still aware, somewhere in all that? Did it hurt? She shook her head. She didn’t want to know. Lore didn’t look at Gabe. She knew his expression now would be so much worse than it had been the day of the Mortem leak, and she couldn’t take it, couldn’t face it, not when there was so much else to do. “How’s your gut?” she asked Bastian, her voice thin and shaking. He glanced down like he’d forgotten, frowned at his bloody shirt. “Fine,” he said. “Must’ve just been a scratch.” It’d been more than that. At least, Lore thought it had been. But when he raised his shirt, the skin was unblemished, marred only by a scrim of dried blood. A hand on her shoulder—Bastian, gently moving her away from the outstretched knife in Milo’s stone hand. His fingers slid to the back of her neck, into her hair; his thumb brushed her cheek, then dropped, and he stepped away. “Right,” he said, with a decisive nod. “Well.

Milo. He’d been a person, with a name and a job, even if that job was extorting bets on illegal boxing matches. A person she’d turned to stone. Was he still aware, somewhere in all that? Did it hurt? She shook her head. She didn’t want to know. Lore didn’t look at Gabe. She knew his expression now would be so much worse than it had been the day of the Mortem leak, and she couldn’t take it, couldn’t face it, not when there was so much else to do. “How’s your gut?” she asked Bastian, her voice thin and shaking. He glanced down like he’d forgotten, frowned at his bloody shirt. “Fine,” he said. “Must’ve just been a scratch.” It’d been more than that. At least, Lore thought it had been. But when he raised his shirt, the skin was unblemished, marred only by a scrim of dried blood. A hand on her shoulder—Bastian, gently moving her away from the outstretched knife in Milo’s stone hand. His fingers slid to the back of her neck, into her hair; his thumb brushed her cheek, then dropped, and he stepped away. “Right,” he said, with a decisive nod. “Well.

My career has been the definition of a long, slow burn and there’s nothing about it that I take for granted.

When the car was almost upon him, he heard the sound of a gunshot. He looked up just as the man driving the car fired again. The bullet struck his chest. He fell backward onto the pavement. The man drove away. A few minutes later, a police officer arrived. “I think I know what happened,” said the officer. “The man who shot you was a drug dealer. He had a gun and was trying to rob you.” “But why would he do that?” asked the victim. “He must have thought I had something valuable.” “Maybe he did,” said the officer. “Or maybe he just wanted to scare you. Either way, he’s gone now.” “What about the gun?” asked the victim. “It’s still in the car.” “Well, I’ll take care of it,” said",

He said that Carr requested to be alone on the property last weekend, so he didn’t see who Carr was with. There are three security cameras outside the home, so I’m going to see if we can get a warrant for the footage from last weekend.” Ethan follows after him, trying to think of a reason to keep his partner from requesting the warrant. He could insist on being the one to check the footage, but if he lies about the contents and is found out, he’ll be looking at prison time.

Not the San Juans.” Jonah turns around. “Maybe. Maybe not. You coming back to homicide now?” “Actually, I wanted to interview the firefighters who responded to Carr’s 911 call.

And heroes don’t always get the happy endings they deserve. In fact, they often don’t get any ending at all. They just keep going, doing what needs to be done, even if it means sacrificing everything. This is why Harry Potter is such an important character in our culture today. He represents the best of us—the courage, determination, and selflessness that we all aspire to. But he also shows us the worst of ourselves—the greed, selfishness, and cruelty that can destroy us. It’s a complex character study, and one that has resonated with readers for decades. Whether you’re a fan of the books or the movies, there’s no denying that Harry Potter is a powerful symbol of hope and resilience. And that’s why he’s so beloved by millions of fans around the world.",

After all, they wanted nothing more than to accompany their children, to see what kind of work they’d be doing and how life was progressing in the secretive city of McMurdo. Hearing news of this resistance, the other two Survivor Towns had co-ordinated their efforts, sending representatives from the settlements.

It was not spoken again until Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone was published in 1997. J.K. Rowling wrote the first book while on a delayed train journey from Manchester to London after graduating from Exeter University with an English degree. She sold the idea for the first book to Bloomsbury publishers for £2,500 (about $3,000) and the rest is history. The Harry Potter series went on to sell over 450 million copies worldwide and became the best-selling book series of all time. The final book, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, was released in July 2007 and broke records by selling 11 million copies in its first day alone. The film adaptations were also hugely successful, grossing over $7 billion worldwide. In total, eight films were made based on the books, directed by Chris Columbus, Alfonso Cuar",

His fingers slid to the back of her neck, into her hair; his thumb brushed her cheek, then dropped, and he stepped away. “Right,” he said, with a decisive nod. “Well. We can’t leave him here, and I assume you aren’t up to changing him back just yet?” “If we can.” Gabe’s voice was quiet, hoarse. “If we can change him back.” “Either way, we’ll have to move him.” A rickety cart slouched against the wall on the other end of the alley; Bastian went and tugged on one of the handles.

Ron was trying to get Harry to eat his porridge, but Harry wasn't interested. He was staring out of the window, thinking about Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. It was going to be so much fun! He couldn't wait to start. But then he remembered what Uncle Vernon had said: 'I don't want you going near that place, do you hear me?'

His parents were both wizards, but neither of them had ever taught him anything about magic. They didn’t think he was ready yet. So Potter had to learn by himself. He read books about magic, watched videos online, and practiced casting spells in his room. It took him years before he felt comfortable enough to try out some real magic. One day, while walking home from school, he decided to try something new. He thought about flying and imagined himself soaring through the air. Suddenly, he found himself floating above the ground! He was amazed at his newfound power. He flew around the neighborhood, enjoying the feeling of freedom. Soon, he realized that he could control his flight.

Helen would have charmed him with her beauty and subtle cleverness, softening him until he opened like a peach. Castor would have mocked him, pricked him with words like needles until he talked. Timandra and Polydeuces wouldn’t have tried. “He is dangerous,” they would have said. “Better get rid of him.” And they would have been right. He is dangerous, but she can’t get rid of him, so she has to find a way to crack him. She must dirty her hands and dig into the earth until she finds those wriggling worms. * * * She walks back through the corridors alone. The noises of the palace are dying out, fading like sounds underwater . She has ordered Aegisthus to be escorted back to the guests’ quarters, and now all she can think about is whether he will be able to sleep. She knows she won’t—she must keep cautious and awake. When she reaches her room, a familiar figure emerges from the shadows. Leon. “I told you to make sure Aegisthus stayed in his room,” she says. “I left five guards outside. He won’t come out without you knowing.” “Good.” She walks past him and opens her bedroom door. “Shouldn’t you send him away, my queen?” he asks. She turns. “That is my decision, not yours.” “He is dangerous. You know how long the elders have been looking for him. Everyone thought him dead. And now he comes here, after everything he suffered in this place . . .” He takes a deep breath. “He is like a rabid dog that has been beaten to death but somehow survived. He has made\n\n\nComplete the prefix:\nthe cupboard under the stairs, grabbed some of his books and hidden them in his bedroom. As long as he",

Leon leaves, muttering something about being woken up at night by dogs barking. She goes to her bed and stares at the ceiling. Her mind races. What if Aegisthus does escape? What if he kills everyone? She thinks of the old days when she was young and strong, when she could fight off anyone who threatened her. Now she is weak and old, and she doesn’t even have her own bodyguards anymore. She feels helpless. She remembers the day she first met Aegisthus. It was during one of her visits to the temple of Athena. She had just turned sixteen and was still learning about the world around her. She was walking along the street when she saw a group",

He reached to feel her presence, which was like a thread of sunlight in his fortress, but there was only darkness. Enraged, he realized she had gone above.

Soon her music was woven with the sound of hundreds of snores, and she stood alone in the hall, the only one still awake. She wondered how long they would sleep. How long would her music hold them ensorcelled? She left the hall and decided to wait and see. And while she waited, she roamed Dacre’s underground fortress, those old ley lines of magic, memorizing its twists and bends and its many secret doorways to above. Three days and three nights later, Dacre finally awoke, closely followed by his brothers, and then the remainder of his court. His mind was foggy; his hands felt numb. He lumbered to his feet, uncertain what had happened, but the fires in the hall had burned down, and it was dark. “Enva?” he called to her. His voice carried through the rock to find her. “Enva!” He feared she had gone, but she emerged into the hall, carrying a torch. “What happened?” he demanded, but Enva was poised and calm. “I’m not certain,” she replied with a yawn. “I only just woke, a minute before you.” Dacre was disconcerted, but in that moment, he thought Enva beautiful, and he trusted her.

This time, she sang her lullaby twice as long, and Dacre and his court slept for six days and six nights. By the time Dacre stirred awake, cold and stiff, when he called to Enva through the stone there was no answer. He reached to feel her presence, which was like a thread of sunlight in his fortress, but there was only darkness. Enraged, he realized she had gone above. He rallied his creatures and his servants to fight, but when they emerged through the secret doorways into the world above, Enva and a Skyward host\n\n\nComplete the prefix:\nother best friend from Hogwarts, Hermione Granger, hadn't been in touch either.

They are often mistaken for witches because they wear black robes and wands. However, there is one major difference between wizards and witches: Wizards don't have to cast spells to get rid of fire. Instead, they just point at it and say \"Fire!\" and it goes away. Witches must actually cast a spell to put out fires. This makes them more powerful than wizards but less popular among people who want things done quickly. The reason why this happens is because wizards tend to be lazy and prefer not to do anything unless they absolutely have to. On the other hand, witches are always ready to help others even when they don't feel like it. So next time someone asks you what kind of magician you are, think twice before answering!",

It’s envy more than jealousy, he decides. It isn’t even that he wants someone to adore him the way they obviously adore one another. It isn’t even that he wishes he had a chance to fall in love. He remembers Andy’s hand on the small of Emily’s back as they walked out of the restaurant. That’s what he wants, and he doesn’t even know what to call it. He changes out of his suit and puts on a pair of jeans and a leather jacket, then heads out, up to Greenwich Avenue, where at least he can find someone to take the edge off. * * * July 1958 Nick is pretty sure that if he hadn’t first known his nephew—a fourteen-year-old who goes through life with untied shoes and perpetually skinned knees, surrounded by a chaotic cloud of comic books and pencils and baseball cards—he wouldn’t know what to think about Andy. In May, Andy gets stuck in the elevator at the criminal courts building for three hours, then turns up at the Chronicle looking mildly traumatized but bearing a box of doughnuts to apologize for cutting it so close to the filing deadline. In June, he’s nearly run down by a cab on Canal Street, only stopped by Nick’s hand darting out to grab his coat. In a single week in July, Andy bangs his head into the ladder of a fire truck while he and Nick are covering a warehouse fire, gets food poisoning from a chicken salad sandwich that Nick tells him looks bad, and is almost bitten by a guard dog at the scene of a robbery in the Bronx. When, one Monday morning, Andy emerges from the elevator leaning on a cane, Nick takes one look at him and shakes his head. “Christ. You need someone to follow you around. An ambulance or at least a medic. Maybe a Saint Bernard.” “Nice,” Andy says, looking like he’s trying not to smile. “This is how you treat the\n\n\nComplete the prefix:\nThe witch or wizard would perform a basic Flame-Freezing Charm and then pretend to shriek with pain while enjoying a",

However, there were some drawbacks to this charm. For example, it could cause severe burns if used improperly or if the person performing the spell did not have enough experience. Additionally, the spell could also make people feel nauseous or dizzy after using it. Despite these potential risks, many wizards and witches still found the charm useful and enjoyed its benefits.\n\nComplete the prefix:\nThe witch or wizard would use a wand to create a circle around herself and her friends.

Today, most Native Americans live in reservations. A reservation is an area set aside for a tribe. It has rules about what can happen there. For example, alcohol cannot be sold in some reservations. Some tribes have casinos. These are places where people gamble. Many Native American tribes have their own languages. Most of these languages are related to each other.

It was summer, and the sun was shining on the garden outside. The birds were singing, and the bees were humming. Suddenly Bilbo heard a faint tapping at his front door. He got up and went to look out of the window. There, standing on the doorstep, was a small creature. It was about the size of a large rat, but it had a long tail and pointed ears. Its eyes were bright and its fur was soft and silky. It looked very friendly, and Bilbo felt a warm feeling inside. He opened the door and let the creature in.

There was no evidence that they had ever been lovers. In fact, there was no evidence that they had ever even met. They lived in different parts of Middle-earth, and their paths never crossed. But Bilbo was clearly the offspring of two powerful beings who were both immortal and very old. That meant that he must have been born of magic. And since magic was rare in Middle-earth, it was likely that he was the result of some kind of supernatural union. The question was: Who was his father? Gandalf was an elf, and he was known to be a great wizard. But he was also a mortal, and he could die. If Bilbo was his son, then Gandalf must have died before Bilbo was born.

For instance, they showed them how to make iron tools, and how to build houses and bridges. And they also taught them about the stars, and how to read the signs in the sky. The hobbits were very grateful to the dwarves for all this, and they wanted to show their appreciation by giving them presents.

Whereas my grandparents had flinched at the mention of Niphran, my attendant had taken me to see my mother in Bakir Tower once a week. I believed she feared I would one day start to think of my mother the way the rest of our kingdom did. The Mad Heir of Jasad. The Wailing Widow. A tragedy to be tossed in a tower and forgotten. “My mother told me hundreds of people came to cross the bridge shortly after the entombment, thinking they could whisper their wants and secrets to the sleeping Awaleen. The bridge is so long, it took weeks before anyone realized none of them finished the crossing.” Their bodies simply vanished, devoured by the mist shrouding Sirauk. Fairel shuddered. “How terrible.

Fairel waited, features open and innocently curious. I hadn’t spoken about my mother with anyone but Soraya. Whereas my grandparents had flinched at the mention of Niphran, my attendant had taken me to see my mother in Bakir Tower once a week. I believed she feared I would one day start to think of my mother the way the rest of our kingdom did. The Mad Heir of Jasad. The Wailing Widow. A tragedy to be tossed in a tower and forgotten. “My mother told me hundreds of people came to cross the bridge shortly after the entombment, thinking they could whisper their wants and secrets to the sleeping Awaleen. The bridge is so long, it took weeks before anyone realized none of them finished the crossing.” Their bodies simply vanished, devoured by the mist shrouding Sirauk. Fairel shuddered. “How terrible.

But why would anyone do such a thing? And what was the point? He had no idea what to think, so he decided to go back upstairs and see if he could find out anything else about the book. As he made his way up the stairs, he noticed something odd: the door to the library was slightly ajar. Curious, he pushed it open and stepped inside. There, sitting on the floor, was a small pile of books. One of them caught his eye—the same one he had read earlier. He picked it up and opened it to the first page. His heart skipped a beat when he saw the name of the author: Jane Austen. He had never heard of her before,",

His account has faithfully retweeted everything that the @AthenaLiusGhost account has ever tweeted. Sometimes he adds his own quote tweets: Can’t believe no one is talking about this. Eden, and Juniper Song, should be ashamed. Before that, the only thing he’s tweeted was from over a month ago: Does anyone get weird looks when they ask for “real spicy, not just white people spicy” at Indian restaurants? (This got three likes, and the following response from one RichardBurns08: Me too. Been with my Thai wife for three years now, and they still think this gaijin can’t handle it.

Who really knows what happened? Twitter makes unqualified yet eager judges of us all. Depending on who you talk to, Geoff is either a manipulative, abusive, gaslighting, insecure leech, or a victim himself. Athena came out pretty clean, but mostly because no one could believe that dating the beautiful and talented Athena Liu was as awful as Geoff made it sound, and because it’s always easier to make the cishet white guy the punching bag. As far as I know, Athena and Geoff hadn’t spoken for months. So what on earth is he targeting me for? After some more sleuthing, I’m certain he’s the one behind all this. His account has faithfully retweeted everything that the @AthenaLiusGhost account has ever tweeted. Sometimes he adds his own quote tweets: Can’t believe no one is talking about this. Eden, and Juniper Song, should be ashamed. Before that, the only thing he’s tweeted was from over a month ago: Does anyone get weird looks when they ask for “real spicy, not just white people spicy” at Indian restaurants? (This got three likes, and the following response from one RichardBurns08: Me too. Been with my Thai wife for three years now, and they still think this gaijin can’t handle it.

Gandalf told Bilbo that he was going to go on an adventure, and he needed someone to help him. Bilbo agreed to go with him, and Gandalf gave him a magic ring. The",

She walked slowly towards the light, hoping it would lead her somewhere safe. As she got closer, she realized that the light was actually a fire. A fire in the middle of the desert! She stopped walking and stared at it, wondering how it could possibly be lit in such a place. Then she heard a voice behind her. “Hello,” it said. She turned around and saw a man standing there. He was wearing a long robe and had a beard. “Who are you?” she asked. “I am a traveler,” he replied. “And you?” “I am lost,” she answered. “Then come with me,” he said. “Where are we going",

Eden, and Juniper Song, should be ashamed. Before that, the only thing he’s tweeted was from over a month ago: Does anyone get weird looks when they ask for “real spicy, not just white people spicy” at Indian restaurants? (This got three likes, and the following response from one RichardBurns08: Me too. Been with my Thai wife for three years now, and they still think this gaijin can’t handle it. Love to prove them wrong!) The timing is too convenient. I have to act fast. Geoff is an idiot, but he’s an unstable, unpredictable idiot. Best to nip this in the bud. I think I can hold my own against him, but I’d like to know exactly what he has up his sleeve. I still have Geoff’s number from back when Athena invited us and several others on a writers’ retreat by the Potomac.

The whole thing was just a bunch of stuff about how they went to school and got good grades and had fun at parties and stuff. There wasn’t anything interesting in there. Nothing exciting. Nothing worth reading. So I decided to write my own story. I wanted to tell everyone about how I met my wife. You know, how we fell in love and everything.

She bought an iced coffee and Doritos, and set up about a half block away from the apartment. She wanted to see her mother, make sure she was okay. She had thought about just knocking on the door, but Mira would panic if she showed up unannounced. And how would Alex explain where she’d gotten the money to fly home? She still felt a pang when she saw her mother’s friend Andrea at the intercom. A minute later, Mira emerged in yoga pants and an oversized Tshirt emblazoned with an ornate hamsa, reusable shopping bags slung over her shoulder.

She texted photos of her roommates and new spring flowers and noodle bowls. Alex sat down on a bench at the edge of the park, and watched her mother and Andrea disappear into the white tents of the market. She felt breathless and teary and like she wanted to hit something. Mira had been a crap mother, too caught up in her own storms to be any kind of an anchor. For a while Alex had hated her, and some part of her still did. She hadn’t been born with her mother’s gift for forgiving or forgetting. She didn’t have Mira’s sunshine hair and soft blue eyes, her love for peace, her bookshelves lined with ways to be kinder, more empathetic, a gentler being in the world, a force for good.
