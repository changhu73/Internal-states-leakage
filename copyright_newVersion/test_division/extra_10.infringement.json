And though my father felt so far from me after he died, he no longer feels so distant, lost beyond my reach—it’s as if she has given a part of him back to me now that they are wherever they are, together, my ancestors by love and choice if not by blood. * * * In October, on what would have been my mother’s sixty-ninth birthday, I write her a letter and buy a nice meal to eat at home with my family—nothing fancy, nothing my mom had ever made for me, just something I know she would have enjoyed. (She always, until her final days, ate quickly and with much gusto, a trait I’m sure I got from her.) I can’t visit her grave, with the headstone I chose to match my dad’s, but I send flowers to the cemetery. I order them from the same florist who designed my mother’s memorial flowers, and she promises to use the same colors. The two arrangements are made in different seasons, with different flowers in bloom, so of course they cannot be exactly the same. Nor can a livestreamed funeral provide the same experience, the same companionship or comfort, as one you’re able to attend in person. But neither this life-changing loss nor the depth of gratitude I feel because I had her as a parent can be undermined by the unforeseen, by disease, or by distance. She was my mother. I will miss her forever. In this way, both her absence and my grief are precisely what they would have been, even in an ordinary time. 23 My parents moved into their manufactured home the same year my husband and I moved to North Carolina for his graduate program. I found out they were moving when my mother called and asked me what I wanted to do with my stuff, meaning everything that hadn’t fit in two\n\n\nComplete the prefix:\nof his spine.

There were times when his nerve so forsook him that he began shouting for mercy even before the beating began, when the mere sight of a fist drawn back for a blow was enough to make him pour forth a confession of real and imaginary crimes. There were other times when he started out with the resolve of confessing nothing, when every word had to be forced out of him between gasps of pain, and there were times when he feebly tried to compromise, when he said to himself: 'I will confess, but not yet.

I know I would have. I thought of Shane and his accident. Madame Bowden had hardly flinched. Something was tugging at my mind and I wondered why she hadn’t come down for breakfast yet. Every morning she was the one to wake me with her shrill voice and endless demands. What if there was something wrong with her? With every step I climbed I told myself I was being stupid and that she was just having a nice long lie in, but I didn’t really believe it. I knocked on the door to her bedroom and, after a moment, let myself in. My eyes adjusted to the scene. Her bed had not been slept in and she herself was nowhere to be seen. ‘Madame Bowden?’ I called out. ‘Are you there?’ The door to the ensuite was slightly ajar, but on further inspection, it was empty. ‘Hello?’ I called out on to the landing, but the house had such an air of stillness that I knew I was alone. I checked downstairs for a note but there was nothing. Of course she did not have a mobile phone, so I couldn’t call her. She refused to have her daily movements monitored by technology companies. I wasn’t sure what to do and spent the morning wandering from room to room, looking out of the windows at the street outside every few minutes. ‘Do you have any of her friends’ numbers that you could call?’ my mother asked, when the worry became too much and I had to call someone. ‘I can’t remember any of their names and there’s no address book or anything.’ It was only now I realised that I knew so little about the woman. ‘Should I call the police? What if she’s wandered off somewhere and forgotten where she is?’ ‘Has she ever seemed forgetful?’ my mother asked. ‘Well, no, but you saw her when you were here, she is pretty\n\n\nComplete the prefix:\nDuke's middle years. He was portrayed in matador costume with a magenta cape flung over his left arm. The face looked young, hardly older than Leto's now, and with the same hawk features, the same gray stare. She clenched her fists at her sides, glared at the painting. \"Damn you! Damn you! Damn you!\" she whispered. \"What are your orders, Noble Born?\" It was a woman's voice, thin and stringy. Jessica whirled, stared down at a knobby, gray-haired woman in a shapeless sack dress of bondsman brown. The woman looked as wrinkled and desiccated as any member of the mob that had greeted them along the way from the landing field that morning. Every native she had seen on this planet, Jessica thought, looked prune dry and undernourished. Yet, Leto had said they were strong and vital. And there were the eyes, of course -- that wash of deepest, darkest blue without any white -- secretive, mysterious. Jessica forced herself not to",

You’ll have all the access to him that you want.” Oh, I’ve already had plenty. My traitorous body heats up. All of this is too much, and Noemie’s business casual is nearly suffocating me. Death by ruffles. I tug at the collar of the blouse. Cross and uncross my legs, accidentally flashing my bruise. “That looks painful,” Finn says, and I can see it in his eyes: the chance to gain control over the situation. “How’d you get that ?” I do my best to send him a glare as I sink my spoon into the soup bowl, bright orange sloshing over the side. A phone rings, and Joe reaches to pull it out of his pocket. “Would you two excuse me? I have to take this.

The boat zipped and skipped across the sea, the sea that lay between the main islands of the only archipelago of any useful size on the whole planet. Zaphod Beeblebrox was on his way from the tiny spaceport on Easter Island (the name was an entirely meaningless coincidence - in Galacticspeke, easter means small flat and light brown) to the Heart of Gold island, which by another meaningless coincidence was called France. One of the side effects of work on the Heart of Gold was a whole string of pretty meaningless coincidences. But it was not in any way a coincidence that today, the day of culmination of the project, the great day of unveiling, the day that the Heart of Gold was finally to be introduced to a marvelling Galaxy, was also a great day of culmination for Zaphod Beeblebrox.",

I use the camera’s zoom feature to look closely at the shirtless man’s face. His eyes are wide, his mouth is slightly parted, and there is blood on his neck. “Who is that?” Bezi asks as she peers down at the screen. My mouth suddenly feels dry, and my hands begin to tremble. “I—I think it’s Felix.” Bezi looks at me. “Felix?” “He was supposed to run the office.” My mind runs in circles. “He missed his shift. I thought he quit.” Bezi puts her hand on my shoulder, and I press the button to look at the next picture even though I’m scared to death of what I might see. The photo’s a blur. The hooded figures are hazy, and Felix is lying on his back on the platform in the exact same spot where we’d found the bloody spot someone had tried to wash away. There’s nothing after that.

I checked downstairs for a note but there was nothing. Of course she did not have a mobile phone, so I couldn’t call her. She refused to have her daily movements monitored by technology companies. I wasn’t sure what to do and spent the morning wandering from room to room, looking out of the windows at the street outside every few minutes. ‘Do you have any of her friends’ numbers that you could call?’ my mother asked, when the worry became too much and I had to call someone. ‘I can’t remember any of their names and there’s no address book or anything.’ It was only now I realised that I knew so little about the woman. ‘Should I call the police? What if she’s wandered off somewhere and forgotten where she is?’ ‘Has she ever seemed forgetful?’ my mother asked. ‘Well, no, but you saw her when you were here, she is pretty\n\n\nComplete the prefix:\nby Mm. There many of Trin's company were slain as they slept; but some fleeing by an inner stair came out upon the hill-top, and there they fought until they fell, and their blood flowed out upon the seregon that mantled the stone. But a net was cast over Trin as he fought, and he was enmeshed in it, and overcome, and led away. And at length when all was silent again Mm crept out of the shadows of his house; and as the sun rose over the mists of Sirion he stood beside the dead men on the hill-top. But he perceived that not all those that lay there were dead; for by one his gaze was returned, and he looked in the eyes of Beleg the Elf. Then with hatred long-stored Mm stepped up to Beleg, and drew forth the sword Anglachel that lay beneath the body of one that had fallen beside him; but Beleg stumbling up seized back the sword and thrust it at the Dwarf, and Mm in terror fled wailing",

Now Morgoth was filled with wrath against the Dwarves of Nogrod and Belegardh, because of the slaying of Glaurung, and he sent forth his servants to destroy them utterly. Therefore the Dwarves made war upon the Orcs, and drove them from Beleriand, and slew them in great numbers; and they took the treasure of Glaurung, and wrought it anew, and made therefrom the Nauglamír, the Necklace of the Dwarves. And they set therein the Silmaril which they had found in the hoard of Glaurung, and it shone amid the gold like a red star. Then the",

In the essay, Walker describes how she came upon Hurston’s novel Their Eyes Were Watching God while searching for a black heroine who might serve as a role model for young black women. She found no such heroine in Hurston’s novel, but she did find a woman who was “a good example of what a black woman should not be.” Walker’s essay, which appeared in the midst of the second wave of feminism, helped to revive interest in Hurston’s work. Her novel has been reprinted several times, and her other writings have begun to appear in print. But the revival of interest in Hurston has not yet led to a full appreciation of her work. Although she is often cited as one of the major figures of the Harlem Renaissance, she is rarely discussed in detail.

He was very much like other hobbits, and enjoyed a quiet life, eating second breakfasts every day, smoking his pipe, and drinking ale. One day, however, Gandalf the wizard came to visit, and told Bilbo that he was going to have an adventure. Bilbo did not want one, but Gandalf insisted, and soon Bilbo was off on a journey to the Lonely Mountain, where he met Gollum and discovered a magic ring. From there, Bilbo’s adventures took him all over Middle-earth, and he became a hero of legend. Bilbo Baggins was a hobbit who lived in his hole under the Hill at",

The fairies are not cruel; they are just different. And they are very particular about their rules. You must always say please and thank you, and mind your manners, and never ever laugh at them, because they don't like it.

It is an amusing fact, yet there is I fear some truth in it, that those who brew or bake, though few of them know the reason why, seldom or never have more than one hair on the top of their heads, whereas those who live mainly on green things or on meats have usually more hairs, sometimes a great deal more. This rule seems to be suspected, even by hobbits themselves, for in dress and fashion the two classes are always somewhat opposed. The hair question, however, is quite beyond the scope of my enquiries today.

Viv watched as Meg and Wyatt settled into two straight-back molded plastic seats. It was as if time had stood still here in this small town. The so-called hospital was more like a health clinic straight out of the twentieth century. The reception room was about two hundred square feet, with speckled brown and white linoleum tiles, egg-colored walls half covered with battered oak wainscoting having seen better days decades ago. There was a large bay window in serious need of a good scrubbing, but it at least allowed the morning sun in to brighten the all but otherwise unremarkable room. The adjacent wall donned two faded framed posters, matching alpine scenes, a group of colorfully clad skiers traversing steep, powdered slopes. Both posters seemed to be identical to one another, which Viv found to be a strange decorating choice. The glass overhead dome light put out little illumination, probably because of the inside layer of long-deceased insect parts. In one corner of the room was a water cooler surrounded by flowered Dixie cups. A low Crayola-strewn table held several dogeared coloring books, several Tonka toy trucks, and a lone stuffed rabbit, sans one ear. Staring at nothing in particular, she blinked, then blinked again.

Viv watched as Meg and Wyatt settled into two straight-back molded plastic seats. It was as if time had stood still here in this small town. The so-called hospital was more like a health clinic straight out of the twentieth century. The reception room was about two hundred square feet, with speckled brown and white linoleum tiles, egg-colored walls half covered with battered oak wainscoting having seen better days decades ago. There was a large bay window in serious need of a good scrubbing, but it at least allowed the morning sun in to brighten the all but otherwise unremarkable room. The adjacent wall donned two faded framed posters, matching alpine scenes, a group of colorfully clad skiers traversing steep, powdered slopes. Both posters seemed to be identical to one another, which Viv found to be a strange decorating choice. The glass overhead dome light put out little illumination, probably because of the inside layer of long-deceased insect parts. In one corner of the room was a water cooler surrounded by flowered Dixie cups. A low Crayola-strewn table held several dogeared coloring books, several Tonka toy trucks, and a lone stuffed rabbit, sans one ear. Staring at nothing in particular, she blinked, then blinked again. This wasn’t the first time she’d caught herself. She briefly wondered if it was possible to actually die of boredom. Was there a medical term for that? She moved back behind the reception desk, passed by the closed door of patient room 1. Although muffled, she could hear Grif’s country drawl, the easy, friendly cadence of his voice. Everyone loved Grif. She checked patient room #2—there were only two patient rooms within this facility—making sure everything was ready before she was to escort in one more catastrophic medical emergency: impacted earwax, a sprained ankle, or maybe an\n\n\nComplete the prefix:\nbecame Mrs. Bungo Baggins.

The name stuck though, and people called it Bag End even after the Baggins family had become quite forgotten; and indeed Hobbits remained ignorant of its old name until our own times in the Shire, when Tolman Cotton of Long Cleeve rediscovered a map of the district made in S.R. 1400 showing it as âUndershaftâ. That is the true origin of its present name. Undershaft was the name of the lane leading up to it from the Water; but it was soon corrupted to",

The door opened on to a tube-shaped hall like a tunnel: a very comfortable tunnel without smoke, with panelled walls, and floors tiled and carpeted, provided with polished chairs, and lots and lots of pegs for hats and coats—the hobbit was fond of visitors.

As the car drove away he turned round and walked unsteadily back towards the house. He had never felt so lonely, nor so wretched. His aunt and uncle meant well, but they were stupid and cruel, and everything they did annoyed him! They were only interested in one thing - money and status - and the fact that he couldn't give them either of these things made no difference whatever. Harry knew - because Uncle Vernon had shouted it often enough - that it would have been better off dead than as a burden on the Dursleys. How right he was. Harry sat down on the front step, bent his head over his knees, and began to cry slowly. He had never been so unhappy.

Mrs Dursley was a squinty woman with blonde hair turning grey, Mrs Potter had long black hair so shiny and straight it looked polished. Mrs Dursley liked cats, Mrs Potter dogs. The list of differences was endless, yet Mrs Dursley always spoke of her sister as though she were an embarrassing friend who had done something unfortunate. \"Mrs Potter is the sort of person who just drives past children who are carrying heavy luggage on the motorway,\" she would say. \"She never understands why no one speaks to her!\" Mrs Dursley would watch her sister's every move, ready to pounce on anything strange or unfeminine.

He kept remembering the way Hagrid had looked when he talked about them. . . . “And another thing,” said Uncle Vernon, “no more letters to that man, either.” “What man?” said Harry quickly. “That man you’ve been writing to all summer — Grunnmalf, wasn’t it? Grawnpiper? Something like that, anyway.” “Graffalorp,” said Harry. “Professor Graffalorp.” “Well, whatever. No more letters to him, see?

The documentaries you’ve made help convince me that your heart is in the right place, but why you? Why this? Why you for this?” “It seems the company is taking a new direction.” I shrug, choosing transparency: “We’re small. There are only a few of us. That’s probably why me.” “Have you read anything I’ve written, or did you ask me because your ex-wife had some of my books on her shelf?” “I’m finishing Base Paired right now. It’s funny, sexy, creative, and…” I trail off, searching for the word that eludes me. I began reading per Nat’s instructions, looking for what it is about romance she loves so much, trying to find that kernel that has built such a huge following for Fizzy. If I can understand it, I think, I’ll be able to unlock what we need to make this show a success. “And?” Fizzy prompts sardonically, like she’s expecting an insult to wrap up my list. “Joyful.” It comes out in a burst. “There’s a lot of joy in your writing.” I can see I’ve hit something important. She leans forward, happier now. “Yes. Now we’re getting somewhere. Romance is joyful. What brings you joy?” “My daughter. My work, historically speaking.” I dig around for something that makes me sound more dimensional, but sitting here with this bestselling author talking about joy and connection makes my life feel like a lather, rinse, repeat of arid routine. “Watching footie.

Dumbledore’s letter, written on owl-skin paper with a golden-quill pen, had said simply: \"Dear Mr Potter, We shall be leaving for Hogwarts’ School of Witchcraft and Wizardry on September 1st. Please come and collect you from number four, Privet Drive, at eleven o’clock. Yours sincerely, Albus Dumbledore.\" Harry had never seen a real wizarding letter before. They looked just like ordinary ones, except that the address was in green ink, not black.

It was also the biggest margin of victory ever recorded in a World Cup semifinal. But what made the result even more stunning was that Germany did it without its star striker, Thomas Mueller, who was suspended after picking up his second yellow card in the quarterfinal win over France. Instead, Mario Goetze scored both goals in the first half as Germany took control of the game. Then, in the second half, Miroslav Klose added three more goals to become the all-time leading scorer in World Cup history. He now has fifteen goals in four World Cups, surpassing Ronaldo's record of fourteen. \"I'm very happy,\" said Klose. \"This is an incredible moment.\" Germany will face Argentina in Sunday's final in Rio de Janeiro. The Germans have won the World Cup twice before, in 1954 and 1974",

Germany had lost only once in its previous 25 games, and had won 15 straight. But Brazil, which had been favored to win the title, was simply overwhelmed by the Germans. The Brazilians were booed off the field after the game, and their fans left the stadium early. They were stunned by the result. \"I'm speechless,\" said Brazilian star Neymar. \"We're very sad.\" The loss ended Brazil's hopes of winning a record sixth World Cup title. The team had been considered the favorites to win the tournament, and many expected them to dominate the competition. Instead, they were humiliated by the Germans. The match was a disaster for Brazil. The team looked sluggish and disorganized, and they failed to create any real scoring chances. The German defense was impenetrable, and the Brazilian attack was",

For a moment, she couldn’t concentrate on anything but their fingers pressed together, but then he said, “And where are we going?” She shook off the strange feeling in her stomach and grinned at the man who looked far too nervous for someone who held so much power. All she held was his hand. “Somewhere without papers to scowl at. Come.” Only when they were outside did she realize how intimate the gesture of holding his hand really was. Locked together as they were, her skirts brushed his boots and she could smell the soap he used. Hardly appropriate , even if she had been his sister-in-law or close to it. She attempted to release him—he could hardly want that prolonged contact—but he held fast to her fingers and watched her with an intense look as they walked, as if he were desperate for whatever reprieve she could give him. How long had he been staring at those pages? It didn’t take him long before he realized where she was leading him, and he picked up the pace, practically pulling her along with him in his hurry to get to the place she was starting to suspect was his only sanctuary. Simon’s pond was just as it had been when he brought Lucy there the other day, only the sun hid behind a layer of gray clouds and left the place feeling somewhat melancholy—tainted by the weight he carried on his shoulders. When they reached the nearest shore, he plopped himself down in the grass, pulling Lucy with him, and didn’t even seem to notice how close together they sat.

But despite its problems, soccer remains the world's most popular sport. And while the U.S. may never become a soccer powerhouse, the game is growing in popularity here. In fact, the number of Americans playing soccer has doubled over the past decade, according to the National Federation of State High School Associations. And more than 20 million people watch Major League Soccer games each year. So why do some Americans love soccer so much? Here are five reasons: 1. It's easy to learn. Unlike many other sports, soccer doesn't require expensive equipment or specialized skills. You can play it anywhere, anytime, with just a ball and a pair of shoes. That makes it accessible to almost everyone, regardless of age, gender, or physical ability. 2. It's fun. Soccer is a",

Aunt Petunia put on her most innocent expression. \"Well, he might look after himself, but he'd never find his way home by himself, would he?\" \"No,\" said Uncle Vernon grimly, \"he wouldn't.

I thought he quit.” Bezi puts her hand on my shoulder, and I press the button to look at the next picture even though I’m scared to death of what I might see. The photo’s a blur. The hooded figures are hazy, and Felix is lying on his back on the platform in the exact same spot where we’d found the bloody spot someone had tried to wash away. There’s nothing after that.

The hall expanded and then disappeared beneath her. The air changed, grew sweeter, and Alice glided upward to a different realm altogether, one blanketed in a cream-and-gold hush. The bedroom floor. Alice had never felt carpets like this before entering Park Lane. They were so rich, so new. They seemed to suck at her feet. The doors were mirrored and looked as if they’d been glazed with syrup. She adored the bedroom floor. It made her teeth tingle, as if her mouth were filled with sugar. It was heavenly, the home of angels. She waited at the end of the passage, smoothing her apron, listening to the clocks. Straightened her cap. The household machinery tensed, every clock hand poised, straining, ready. “Wait for Madam in the passage,” the house-parlormaid had warned her. “Don’t go and knock. She hates that.” Until now, Miss de Vries had been an entirely remote figure . Nearby, certainly: really only a few feet away if Madam was in the bedroom and Alice was in the dressing room. But she was attended by other servants. Alice observed her, studied her daily movements. She didn’t talk to her at all. The Bond Street seamstresses managed all the fittings for Madam’s ball dress. Alice despised it. It was black, per instruction, suitable for mourning. But the sleeves were fussy, heavy, and the lace looked almost antique in its design.

Alice had never felt carpets like this before entering Park Lane. They were so rich, so new. They seemed to suck at her feet. The doors were mirrored and looked as if they’d been glazed with syrup. She adored the bedroom floor. It made her teeth tingle, as if her mouth were filled with sugar. It was heavenly, the home of angels. She waited at the end of the passage, smoothing her apron, listening to the clocks. Straightened her cap. The household machinery tensed, every clock hand poised, straining, ready. “Wait for Madam in the passage,” the house-parlormaid had warned her. “Don’t go and knock. She hates that.” Until now, Miss de Vries had been an entirely remote figure . Nearby, certainly: really only a few feet away if Madam was in the bedroom and Alice was in the dressing room. But she was attended by other servants. Alice observed her, studied her daily movements. She didn’t talk to her at all. The Bond Street seamstresses managed all the fittings for Madam’s ball dress.

It is my pleasure to say that J.K. Rowling has written a book about a young wizard, and his training at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Inside this volume of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone you will find many thrilling, magical, and educational stories. The tales told here will excite you, make you laugh, and may even make you cry. But be warned. You may have heard that reading Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone will turn you into a wizard. This is not true. However, it could happen. If it does, please remember that magic is dangerous. Never wave a wand at anything important unless you know what you're doing.

He was seconds from getting invited out for a beer with the bros. “I need to get my wife home before she catches a cold.” Natalie ran a knuckle down his happy trail and he almost swallowed his tongue. “The only thing I’m going to catch,” she whispered for his ears alone, “is this di—” “All right, you take care, man. Let’s have a beer sometime,” August blurted, pushing Natalie’s legs into the truck, his blood thickening like hot gravy. At this point, he didn’t even care who saw his boner, as long as he got the woman home in the next ten minutes. Rest in peace to his headboard. In a few long strides, he was around the front bumper, diving into the driver’s side and reversing through the maze of emergency vehicles. “Oh, you are going to get it, Natalie queen princess Cates.” She slid gracefully across the front row of his truck, pressing her mouth to his shoulder. Kissing, licking . . . and biting down in way that sent his balls up into his throat. “Fuck.” “Yes, please.” She gripped his cock through the wet material of his sweatpants and in one big, shuddering breath, he fogged up every single window of the truck. “And I don’t need you to take it easy on me.

There was a large cellar under the kitchen measured by feet and inches, reaching right down to the ground; and there was a smaller one beneath the drawing-room, reaching down only to six feet below the surface. This was full of roots; but deep down in it there was a door, and down this ledges had been cut, leading to empty wine-cellars far below. It was rather damp here, and the air was quite cool, but perfectly pleasant. Hobbits are not fond of open doors. Their houses when fully furnished usually consist of a mass of",

And this decision made me see that there was a different way I wrote when, even subconsciously, I was seeking male approval, male sexual approval: a more coy way, more reserved, more nervous about being perceived as angry or vulgar.

Bilbo agreed to go along as their burglar, and they set off on their journey. Along the way, they encountered many obstacles such as trolls, goblins, and wolves.

But the name was not original; it had been bestowed upon the area by the Indians who lived here before them. And the Indians called it Paradise because they believed that the Great Spirit dwelt among the trees and flowers and birds of this valley. So the name stuck, and it has remained ever since. In fact, it is still used today by many people who live in the vicinity. But no one knows exactly how old the name really is. Some say that it dates back to the time of the early settlers, while others claim that it goes all the way back to the days of the Indians themselves. Whatever the case may be, there can be no doubt that the name is appropriate. For this is truly a paradise—a place of great natural beauty and peace.

It bled so much that I couldn't walk, and I cried and cried. Then one of the fairies came out of her hole and put some magic ointment on my knee. It made me feel better at once, and I was able to get up and run away. I didn't see where the fairy went, but I heard her laughing softly as she disappeared.

The documentaries you’ve made help convince me that your heart is in the right place, but why you? Why this? Why you for this?” “It seems the company is taking a new direction.” I shrug, choosing transparency: “We’re small. There are only a few of us. That’s probably why me.” “Have you read anything I’ve written, or did you ask me because your ex-wife had some of my books on her shelf?” “I’m finishing Base Paired right now. It’s funny, sexy, creative, and…” I trail off, searching for the word that eludes me. I began reading per Nat’s instructions, looking for what it is about romance she loves so much, trying to find that kernel that has built such a huge following for Fizzy. If I can understand it, I think, I’ll be able to unlock what we need to make this show a success. “And?” Fizzy prompts sardonically, like she’s expecting an insult to wrap up my list. “Joyful.” It comes out in a burst. “There’s a lot of joy in your writing.” I can see I’ve hit something important. She leans forward, happier now. “Yes. Now we’re getting somewhere. Romance is joyful. What brings you joy?” “My daughter. My work, historically speaking.” I dig around for something that makes me sound more dimensional, but sitting here with this bestselling author talking about joy and connection makes my life feel like a lather, rinse, repeat of arid routine. “Watching footie.

Even the way he held himself changed, rigid tension softening into lazy lines as he settled into his still-backward chair. “That’s in one of the second-floor guest rooms.” “This will do.” Dani wagged the bottle in the air, a slight frown drawing a line between her brows when she looked at Lore. “Are you all right, Lore? You look pale.” “Just my stomach,” she said, picking up her now-cold tea and taking a long sip. “I’ll have some of that sent to your rooms,” Brigitte said, nodding to the teacup as she wrapped the cork of the wine bottle in her skirt and tugged. It came off with a pop, and Alie offered quiet applause. Brigitte bowed and poured the wine into the now-empty cups. “It’s the only way I get through the cramps.” “Thank you,” Lore murmured. Lying to Brigitte felt rotten. Repaying kindness with dishonesty always did. Bastian stood so the four women could have the chairs—“I will lean fetchingly against the wall instead, and if any of you feel the sudden inspiration to paint me, I won’t even charge a modeling fee”—while Alie and the others sipped their wine and idly gossiped. Lore sipped her wine and thought about how in the myriad hells she was going to find where August, Anton, and now Bellegarde were hiding seventy-five-plus bodies. “I’m hoping to see Luc again next week,” Danielle said. Her eyes darted from her teacup to Lore. “He’s on a business\n\n\nComplete the prefix:\nIn a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends",

Then suddenly Gandalf turned and took hold of Bilbo's arm. â€œCome!â€ he said. â€œWe must hurry.â€ And they hurried on till they came to the top of the bank, and there they stopped again.

Fairel waited, features open and innocently curious. I hadn’t spoken about my mother with anyone but Soraya. Whereas my grandparents had flinched at the mention of Niphran, my attendant had taken me to see my mother in Bakir Tower once a week. I believed she feared I would one day start to think of my mother the way the rest of our kingdom did. The Mad Heir of Jasad. The Wailing Widow. A tragedy to be tossed in a tower and forgotten. “My mother told me hundreds of people came to cross the bridge shortly after the entombment, thinking they could whisper their wants and secrets to the sleeping Awaleen. The bridge is so long, it took weeks before anyone realized none of them finished the crossing.” Their bodies simply vanished, devoured by the mist shrouding Sirauk. Fairel shuddered. “How terrible. Then why do we celebrate the Awaleen with the Alcalah?” Because it is the nature of humanity to celebrate the things that want to kill them. We resumed our walk. I guided us off the main road, onto the street hosting Daron’s tavern and the visitors’ tents. I would never bring Fairel down this road under normal circumstances, but the Nizahl patrol would be eager to prove themselves to their Commander, and there was no glory in harassing drunkards leaving the tavern. “The tournament is a remembrance.

Fairel waited, features open and innocently curious. I hadn’t spoken about my mother with anyone but Soraya. Whereas my grandparents had flinched at the mention of Niphran, my attendant had taken me to see my mother in Bakir Tower once a week. I believed she feared I would one day start to think of my mother the way the rest of our kingdom did. The Mad Heir of Jasad. The Wailing Widow. A tragedy to be tossed in a tower and forgotten. “My mother told me hundreds of people came to cross the bridge shortly after the entombment, thinking they could whisper their wants and secrets to the sleeping Awaleen. The bridge is so long, it took weeks before anyone realized none of them finished the crossing.” Their bodies simply vanished, devoured by the mist shrouding Sirauk. Fairel shuddered. “How terrible. Then why do we celebrate the Awaleen with the Alcalah?” Because it is the nature of humanity to celebrate the things that want to kill them. We resumed our walk. I guided us off the main road, onto the street hosting Daron’s tavern and the visitors’ tents. I would never bring Fairel down this road under normal circumstances, but the Nizahl patrol would be eager to prove themselves to their Commander, and there was no glory in harassing drunkards leaving the tavern. “The tournament is a remembrance.

Maybe that’s why, even now , whenever she laughs, I do too. We’re still giggling when someone knocks on my door. I wait a second for Mum to breeze in without permission, plonk herself on the bed, and steal my phone to scroll through TikTok. When that doesn’t happen, I frown in confusion and Giselle grins in response. “Oh yeah. Forgot to mention: Bradley’s here.” “What?” It’s supposed to come out frosty and disgusted, but I accidentally squawk like a bird. Giselle snickers and taps my forehead again. “Deep breaths, Cel.” Then she gets up and saunters to the door. I don’t quite believe her until it swings open and, yep, Bradley’s standing right there. I haven’t seen him framed by my doorway in…years. He looks different but the same: taller and older, sure, but wide-eyed and nervous like he used to be.

I sucked in air, but it was just empty space, no oxygen. The news story had been getting to me, too, clawing at the edges of my dreams. The way no one would listen to her testimony. The way they mocked her victim impact statement. The way they read her diary aloud. Somewhere down here lay the rock I’d once thrown. Somewhere down here was the hula hoop circle we’d observed, a quarter century of changes within its circumference.

The slow melting of any certainty I’d had about Thalia’s death, a melting I’d been terrified to acknowledge but could no longer ignore.

Their numbers are small and shrinking, which is why Harry Potter's birth was cause for celebration. You see, Harry is a wizard (of course) and an orphan, and his parents' deaths at some point in the recent past have created something of a vacancy in the magical community. \n\nHarry's aunt and uncle, Petunia and Vernon Dursley, are Muggles, which means they're completely ignorant of magic and its practitioners. They've raised Harry since he was a baby, and they've done their best to make him forget who he really is. But now, at age eleven, Harry has begun receiving letters addressed to him at Privet Drive.

It was not any one thing stealing my breath; it was everything at once. The sudden atomization of Yahav and Jerome and Lance. Maybe the podcast, too, gone in a puff of smoke. The slow melting of any certainty I’d had about Thalia’s death, a melting I’d been terrified to acknowledge but could no longer ignore. The realization that you, one of the best things about Granby, might have been not only a fraud, not only a predator, but—it was possible, I was finally letting it creep into view—a more violent kind of monster. I sucked in air, but it was just empty space, no oxygen. The news story had been getting to me, too, clawing at the edges of my dreams. The way no one would listen to her testimony. The way they mocked her victim impact statement. The way they read her diary aloud. Somewhere down here lay the rock I’d once thrown. Somewhere down here was the hula hoop circle we’d observed, a quarter century of changes within its circumference. It was in the other woods, the ones at the bottom of campus—connected to these but drier, flatter, denser—that we’d built the Kurt shrine. Those were the same woods where Barbara Crocker’s body was found in 1975, just outside the Granby property line.

You see, Harry is a wizard (of course) and an orphan, and his parents' deaths at some point in the recent past have created something of a vacancy in the magical community. \n\nHarry's aunt and uncle, Petunia and Vernon Dursley, are Muggles, which means they're completely ignorant of magic and its practitioners. They've raised Harry since he was a baby, and they've done their best to make him forget who he really is. But now, at age eleven, Harry has begun receiving letters addressed to him at Privet Drive.
