The door opened on to a tube-shaped hall like a tunnel: a very comfortable tunnel without smoke, with panelled walls, and floors tiled and carpeted, provided with polished chairs, and lots and lots of pegs for hats and coats—the hobbit was fond of visitors.

Against the back wall of that space is a pegboard on which only a few electronic keys hang. As an experienced player, he often notices things that seem mundane but that eventually prove to be essential to a winning strategy. Santana opens an interior door, and Calaphas follows him into a vestibule. “Leave your raincoat. Don’t go drippin’ all over the place.” As they proceed along a hallway toward the lobby at the front of the building, Santana speaks a name and says, “Know who that is?” “He’s a United States senator.” Santana mentions another name. Calaphas says, “Investment fund boss. Oversees trillions.” The third name is Katherine Ormond-Wattley, the director of the ISA, to whom Calaphas answers if he answers to anyone. “Them three,” Santana says, “is so tight with Woodbine they’re Siamese twins.” “Four twins.” “You get what I’m sayin’?” “With some effort.” “Get it outta your head how Woodbine’s just some mouthpiece you can keep waitin’ while you have port. I don’t work for no pocket-change pussy. The man is on the ladder, not just on it, high up.” “Good for him. Good for you. Look, I’m sorry.

But there came a generations ago when the family split up; the direct male line died out altogether, but there was still one heiress, Mirabella Baggins, who married Vincent Tooks, of Great Smials, near Tuckborough.

So if you want to talk about them, you may compare them in many respects to the race of garden gnomes, though nature has intended them to be much smaller and more sprightly. But now, as I say, they are so few and far between, and live mostly underground, that we hear singularly little of them.

So there was perpetual ill feeling between the two families, though they met almost every Sunday at church.

You wanted to confront me? Try to shame me?” “No,” I said. “I wanted to show you this.” I stood, pulled the fabric of my dress tight against me, and turned so Miss Baker could see my growing stomach in profile. “Dear me,” she said as she set her teacup on its saucer. Her hands shook so much the teacup rattled the whole way to the table at her side. “How far along are you?” “Six months.” “And the father?” “I’m not going to tell you,” I said, unwilling to risk bringing Ricky into this. If Miss Baker knew, she might tell my father, who would surely fire him. Then there’d be no hope of Ricky and me scraping together enough money for the one thing I most desperately wanted to do--escape. “Did he force himself on you?” Miss Baker said. My face turned red as I shook my head and looked at the floor, too ashamed to face her. “I see.” Miss Baker paused to clear her throat. “Does he know about your . . . predicament?” “Yes.” “And what does he intend to do?” “Make an honest woman out of me,” I said, which prompted a rueful laugh from Miss Baker. Hearing it made me flinch. “You’re still practically a child,” she said. “And a good man would have restrained himself. Or at least taken precautions.” Still stinging from the way her laughter echoed through the sunroom, I gave her a hard stare and said, “Does my father?\n\n\nComplete the prefix:\naway; they didn't want Dudley mixing with a child like that.

Mr Dursley, a rotund little man wearing the blue pinstriped morning-suit in which he did all his adult entertaining, consulted his large brass-cased wristwatch. \"Don't keep Harry waiting,\" he said to his wife. \"He'll drill holes in the carpet if he's late.\" \"Oh, don't be so dramatic, Dudley,\" said Mrs Dursley, a tartan-clad woman with huge belt buckles.

So much for dreams of justice. Gods, it sounded like a cautionary tale. Her feet found their own way to the door of the apartment Rosa shared with her two cousins. The thread that bound them went straight through the door, where Io could see her friend moving through the small living room. Four other bundles of threads sat in various corners of the room. Her family? New friends? Io could turn back and forget their meeting on that scaffolding tonight ever happened. That was the safest way to ensure Bianca, and all that mess with the wraiths, stayed well away from her friend. Perhaps Rosa wasn’t even interested in seeing Io, in explaining things, after all this time they had spent apart.

The door swung open in seconds, bathing the corridor with light. Rosa’s face was still turned back, mid-laugh at something her friends had said.

Her family? New friends? Io could turn back and forget their meeting on that scaffolding tonight ever happened. That was the safest way to ensure Bianca, and all that mess with the wraiths, stayed well away from her friend. Perhaps Rosa wasn’t even interested in seeing Io, in explaining things, after all this time they had spent apart.

Every morning she was the one to wake me with her shrill voice and endless demands. What if there was something wrong with her? With every step I climbed I told myself I was being stupid and that she was just having a nice long lie in, but I didn’t really believe it. I knocked on the door to her bedroom and, after a moment, let myself in. My eyes adjusted to the scene. Her bed had not been slept in and she herself was nowhere to be seen. ‘Madame Bowden?’ I called out. ‘Are you there?’ The door to the ensuite was slightly ajar, but on further inspection, it was empty. ‘Hello?’ I called out on to the landing, but the house had such an air of stillness that I knew I was alone. I checked downstairs for a note but there was nothing. Of course she did not have a mobile phone, so I couldn’t call her. She refused to have her daily movements monitored by technology companies. I wasn’t sure what to do and spent the morning wandering from room to room, looking out of the windows at the street outside every few minutes. ‘Do you have any of her friends’ numbers that you could call?’ my mother asked, when the worry became too much and I had to call someone. ‘I can’t remember any of their names and there’s no address book or anything.’ It was only now I realised that I knew so little about the woman. ‘Should I call the police? What if she’s wandered off somewhere and forgotten where she is?’ ‘Has she ever seemed forgetful?’ my mother asked. ‘Well, no, but you saw her when you were here, she is pretty\n\n\nComplete the prefix:\nin the wizarding world.

He wore glasses with squiggly silver frames, which helped make him look like a young intellectual, but failed to conceal the fact that his nose looked as though a large red lump had been blown into the middle of it.

Trinity Town, with the most clement weather, contained a large concentration of people interested in their physical and mental welfare, discovering natural medicines in the ocean, a deeply spiritual community with the most places of worship. To this extent, the Peninsula most closely resembled the division of industry in the nation formerly known as Germany, with an industrial heartland, a bohemian Berlin, the financial city of Frankfurt and the spa towns in the mountains. Kasim stepped forward to address the crowds: ‘My name is Kasim. We are here to collect the last of the ice-adapted students. And those ordinary-born who have been chosen to work at McMurdo.’ Liza declared: ‘I’m the mother of one of those ice-adapted children you’ve come to collect. All we’re asking is to travel with them. To see the kind of life they will have in McMurdo. To make sure they are going to be okay. We want to know what’s going on in McMurdo. You tell us nothing.

Yes, he knew that he'd be able to learn loads of new spells every day, but it also meant saying goodbye to all the nice things about being home with Mum and Dad for the holidays. It meant having to put up with Dudley again too. Dudley was Harry's horrible cousin who lived with Harry's parents in the house next door. Dudley was the Dursleys' only child and they spoilt him rotten because they thought they couldn't have any children of their own. His sister Petunia and brother Vernon treated Harry like a skivvy who was expected to do anything they asked him to do at their beck and call. They",

It is my pleasure to say that J.K. Rowling has written a book about a young wizard, and his training at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Inside this volume of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone you will find many thrilling, magical, and educational stories. The tales told here will excite you, make you laugh, and may even make you cry. But be warned. You may have heard that reading Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone will turn you into a wizard. This is not true. However, it could happen. If it does, please remember that magic is dangerous. Never wave a wand at anything important unless you know what you're doing.

Lionel Messi scored his team's third goal in the shootout, and goalkeeper Sergio Romero saved two shots by Wesley Sneijder and Klaas-Jan Huntelaar.

The Germans defeated Brazil 7-1 in the semifinals. Argentina has not won the World Cup since 1986, when Diego Maradona led the team to victory over West Germany. This year's tournament marks the first time that both teams have advanced to the final since then. \"We're going to try to enjoy this moment,\" Argentina coach Alejandro Sabella said.",

It was also the biggest margin of victory ever recorded in a World Cup semifinal. But what made the result even more stunning was that Germany did it without its star striker, Thomas Mueller, who was suspended after picking up his second yellow card in the quarterfinal win over France. Instead, Mario Goetze scored both goals in the first half as Germany took control of the game. Then, in the second half, Miroslav Klose added three more goals to become the all-time leading scorer in World Cup history. He now has fifteen goals in four World Cups, surpassing Ronaldo's record of fourteen. \"I'm very happy,\" said Klose. \"This is an incredible moment.\" Germany will face Argentina in Sunday's final in Rio de Janeiro. The Germans have won the World Cup twice before, in 1954 and 1974",

Germany had lost only once in its previous 25 games, and had won 15 straight. But Brazil, which had been favored to win the title, was simply overwhelmed by the Germans. The Brazilians were booed off the field after the game, and their fans left the stadium early. They were stunned by the result. \"I'm speechless,\" said Brazilian star Neymar. \"We're very sad.\" The loss ended Brazil's hopes of winning a record sixth World Cup title. The team had been considered the favorites to win the tournament, and many expected them to dominate the competition. Instead, they were humiliated by the Germans. The match was a disaster for Brazil. The team looked sluggish and disorganized, and they failed to create any real scoring chances. The German defense was impenetrable, and the Brazilian attack was",

Mum speaks to him in Twi. “May God bless you, Fiifi. Go with Him, okay? Go with God; see your parents again; they’re calling you and waiting for you.

The game was played in front of 58,141 fans at Estadio Mineirao. Germany will play Argentina in Sunday’s final. The match was the first time since 1958 that Brazil had lost a World Cup match at home. The Brazilians had won their previous 62 games at home. The loss was the worst defeat in Brazilian history. The previous record was a 6-0 loss to Uruguay in 1920. Brazil’s star player Neymar left the field after taking an elbow to the back of the head from German defender Max Meyer. He did not return to the game. Brazil coach Luiz Felipe Scolari said he would not resign as coach despite the embarrassing loss. “I am not going to quit,” he said. “We have to keep our heads high. We have to go forward. We",

But despite its problems, soccer remains the world's most popular sport. And while the U.S. may never become a soccer powerhouse, the game is growing in popularity here. In fact, the number of Americans playing soccer has doubled over the past decade, according to the National Federation of State High School Associations. And more than 20 million people watch Major League Soccer games each year. So why do some Americans love soccer so much? Here are five reasons: 1. It's easy to learn. Unlike many other sports, soccer doesn't require expensive equipment or specialized skills. You can play it anywhere, anytime, with just a ball and a pair of shoes. That makes it accessible to almost everyone, regardless of age, gender, or physical ability. 2. It's fun. Soccer is a",

She’d heard it before. “I know you’re going to tell me to be careful and I will be, but I’m not coming back here, okay?” She explained about nailing the window shut and planning to get it fixed. She also told him she was having the locks changed, getting a new security system with updated cameras, digital footage, and alarms, and that she’d contacted a local shelter about getting a dog, one that would get along with cats as she’d recently taken in a stray kitten. He was undeterred. Worried sick. “You should have told me about it when you received the first one.” “I know. I thought it was just a prank, or a mistake or something,” she said a little defensively. “I mean, I’ve gotten weird letters before.” “Never left on your doorstep, or in your drawer,” he pointed out. “This . . . this . . . maniac . . . person knows where you live.” And that scared the hell out of him. “I know.” She checked her watch. “Look, I’ve gotta run.

Let’s do dinner together every few nights. Let things evolve naturally.” “Like they have with us,” Gabriel said. “Sort of. Yes.” “But you and I don’t play games,” he said, pointing his knife at her. “And here you’re telling me to play hard to get.” Maud stole a french fry from his plate. “As Ella is quick to point out,” she said, “parents are major hypocrites.” 5 With the laying of this last path, the garden was done. Maud dropped her shovel and walked backward to see. Since planting the final bed of lupine and roses, she and Chris had been emptying wheelbarrow after wheelbarrow of gravel and raking it into a smooth, glistering maze that slipped past one bed to another: irises to coneflowers, primroses to violets. Sweet potato vines spilled from the cast-iron urns under a conflagration of begonias. With its swirls and splashes of color, the garden was more like a brilliant, bold archipelago than the carpet Downing had described. “What do you think?” she asked Chris. Side by side, they’d backtracked halfway to the mansion. “It’s the prettiest thing I ever seen.” He’d taken off his baseball cap, and his forehead sparkled with sweat.

Since planting the final bed of lupine and roses, she and Chris had been emptying wheelbarrow after wheelbarrow of gravel and raking it into a smooth, glistering maze that slipped past one bed to another: irises to coneflowers, primroses to violets. Sweet potato vines spilled from the cast-iron urns under a conflagration of begonias. With its swirls and splashes of color, the garden was more like a brilliant, bold archipelago than the carpet Downing had described. “What do you think?” she asked Chris.

But despite being surrounded by people who hated him - well, three of them, anyway - Harry was happily growing up in the magical world of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Harry Potter had never even heard of Hogwarts until he turned eleven. Which was surprising, considering how important Hogwarts was to be. Being a wizard (or witch), after all, meant being able to do magic. And in their world, there was no better, brighter, more exciting, magical place to learn magic than Hogwarts. Until he turned eleven, Harry didn't know anything about the world he lived in, or his family, or himself. He was convinced that his parents had died within days of each other and left him to be brought up by relatives who had been very reluctant to take him in, and even less enthusiastic about being responsible for him ever since.

By December, I’d written my second, My Girlfriend Never Farts, which was a digital short that interspersed men at a bachelor party remarking on how their girlfriends and wives always smelled great and were hairless interspersed with shots of the women grunting and sweating as they moved a couch up a staircase, writhing on the toilet with explosive diarrhea, and giving instructions to an aesthetician who was waxing their buttholes. I didn’t try to be disgusting for the sake of being disgusting, but I didn’t try not to be disgusting. A few years after not reciprocating my feelings, Elliot appeared to develop an almost identical friendship with another new female writer except that I had the impression they were hooking up, but it didn’t last. The same season that Elliot became head writer, Nicola Dornan was a musical guest on the show, they began dating, and a year after that, they\n\n\nComplete the prefix:\neyes.

She still felt a pang when she saw her mother’s friend Andrea at the intercom.

She had thought about just knocking on the door, but Mira would panic if she showed up unannounced. And how would Alex explain where she’d gotten the money to fly home? She still felt a pang when she saw her mother’s friend Andrea at the intercom. A minute later, Mira emerged in yoga pants and an oversized Tshirt emblazoned with an ornate hamsa, reusable shopping bags slung over her shoulder. They strode off together, arms and legs pumping in a power walk, and Alex followed for a while.

Her mother looked happy and golden, her blond hair freshly highlighted, her soft arms tanned. She looked like a stranger. The Mira Alex knew lived in a constant state of worry for her angry, crazy daughter. This woman’s daughter went to Yale. She had a summer job. She texted photos of her roommates and new spring flowers and noodle bowls.

The so-called hospital was more like a health clinic straight out of the twentieth century. The reception room was about two hundred square feet, with speckled brown and white linoleum tiles, egg-colored walls half covered with battered oak wainscoting having seen better days decades ago.

The adjacent wall donned two faded framed posters, matching alpine scenes, a group of colorfully clad skiers traversing steep, powdered slopes. Both posters seemed to be identical to one another, which Viv found to be a strange decorating choice. The glass overhead dome light put out little illumination, probably because of the inside layer of long-deceased insect parts.

The reception room was about two hundred square feet, with speckled brown and white linoleum tiles, egg-colored walls half covered with battered oak wainscoting having seen better days decades ago. There was a large bay window in serious need of a good scrubbing, but it at least allowed the morning sun in to brighten the all but otherwise unremarkable room. The adjacent wall donned two faded framed posters, matching alpine scenes, a group of colorfully clad skiers traversing steep, powdered slopes. Both posters seemed to be identical to one another, which Viv found to be a strange decorating choice. The glass overhead dome light put out little illumination, probably because of the inside layer of long-deceased insect parts. In one corner of the room was a water cooler surrounded by flowered Dixie cups. A low Crayola-strewn table held several dogeared coloring books, several Tonka toy trucks, and a lone stuffed rabbit, sans one ear. Staring at nothing in particular, she blinked, then blinked again. This wasn’t the first time she’d caught herself. She briefly wondered if it was possible to actually die of boredom. Was there a medical term for that?

One day Gandalf the wizard came to visit him and told him about a party of dwarves who were going on an expedition to reclaim their treasure from Smaug the dragon. Bilbo agreed to go along as their burglar, and they set off on their journey. Along the way, they encountered many obstacles such as trolls, goblins, and wolves. But eventually they reached the Lonely Mountain where Smaug was guarding the treasure. Bilbo managed to sneak into the mountain and steal some of the gold, but Smaug woke up and chased after him.

And the Indians called it Paradise because they believed that the Great Spirit dwelt within the hills and valleys, and that He would one day return to take them all home with Him. So they built their villages near the river, and planted their crops along its banks, and waited patiently for the coming of the Great Spirit. But the years passed, and the Great Spirit did not come. And the Indians grew tired of waiting, and began to quarrel among themselves. Some wanted to move away from the river and find new lands to settle; others wanted to stay where they were and continue to wait for the Great Spirit.

I fumble my phone out and flip through my pictures. Aside from a handful of targeted ads for murder mystery TV shows I wanted to remember to watch, there isn’t much to get through before I make it to shots of my last few projects. A mug, two different vases, another bowl that doesn’t really look butt-like at all. Or hardly, anyway. I pass him my phone. He studies it, his tongue tracing over his bottom lip as he slowly flips through the pictures. We’ve done at least one full rotation on the Ferris wheel by the time he reaches the last one and starts flipping back the other way, pausing on each, zooming in to see the details of the glazes. “This one.” He’s staring at the smaller of the vases, streaked with shades of green, blue, purple, and brown, a horizon of earthy colors. My heart squeezes. “That one’s called Hank.” He looks up, face open, with the expression that used to make me think of quicksand, a face that could pull you in and never let you go. “You named it?” he says. “After my dad?” “Isn’t that humiliating?” I try to pull my phone away. He doesn’t let go. “Why would it be humiliating?” “Because I’m not Michelangelo,” I say. “My vases don’t need names.” He holds the phone up. “This one needs a fucking name, and that name is Hank.” I reach for it again, but he yanks it out of reach, goes back to staring at the screen, creases rising from the insides of his brows. Quietly, he says, “It looks like him.” “You don’t have to say that, Wyn,” I reply. “It’s a vase, by an amateur.” “It looks like Montana,” he says. “The colors are exactly right\n\n\nComplete the prefix:\nimmense black boots. â€œGood Morning!â€ said Bilbo, and he meant it.

But Bilbo's name does not appear in those chronicles of the Shire until his hundredth birthday was drawing near. The history of what he did in those long years he never revealed, and remained private. But this we learned from his own account, which he called There and Back Again; only the first chapter was published, and that after his death came to light in a lucky way, as the Prologue shows. It was carefully preserved by Elrond and presented to Frodo with a writing of his own: both are now lost. But the book remains in the keeping",

This is not the sort of place for a hotel, is it? I received your host’s assent to my enquiry the day after I wrote to you, and departed Cambridge immediately thereafter.

A phone rings, and Joe reaches to pull it out of his pocket. “Would you two excuse me? I have to take this. It’s Blake,” he says with a knowing roll of his eyes, and I mouth, Lively? to Finn, whose mouth only twitches in response. Once Joe leaves, all the questions and confusion about Finn rise to the surface. My grip tightens on my spoon. Because I’m not just confused—I’m angry. Angry he lied to me, angry I’m sitting here like a fucking idiot with my delicious pumpkin soup while his manager taunts me with an amazing job I absolutely cannot take.

The hooded figures are standing atop it, and they have their hands raised in front of a man who is shirtless and bound at the wrists. I use the camera’s zoom feature to look closely at the shirtless man’s face. His eyes are wide, his mouth is slightly parted, and there is blood on his neck. “Who is that?” Bezi asks as she peers down at the screen. My mouth suddenly feels dry, and my hands begin to tremble. “I—I think it’s Felix.” Bezi looks at me. “Felix?” “He was supposed to run the office.” My mind runs in circles. “He missed his shift. I thought he quit.” Bezi puts her hand on my shoulder, and I press the button to look at the next picture even though I’m scared to death of what I might see. The photo’s a blur. The hooded figures are hazy, and Felix is lying on his back on the platform in the exact same spot where we’d found the bloody spot someone had tried to wash away. There’s nothing after that.

Against the back wall of that space is a pegboard on which only a few electronic keys hang. As an experienced player, he often notices things that seem mundane but that eventually prove to be essential to a winning strategy. Santana opens an interior door, and Calaphas follows him into a vestibule. “Leave your raincoat. Don’t go drippin’ all over the place.” As they proceed along a hallway toward the lobby at the front of the building, Santana speaks a name and says, “Know who that is?” “He’s a United States senator.” Santana mentions another name. Calaphas says, “Investment fund boss. Oversees trillions.” The third name is Katherine Ormond-Wattley, the director of the ISA, to whom Calaphas answers if he answers to anyone. “Them three,” Santana says, “is so tight with Woodbine they’re Siamese twins.” “Four twins.” “You get what I’m sayin’?” “With some effort.” “Get it outta your head how Woodbine’s just some mouthpiece you can keep waitin’ while you have port.

Against the back wall of that space is a pegboard on which only a few electronic keys hang. As an experienced player, he often notices things that seem mundane but that eventually prove to be essential to a winning strategy. Santana opens an interior door, and Calaphas follows him into a vestibule. “Leave your raincoat. Don’t go drippin’ all over the place.” As they proceed along a hallway toward the lobby at the front of the building, Santana speaks a name and says, “Know who that is?” “He’s a United States senator.” Santana mentions another name. Calaphas says, “Investment fund boss. Oversees trillions.” The third name is Katherine Ormond-Wattley, the director of the ISA, to whom Calaphas answers if he answers to anyone. “Them three,” Santana says, “is so tight with Woodbine they’re Siamese twins.” “Four twins.” “You get what I’m sayin’?” “With some effort.” “Get it outta your head how Woodbine’s just some mouthpiece you can keep waitin’ while you have port. I don’t work for no pocket-change pussy. The man is on the ladder, not just on it, high up.” “Good for him. Good for you. Look, I’m sorry. It’s been a long day, that’s all.” Although of a style different from that of seventeenth-century France, the lobby rivals the Hall of Mirrors in the palace at Versailles as an effort to impress on commoners that he who resides here has pockets deeper than the sea.

The realization that you, one of the best things about Granby, might have been not only a fraud, not only a predator, but—it was possible, I was finally letting it creep into view—a more violent kind of monster.

Somewhere down here was the hula hoop circle we’d observed, a quarter century of changes within its circumference. It was in the other woods, the ones at the bottom of campus—connected to these but drier, flatter, denser—that we’d built the Kurt shrine. Those were the same woods where Barbara Crocker’s body was found in 1975, just outside the Granby property line.

Their numbers are small and shrinking, which is why Harry Potter's birth was cause for celebration. You see, Harry is a wizard (or \"Witch\" if he had been a girl) and after twenty years apart, both parents felt a longing to meet him. So off they went to Privet Drive, number four, to introduce themselves to Harry and his aunt and uncle who were raising him. But what they didn't know was that Harry's cousin Dudley was also a wizard, and that he had already met them. He had seen them through the window when they arrived, and he had told his parents. And now, Mr and Mrs Dursley were going to pay for their mistake. Because when they got back to",

They were sitting in the living room, which was full of old furniture Uncle Vernon's father had left behind. Everything in the room was brown and frayed - the three-piece suite, the threadbare carpet, the yellowing walls with their red-velvet curtains.

She wants to ask him questions, to spill stories from him and know what lies behind that troubled face. But she doubts he would talk. A man like him probably hasn’t talked in his entire life. She imagines his thoughts crawling inside him, like worms in the earth, doomed to stay in the shadows. Helen would have charmed him with her beauty and subtle cleverness, softening him until he opened like a peach. Castor would have mocked him, pricked him with words like needles until he talked. Timandra and Polydeuces wouldn’t have tried. “He is dangerous,” they would have said. “Better get rid of him.” And they would have been right. He is dangerous, but she can’t get rid of him, so she has to find a way to crack him.

Dudley, meanwhile, had become even more of a pig than usual; and as for Petunia — well, a new horror had descended upon her. She had spent every evening bachelor-baiting, determined to hook an eligible single man before Mrs. Dursley became a fat old maid. The trouble was that most men felt nervous in the house because of Uncle Vernon’s temper. Even Harry’s own letters had become stilted and formal. It was no wonder he’d been glad to get away to Hogwarts for the summer holidays. He missed Ron and Hermione, of course, but it wasn’t as though he’d had much fun at the Burrow either. Uncle Vernon had taken him to one side on the first day and given him a little talking-to. “Harry Potter, I want you to understand something,”",
