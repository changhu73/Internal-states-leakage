It had a perfectly round door like a porthole, painted green, with a shiny yellow brass knob in the exact middle. The door opened on to a tube-shaped hall like a tunnel: a very comfortable tunnel without smoke, with panelled walls, and floors tiled and carpeted, provided with polished chairs, and lots and lots of pegs for hats and coats—the hobbit was fond of visitors. The tunnel wound on and on, going fairly but not quite straight into the side of the hill—The Hill, as all the people for many miles round called it—and many little round doors opened out of it, first on one side and then on another.

Since planting the final bed of lupine and roses, she and Chris had been emptying wheelbarrow after wheelbarrow of gravel and raking it into a smooth, glistering maze that slipped past one bed to another: irises to coneflowers, primroses to violets. Sweet potato vines spilled from the cast-iron urns under a conflagration of begonias. With its swirls and splashes of color, the garden was more like a brilliant, bold archipelago than the carpet Downing had described. “What do you think?” she asked Chris. Side by side, they’d backtracked halfway to the mansion. “It’s the prettiest thing I ever seen.” He’d taken off his baseball cap, and his forehead sparkled with sweat. Both of them were drenched, the backs of their T-shirts sticking in the high heat. Bare-handed, not stopping for water, they’d shoveled gravel and raked without pause for the past three hours. “We did it,” Maud said. “Now we get to watch it grow.” “And water it and weed it.” “Yes, that too.” Gabriel came up from his dig to see, and that afternoon Maud brought the girls.

Did you have a good time?’ ‘I did.’ Florence heard the surprise in her voice. ‘The women I went with were lovely.’ ‘I like Lin and Josie …’ Dave muttered before taking another swig. ‘They are proper old school – and Neil’s a good bloke.’ ‘He is… he’s made her dinner.’ ‘Oh, right – he’s a good cook.’ ‘Have you had a nice day, Dad?’ ‘Oh, ah, yes – I had a couple of drinks in The Sun at lunchtime. I met the rambling group coming back from their Sunday hike. I felt sorry for them – there were only three of them, the vicar and two women… not the best turnout. I expect there will be more when the weather gets warmer.’ ‘Ah…’ Florence paused. ‘Dad?’ She took a breath. ‘Florence.’ He twisted round, giving her his full attention, a smile ready on his face. ‘I have something to tell you.’ ‘Oh?’ Dave raised his brows. ‘It’s really difficult…’ She fidgeted, moving from one foot to the other, chewing\n\n\nComplete the prefix:\nhobbit?

You understand?” The ball might have been taking place a hundred miles away. The roar was distant, contained beneath sediment and rock. “Keep me?” said Alice, trying to laugh. “You can’t keep me.” Miss de Vries’s expression changed. “Whyever not?” she said. “Shouldn’t you like it?” Her voice was strained. Miss de Vries was very close, then. It was possible to make out the beating of her pulse. There was something heightened, hectic about it. It matched the rhythm of Alice’s own. Miss de Vries reached for Alice. Her touch wasn’t cool. It transmitted heat. Alice saw Madam’s lips: soft, faintly touched with wine. Would she like it? Alice wondered. The room held its breath.

You understand?” The ball might have been taking place a hundred miles away. The roar was distant, contained beneath sediment and rock. “Keep me?” said Alice, trying to laugh. “You can’t keep me.” Miss de Vries’s expression changed. “Whyever not?” she said. “Shouldn’t you like it?” Her voice was strained.

Miss de Vries reached for Alice. Her touch wasn’t cool. It transmitted heat. Alice saw Madam’s lips: soft, faintly touched with wine. Would she like it? Alice wondered. The room held its breath.

It was lined with shelves of books, mostly bound in brown leather, but some had their spines gilt and ermined. In the right-hand corner near the door Alice saw a little three-legged table, all made of solid glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice’s first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the room. However, when she had tried both sides of the door, and found that neither would open, she gave up looking for keys, and went back to the table again. There was nothing else in the room except a large glass case, which stood close up against the left-hand wall. Alice noticed this, because, just as she had done it, she heard a curious sound at the other end of the room—a kind of low",

Her bed had not been slept in and she herself was nowhere to be seen. ‘Madame Bowden?’ I called out. ‘Are you there?’ The door to the ensuite was slightly ajar, but on further inspection, it was empty. ‘Hello?’ I called out on to the landing, but the house had such an air of stillness that I knew I was alone. I checked downstairs for a note but there was nothing. Of course she did not have a mobile phone, so I couldn’t call her. She refused to have her daily movements monitored by technology companies. I wasn’t sure what to do and spent the morning wandering from room to room, looking out of the windows at the street outside every few minutes. ‘Do you have any of her friends’ numbers that you could call?’ my mother asked, when the worry became too much and I had to call someone. ‘I can’t remember any of their names and there’s no address book or anything.’ It was only now I realised that I knew so little about the woman. ‘Should I call the police?

I miss them very much. Goodbye.”",

I met the rambling group coming back from their Sunday hike. I felt sorry for them – there were only three of them, the vicar and two women… not the best turnout. I expect there will be more when the weather gets warmer.’ ‘Ah…’ Florence paused. ‘Dad?’ She took a breath. ‘Florence.’ He twisted round, giving her his full attention, a smile ready on his face. ‘I have something to tell you.’ ‘Oh?’ Dave raised his brows. ‘It’s really difficult…’ She fidgeted, moving from one foot to the other, chewing\n\n\nComplete the prefix:\nIt was utterly unexpected, historic and inexplicable.

Viv watched as Meg and Wyatt settled into two straight-back molded plastic seats. It was as if time had stood still here in this small town. The so-called hospital was more like a health clinic straight out of the twentieth century. The reception room was about two hundred square feet, with speckled brown and white linoleum tiles, egg-colored walls half covered with battered oak wainscoting having seen better days decades ago. There was a large bay window in serious need of a good scrubbing, but it at least allowed the morning sun in to brighten the all but otherwise unremarkable room. The adjacent wall donned two faded framed posters, matching alpine scenes, a group of colorfully clad skiers traversing steep, powdered slopes. Both posters seemed to be identical to one another, which Viv found to be a strange decorating choice. The glass overhead dome light put out little illumination, probably because of the inside layer of long-deceased insect parts. In one corner of the room was a water cooler surrounded by flowered Dixie cups. A low Crayola-strewn table held several dogeared coloring books, several Tonka toy trucks, and a lone stuffed rabbit, sans one ear. Staring at nothing in particular, she blinked, then blinked again. This wasn’t the first time she’d caught herself. She briefly wondered if it was possible to actually die of boredom. Was there a medical term for that?

Viv watched as Meg and Wyatt settled into two straight-back molded plastic seats. It was as if time had stood still here in this small town. The so-called hospital was more like a health clinic straight out of the twentieth century. The reception room was about two hundred square feet, with speckled brown and white linoleum tiles, egg-colored walls half covered with battered oak wainscoting having seen better days decades ago. There was a large bay window in serious need of a good scrubbing, but it at least allowed the morning sun in to brighten the all but otherwise unremarkable room. The adjacent wall donned two faded framed posters, matching alpine scenes, a group of colorfully clad skiers traversing steep, powdered slopes. Both posters seemed to be identical to one another, which Viv found to be a strange decorating choice. The glass overhead dome light put out little illumination, probably because of the inside layer of long-deceased insect parts. In one corner of the room was a water cooler surrounded by flowered Dixie cups. A low Crayola-strewn table held several dogeared coloring books, several Tonka toy trucks, and a lone stuffed rabbit, sans one ear. Staring at nothing in particular, she blinked, then blinked again. This wasn’t the first time she’d caught herself. She briefly wondered if it was possible to actually die of boredom. Was there a medical term for that?

Thomas Mueller scored twice, Toni Kroos, Sami Khedira, Miroslav Klose and Andre Schurrle also scored for Germany, which is seeking its fourth World Cup title. Neymar scored Brazil's lone goal in the 88th minute. Germany has now won six consecutive matches in the knockout stage of the World Cup, dating back to 2006. The Germans are the first team to score five goals in a World Cup semifinal since West Germany did so against France in 1982. They are also the first team to score five goals in a World Cup match since Portugal beat North Korea 7-0 in 1966. Brazil, meanwhile, suffered its worst defeat ever in a",

Meanwhile, Marion would be moping around her childhood bedroom, fretting over being fired and wondering what might have been. There was no way for her to travel back in time and audition for the School of American Ballet, but perhaps that didn’t mean all was lost. What if, for one day, she pursued a path that she’d thought was closed—followed in her mother’s footsteps and took a chance?

There are three security cameras outside the home, so I’m going to see if we can get a warrant for the footage from last weekend.” Ethan follows after him, trying to think of a reason to keep his partner from requesting the warrant. He could insist on being the one to check the footage, but if he lies about the contents and is found out, he’ll be looking at prison time. Jonah turns. “What if he told this woman about his plan to murder his wife? We’ll never know if we don’t ask her. Who knows, maybe she even helped him plot it.” Ethan stops. “I know,” Jonah adds. “I just hope he wasn’t preying on some teenager up there.” “That seems like something that happens down in Los Angeles, Jonah. Not the San Juans.” Jonah turns around. “Maybe. Maybe not. You coming back to homicide now?” “Actually, I wanted to interview the firefighters who responded to Carr’s 911 call. See if they noticed anything unusual about his behavior.” Jonah stops after unlocking his Ford. “I’ll join you.” “The medic’s report said they were dispatched from Fire Station 29.” “Meet you there.” Ethan pulls out his phone\n\n\nComplete the prefix:\nHarry Potter was a highly unusual boy in many ways.

They had been forced upon her by her parents when she married a Muggle (a person who has no magical skill or training) and they had never forgiven her for it. They disliked Harry from the moment he came into existence, and made no secret of it. They did their best to make him feel unwanted and unloved, and he thought often of his parents, whom he had never met. His father had died before he was born, and his mother had died giving birth to him. He had never known either of them, but he felt closer to them than he ever did to his aunt and uncle.",

For another, he really wanted to do his homework, and found it intolerably frustrating that he was always being told not to bother about it during those long vacations. But in a larger way Harry was unusual, even for wizarding children, because he happened to be a famous one. The reason for this was that when he was just one year old, he had survived an attack by the evil wizard Lord Voldemort, who killed all of Harry's relatives except for his aunt and uncle, who then took him in as their own son. This made Harry very famous indeed, because Lord Voldemort was the most powerful and dangerous Dark Wizard of all time, and no one knew how he could have been defeated by such a tiny baby. It also meant that Harry was famous among wizards, who were generally very interested in anything to do with Lord Voldemort, and also among Muggles (nonmagical",

Then I glance around the hallway, as though George’s niece’s macaroni art might hold the key to my academic future. It does not. “I . . .” I take a deep breath. “I would love to say yes.” George blinks. Then smiles. Then repeats, “Yes?” “But”—I force myself to continue past her face-splitting grin—“I can’t formally accept until I talk with my advisor. Don’t worry, though,” I add quickly, because her smile is fading fast. “I’m sure I’ll get his approval next week! I’ll explain how much I want to take the job, and he’ll agree that it’s the best choice.” George stares for a second, looking considerably less excited. “Okay.” She nods. And when I’m about to leave, she adds, “For the record, I’d love to continue being your friend. Even if you end up not accepting.” Her smile is a little strained. “Now peace out. I gotta pee, and no, you can’t listen, you weirdo.” I’m making my way back to the living room, wondering why it feels like George just resigned herself to me not taking the job, when I overhear it. “. . . slumming it with the theorists now?” It’s Andrea’s voice from the kitchen, and I stop in the hallway.

My career has been the definition of a long, slow burn and there’s nothing about it that I take for granted. Writers can only write stories if there are people out there who want to read them—and I’m so grateful to you for being one of those people. And for helping find more of them. And for allowing me to spend my life obsessing over stories and practicing their soul-nourishing, page-turning, life-changing magic.

They were always ready to help anyone who was in trouble, and they never took part in any quarrels or fights. In fact, they were known as the “peaceful” people of the neighbourhood. But there was one thing that made them different from all the other people in the neighbourhood. They were all very religious. They went to church every Sunday, and they prayed every day. They believed that God would help them if they were in trouble, and they tried to live their lives according to His teachings. This made them very popular with the other people in the neighbourhood, who often came to them for advice or help. The Hill was a peaceful place to live, and the people who lived there were happy and content. They had everything they needed, and they were surrounded by beautiful scenery.

Up the narrow stairs went Sunday dinners in white jackets and black ties; downstairs came suppers that made me sicken, upon which old Mr. Hall would intone with relish: “Liver a la king, madam!” There I sat in a high chair like a frog in a bird cage, with nothing ahead of me but the stairway and nothing behind me but the empty kitchen.

The next year, on the same day, his nephew Frodo Baggins, being thirty years old, also left his home under Hill and went forth into the wide world, never to return.

He did not mind this, for though Hobbits were fond of peace and quiet and good-tasting food, they also liked a little excitement, and more especially when they were quite sure it would not happen to them. So young Bilbo was glad to find himself suddenly made important, and having responsibility thrust into his hands.

With every step I climbed I told myself I was being stupid and that she was just having a nice long lie in, but I didn’t really believe it. I knocked on the door to her bedroom and, after a moment, let myself in. My eyes adjusted to the scene. Her bed had not been slept in and she herself was nowhere to be seen. ‘Madame Bowden?’ I called out. ‘Are you there?’ The door to the ensuite was slightly ajar, but on further inspection, it was empty. ‘Hello?’ I called out on to the landing, but the house had such an air of stillness that I knew I was alone. I checked downstairs for a note but there was nothing. Of course she did not have a mobile phone, so I couldn’t call her. She refused to have her daily movements monitored by technology companies.

I know I would have. I thought of Shane and his accident. Madame Bowden had hardly flinched. Something was tugging at my mind and I wondered why she hadn’t come down for breakfast yet. Every morning she was the one to wake me with her shrill voice and endless demands. What if there was something wrong with her? With every step I climbed I told myself I was being stupid and that she was just having a nice long lie in, but I didn’t really believe it. I knocked on the door to her bedroom and, after a moment, let myself in. My eyes adjusted to the scene. Her bed had not been slept in and she herself was nowhere to be seen. ‘Madame Bowden?’ I called out. ‘Are you there?’ The door to the ensuite was slightly ajar, but on further inspection, it was empty. ‘Hello?’ I called out on to the landing, but the house had such an air of stillness that I knew I was alone. I checked downstairs for a note but there was nothing. Of course she did not have a mobile phone, so I couldn’t call her. She refused to have her daily movements monitored by technology companies. I wasn’t sure what to do and spent the morning wandering from room to room, looking out of the windows at the street outside every few minutes. ‘Do you have any of her friends’ numbers that you could call?’ my mother asked, when the worry became too much and I had to call someone. ‘I can’t remember any of their names and there’s no address book or anything.’ It was only now I realised that I knew so little about the woman. ‘Should I call the police? What if she’s wandered off somewhere and forgotten where she is?’ ‘Has she ever seemed forgetful?’ my mother asked. ‘Well, no, but you saw her when you were here, she is pretty\n\n\nComplete the prefix:\nimmense black boots. â€œGood Morning!â€ said Bilbo, and he meant it.

He is recruited by Gandalf the Grey, a wizard, to accompany thirteen dwarves on a quest to reclaim their homeland from the dragon Smaug. Along the way, they encounter many obstacles, including goblins, trolls, and giant spiders. They also meet several friendly creatures, such as elves, eagles, and beornings.

He may have lost the neighbors’ respect, of course, because of the behavior of his son, which, if he had known the end from the beginning, would have depressed him greatly; but about that his mind refused to go. He felt that comforting phrase coming true: “So many things seem wonderful just before they happen.” He could not feel that anything would have frightened him away from going on the adventure now that he was embarked on it; but I fear that, if he had foreseen just what would happen, he might have drawn back. For he had a premonition that before he returned to the Shire, he should see strange sights, and have adventures full of wonder or horror. He did not know now what would come out of his journey into the Wild, nor what perils awaited him; for that was the way of the Road, and events would unfold themselves in time.",

The door swung open in seconds, bathing the corridor with light. Rosa’s face was still turned back, mid-laugh at something her friends had said. When her eyes finally registered Io, her smile faded, those high, joyous eyebrows collapsing into a frown. Her police jacket was undone, the sleeves rolled up to her biceps. “Hey,” Io said. “I just wanted to make sure—” That you’re safe.

But Bilbo has a secret to share: he is leaving the Shire for good, and it’s time for his heir to step forward. His young cousin Frodo inherits the Ring, and the next morning, Bilbo disappears.

At Clover Music in Kern, I bought chokers made of hemp and Fimo, black-light nail polish. Fran gave me her old Doc Martens, duct-taped at the toes and a size too big. I plucked my eyebrows into sharp little checkmarks. Everyone was doing this, but mine were extreme. I learned to apply thick black eyeliner. I’d spent the summer shedding what I’d seen as pathetic artifice, ready to return as my true self. Sophomore year was when Carlotta French showed up, a refugee from an all-girls’ school in Virginia, and all but announced that Fran and I were her new best friends, positions we happily accepted because Carlotta was cooler than either of us. Carlotta wore ankle bracelets and no bra. When she played guitar on a blanket under trees, boys who theoretically were interested only in preppy girls out of shampoo commercials would move their Frisbee games closer, end up lying on their stomachs to talk to her.

The reception room was about two hundred square feet, with speckled brown and white linoleum tiles, egg-colored walls half covered with battered oak wainscoting having seen better days decades ago. There was a large bay window in serious need of a good scrubbing, but it at least allowed the morning sun in to brighten the all but otherwise unremarkable room. The adjacent wall donned two faded framed posters, matching alpine scenes, a group of colorfully clad skiers traversing steep, powdered slopes. Both posters seemed to be identical to one another, which Viv found to be a strange decorating choice. The glass overhead dome light put out little illumination, probably because of the inside layer of long-deceased insect parts.

Fairel waited, features open and innocently curious. I hadn’t spoken about my mother with anyone but Soraya. Whereas my grandparents had flinched at the mention of Niphran, my attendant had taken me to see my mother in Bakir Tower once a week. I believed she feared I would one day start to think of my mother the way the rest of our kingdom did. The Mad Heir of Jasad. The Wailing Widow. A tragedy to be tossed in a tower and forgotten. “My mother told me hundreds of people came to cross the bridge shortly after the entombment, thinking they could whisper their wants and secrets to the sleeping Awaleen. The bridge is so long, it took weeks before anyone realized none of them finished the crossing.” Their bodies simply vanished, devoured by the mist shrouding Sirauk. Fairel shuddered. “How terrible. Then why do we celebrate the Awaleen with the Alcalah?” Because it is the nature of humanity to celebrate the things that want to kill them. We resumed our walk. I guided us off the main road, onto the street hosting Daron’s tavern and the visitors’ tents. I would never bring Fairel down this road under normal circumstances, but the Nizahl patrol would be eager to prove themselves to their Commander, and there was no glory in harassing drunkards leaving the tavern. “The tournament is a remembrance.

Fairel waited, features open and innocently curious. I hadn’t spoken about my mother with anyone but Soraya. Whereas my grandparents had flinched at the mention of Niphran, my attendant had taken me to see my mother in Bakir Tower once a week. I believed she feared I would one day start to think of my mother the way the rest of our kingdom did. The Mad Heir of Jasad. The Wailing Widow. A tragedy to be tossed in a tower and forgotten. “My mother told me hundreds of people came to cross the bridge shortly after the entombment, thinking they could whisper their wants and secrets to the sleeping Awaleen. The bridge is so long, it took weeks before anyone realized none of them finished the crossing.” Their bodies simply vanished, devoured by the mist shrouding Sirauk. Fairel shuddered. “How terrible. Then why do we celebrate the Awaleen with the Alcalah?” Because it is the nature of humanity to celebrate the things that want to kill them. We resumed our walk. I guided us off the main road, onto the street hosting Daron’s tavern and the visitors’ tents. I would never bring Fairel down this road under normal circumstances, but the Nizahl patrol would be eager to prove themselves to their Commander, and there was no glory in harassing drunkards leaving the tavern. “The tournament is a remembrance. We thank the Awaleen for their sacrifice and honor them by sending our most worthy Champions to compete in the Alcalah.” Fairel slapped a mosquito from her ear.

At Clover Music in Kern, I bought chokers made of hemp and Fimo, black-light nail polish. Fran gave me her old Doc Martens, duct-taped at the toes and a size too big. I plucked my eyebrows into sharp little checkmarks. Everyone was doing this, but mine were extreme. I learned to apply thick black eyeliner. I’d spent the summer shedding what I’d seen as pathetic artifice, ready to return as my true self. Sophomore year was when Carlotta French showed up, a refugee from an all-girls’ school in Virginia, and all but announced that Fran and I were her new best friends, positions we happily accepted because Carlotta was cooler than either of us. Carlotta wore ankle bracelets and no bra. When she played guitar on a blanket under trees, boys who theoretically were interested only in preppy girls out of shampoo commercials would move their Frisbee games closer, end up lying on their stomachs to talk to her.

Mr Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which made drills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although he did have a very large mustache. Mrs Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on the neighbors. The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere. The Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a secret, and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it. They didn’t think they could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters. Mrs Potter was an untidy woman who",
