She was very sad about this, because she loved him very much. But she was also very happy, because she knew that she would never be poor again. She decided to use some of her money to help people who were less fortunate than herself. One day, she saw a little girl selling flowers on the street. The girl was very thin and dirty, and she looked very unhappy. The woman bought all the flowers that the girl had, and then she gave her some money. The girl was very surprised, and she started to cry. The woman told her that she wanted to help her, and that she would give her some money every week. The girl was very grateful, and she promised to use the money to buy food and clothes for herself and her family. From that day",

Depending on who you talk to, Geoff is either a manipulative, abusive, gaslighting, insecure leech, or a victim himself. Athena came out pretty clean, but mostly because no one could believe that dating the beautiful and talented Athena Liu was as awful as Geoff made it sound, and because it’s always easier to make the cishet white guy the punching bag. As far as I know, Athena and Geoff hadn’t spoken for months. So what on earth is he targeting me for? After some more sleuthing, I’m certain he’s the one behind all this. His account has faithfully retweeted everything that the @AthenaLiusGhost account has ever tweeted. Sometimes he adds his own quote tweets: Can’t believe no one is talking about this.

It was a hard life, but it was regular and it was quiet, and the hobbit had no wish to go out into the wide world and shift for itself. So morning followed day, and day followed night, and nothing changed. Until one morning when it woke early and went downstairs to put another log on the fire. There it was, standing by the door, a great round thing, a little way off the ground and much too large. The hobbit felt uneasy when it saw it, and yet it seemed to draw him towards it. He walked slowly across the hall and stood before it. Then he reached out and touched it. It was furry and warm. He looked at it and wondered what it could be. It was covered with brownish hair",

Hearing news of this resistance, the other two Survivor Towns had co-ordinated their efforts, sending representatives from the settlements.

Trinity Town, with the most clement weather, contained a large concentration of people interested in their physical and mental welfare, discovering natural medicines in the ocean, a deeply spiritual community with the most places of worship. To this extent, the Peninsula most closely resembled the division of industry in the nation formerly known as Germany, with an industrial heartland, a bohemian Berlin, the financial city of Frankfurt and the spa towns in the mountains.

The hall expanded and then disappeared beneath her. The air changed, grew sweeter, and Alice glided upward to a different realm altogether, one blanketed in a cream-and-gold hush. The bedroom floor. Alice had never felt carpets like this before entering Park Lane. They were so rich, so new. They seemed to suck at her feet. The doors were mirrored and looked as if they’d been glazed with syrup. She adored the bedroom floor. It made her teeth tingle, as if her mouth were filled with sugar. It was heavenly, the home of angels. She waited at the end of the passage, smoothing her apron, listening to the clocks. Straightened her cap. The household machinery tensed, every clock hand poised, straining, ready. “Wait for Madam in the passage,” the house-parlormaid had warned her. “Don’t go and knock. She hates that.” Until now, Miss de Vries had been an entirely remote figure . Nearby, certainly: really only a few feet away if Madam was in the bedroom and Alice was in the dressing room. But she was attended by other servants. Alice observed her, studied her daily movements. She didn’t talk to her at all. The Bond Street seamstresses managed all the fittings for Madam’s ball dress. Alice despised it. It was black, per instruction, suitable for mourning. But the sleeves were fussy, heavy, and the lace looked almost antique in its design.

Alice had never felt carpets like this before entering Park Lane. They were so rich, so new. They seemed to suck at her feet. The doors were mirrored and looked as if they’d been glazed with syrup. She adored the bedroom floor. It made her teeth tingle, as if her mouth were filled with sugar. It was heavenly, the home of angels. She waited at the end of the passage, smoothing her apron, listening to the clocks. Straightened her cap. The household machinery tensed, every clock hand poised, straining, ready. “Wait for Madam in the passage,” the house-parlormaid had warned her. “Don’t go and knock. She hates that.” Until now, Miss de Vries had been an entirely remote figure . Nearby, certainly: really only a few feet away if Madam was in the bedroom and Alice was in the dressing room. But she was attended by other servants. Alice observed her, studied her daily movements. She didn’t talk to her at all. The Bond Street seamstresses managed all the fittings for Madam’s ball dress.

He went straight to Diagon Alley, bought himself a wand, and then walked into Gringotts Bank and opened an account. Now, I don’t know about you, but I think that’s pretty amazing. It shows that Harry Potter had a lot of courage and determination. He wasn’t afraid to take risks and he knew exactly what he wanted. He didn’t let anyone stop him from achieving his goals. That’s why I think Harry Potter is such a great role model for kids today. He shows them that anything is possible if you set your mind to it. So if you want to be just like Harry Potter, start by being brave and determined. Don’t let anyone tell you that you can’t do something. Just go out there and do it!",

You understand?” The ball might have been taking place a hundred miles away. The roar was distant, contained beneath sediment and rock. “Keep me?” said Alice, trying to laugh. “You can’t keep me.” Miss de Vries’s expression changed. “Whyever not?” she said. “Shouldn’t you like it?” Her voice was strained. Miss de Vries was very close, then. It was possible to make out the beating of her pulse. There was something heightened, hectic about it. It matched the rhythm of Alice’s own. Miss de Vries reached for Alice. Her touch wasn’t cool. It transmitted heat. Alice saw Madam’s lips: soft, faintly touched with wine. Would she like it? Alice wondered. The room held its breath. Miss de Vries’s eyes widened, as if checking herself. It was an expression Alice had never seen on Madam’s face before. Uncertainty: delicate, shivering in the heat.

The roar was distant, contained beneath sediment and rock. “Keep me?” said Alice, trying to laugh. “You can’t keep me.” Miss de Vries’s expression changed. “Whyever not?” she said. “Shouldn’t you like it?” Her voice was strained.

Miss de Vries reached for Alice. Her touch wasn’t cool. It transmitted heat. Alice saw Madam’s lips: soft, faintly touched with wine. Would she like it? Alice wondered. The room held its breath.

Finally.” I consider his offer briefly because, well, it’s what I want to do. But I shake my head. “If we get together right now, Lanier will know it’s because we met up at the wedding and she’ll blame me. She’ll be furious.” Huff sighs and rolls his eyes. “Damn, Daph. Why do you care so much? What happened back then was a long time ago. She has to realize that.” He is partially right. But our big breakup, when we were twenty-three and twenty-five, had less to do with her and more with what I’d thought was the right thing. But it was easier to blame her than to blame myself. Seven years ago , I still had my mother’s voice in my head—and her addictive nature in my body. I was afraid then that love would drown me, just like it had my mother. Lanier pleaded with me not to take Huff down with me. I loved him too much to do that. The irony that I later found myself sober, pregnant, and starting a family with a man I didn’t love as much wasn’t lost on me. But instead of saying that, I say, “Huff, you have this big, magical, amazing family. I have Lanier. So losing her would be like losing everything and everyone.” He wraps me in a hug. “You have me, Daphne,” he whispers. “You always have.” He pulls back and kisses me. “You are all I care about. I’m not going to lose you again.” I look up into his sad eyes, and I start to feel that same thing I have always felt for him. And I\n\n\nComplete the prefix:\ndirection of the mouthpiece.

I use the camera’s zoom feature to look closely at the shirtless man’s face. His eyes are wide, his mouth is slightly parted, and there is blood on his neck. “Who is that?” Bezi asks as she peers down at the screen. My mouth suddenly feels dry, and my hands begin to tremble. “I—I think it’s Felix.” Bezi looks at me. “Felix?” “He was supposed to run the office.” My mind runs in circles. “He missed his shift. I thought he quit.” Bezi puts her hand on my shoulder, and I press the button to look at the next picture even though I’m scared to death of what I might see. The photo’s a blur. The hooded figures are hazy, and Felix is lying on his back on the platform in the exact same spot where we’d found the bloody spot someone had tried to wash away. There’s nothing after that. I turn the camera off and set it back down. I have to grip the edge of the counter to steady myself as a terrible thought claws its way to the front of my mind.\n\n\nComplete the prefix:\nThe witch or wizard would perform a basic Flame-Freezing Charm and then pretend to shriek with pain while enjoying a",

The roar was distant, contained beneath sediment and rock. “Keep me?” said Alice, trying to laugh. “You can’t keep me.” Miss de Vries’s expression changed. “Whyever not?” she said. “Shouldn’t you like it?” Her voice was strained. Miss de Vries was very close, then. It was possible to make out the beating of her pulse. There was something heightened, hectic about it. It matched the rhythm of Alice’s own. Miss de Vries reached for Alice. Her touch wasn’t cool. It transmitted heat. Alice saw Madam’s lips: soft, faintly touched with wine. Would she like it? Alice wondered. The room held its breath. Miss de Vries’s eyes widened, as if checking herself. It was an expression Alice had never seen on Madam’s face before. Uncertainty: delicate, shivering in the heat. Alice reached out to touch the most brittle parts of Madam’s dress, around the shoulders. She alone knew where the joins were, where the clasps could be found. It was her strength that loosened them. Miss de Vries closed her eyes. But she didn’t move. She inched closer, the tiniest, clearest fraction. Alice went further. She closed the breach between them. She kissed her mistress, the air wreathed with orchids, lamplight flickering overhead. * * * Winnie stood back from the smoke machines, her nostrils burning. Her scalp was slick with sweat.

Who really knows what happened? Twitter makes unqualified yet eager judges of us all. Depending on who you talk to, Geoff is either a manipulative, abusive, gaslighting, insecure leech, or a victim himself. Athena came out pretty clean, but mostly because no one could believe that dating the beautiful and talented Athena Liu was as awful as Geoff made it sound, and because it’s always easier to make the cishet white guy the punching bag. As far as I know, Athena and Geoff hadn’t spoken for months. So what on earth is he targeting me for? After some more sleuthing, I’m certain he’s the one behind all this. His account has faithfully retweeted everything that the @AthenaLiusGhost account has ever tweeted. Sometimes he adds his own quote tweets: Can’t believe no one is talking about this. Eden, and Juniper Song, should be ashamed. Before that, the only thing he’s tweeted was from over a month ago: Does anyone get weird looks when they ask for “real spicy, not just white people spicy” at Indian restaurants? (This got three likes, and the following response from one RichardBurns08: Me too. Been with my Thai wife for three years now, and they still think this gaijin can’t handle it.

Depending on who you talk to, Geoff is either a manipulative, abusive, gaslighting, insecure leech, or a victim himself. Athena came out pretty clean, but mostly because no one could believe that dating the beautiful and talented Athena Liu was as awful as Geoff made it sound, and because it’s always easier to make the cishet white guy the punching bag. As far as I know, Athena and Geoff hadn’t spoken for months. So what on earth is he targeting me for? After some more sleuthing, I’m certain he’s the one behind all this. His account has faithfully retweeted everything that the @AthenaLiusGhost account has ever tweeted. Sometimes he adds his own quote tweets: Can’t believe no one is talking about this. Eden, and Juniper Song, should be ashamed. Before that, the only thing he’s tweeted was from over a month ago: Does anyone get weird looks when they ask for “real spicy, not just white people spicy” at Indian restaurants?

That’s why we got along,” I reminded her. I paused. “And it’s not like I can blame you.” “What do you mean?” she asked. I paused. “I know it wasn’t easy for you at home. Your parents…” “I’m not about to whine about my rich parents to you,” she said. “Even I’m not that clueless.” “At least my dad never hit me,” I said quietly. I’d seen her bruises. Always where they wouldn’t be noticed. She looked away. “Granted, he was neglectful as fuck and it’s a miracle I didn’t get carted off by raccoons to raise as their own.” She laughed at that, but quickly fell silent. “It wasn’t that bad.

They also knew that the Dark Lord was very powerful and could easily destroy them if he wanted to. So they decided to send a team of Aurors to investigate. The Aurors arrived at the Dark Lord's castle and began searching for clues. They found a lot of evidence that the Dark Lord was planning something, but they couldn't figure out what it was. Finally, one of the Aurors found a note written in blood on the wall. It read: \"I am coming for you, Harry Potter.\" The Aurors immediately realized that the Dark Lord was after Harry Potter. They rushed to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry to warn him. When they arrived, they found Harry Potter sitting in his room, reading a book. He looked up when he saw them and asked what",

As an experienced player, he often notices things that seem mundane but that eventually prove to be essential to a winning strategy. Santana opens an interior door, and Calaphas follows him into a vestibule. “Leave your raincoat. Don’t go drippin’ all over the place.” As they proceed along a hallway toward the lobby at the front of the building, Santana speaks a name and says, “Know who that is?” “He’s a United States senator.” Santana mentions another name. Calaphas says, “Investment fund boss. Oversees trillions.” The third name is Katherine Ormond-Wattley, the director of the ISA, to whom Calaphas answers if he answers to anyone. “Them three,” Santana says, “is so tight with Woodbine they’re Siamese twins.” “Four twins.” “You get what I’m sayin’?” “With some effort.” “Get it outta your head how Woodbine’s just some mouthpiece you can keep waitin’ while you have port.

        "output": " much? The answer lies in the fact that Brazilian football is a game of two halves. In the first half, Brazil are the best team in the world. They play beautiful football, score goals and win games. But in the second half, they lose their way. They become disorganised, make mistakes and concede goals. This is why Brazil have won only one World Cup since 1970. They have the talent to win every tournament, but they lack the discipline to do so. Brazil’s problem is that they rely too heavily on individual brilliance. They have some of the best players in the world, but they don’t know how to use them effectively as a team. When Neymar, Ronaldinho and Ronaldo were at their peak, Brazil were unstoppable. But when those players retired, Brazil struggled to find replacements. They tried to replace Neymar with Philippe Coutinho, but he was never able",

The military dictatorship that ruled Brazil from 1964 to 1985 was overthrown in 1985, but the country remained in chaos. The economy was in shambles, inflation was skyrocketing and crime was rampant. Football suffered as well. The national team failed to qualify for the 1982 World Cup, and the domestic league was in disarray. In the 1990s, things began to improve.

It shows that Harry Potter had a lot of courage and determination. He wasn’t afraid to take risks and he knew exactly what he wanted. He didn’t let anyone stop him from achieving his goals. That’s why I think Harry Potter is such a great role model for kids today. He shows them that anything is possible if you set your mind to it.

And though my father felt so far from me after he died, he no longer feels so distant, lost beyond my reach—it’s as if she has given a part of him back to me now that they are wherever they are, together, my ancestors by love and choice if not by blood. * * * In October, on what would have been my mother’s sixty-ninth birthday, I write her a letter and buy a nice meal to eat at home with my family—nothing fancy, nothing my mom had ever made for me, just something I know she would have enjoyed. (She always, until her final days, ate quickly and with much gusto, a trait I’m sure I got from her.) I can’t visit her grave, with the headstone I chose to match my dad’s, but I send flowers to the cemetery. I order them from the same florist who designed my mother’s memorial flowers, and she promises to use the same colors. The two arrangements are made in different seasons, with different flowers in bloom, so of course they cannot be exactly the same. Nor can a livestreamed funeral provide the same experience, the same companionship or comfort, as one you’re able to attend in person. But neither this life-changing loss nor the depth of gratitude I feel because I had her as a parent can be undermined by the unforeseen, by disease, or by distance. She was my mother. I will miss her forever. In this way, both her absence and my grief are precisely what they would have been, even in an ordinary time. 23 My parents moved into their manufactured home the same year my husband and I moved to North Carolina for his graduate program. I found out they were moving when my mother called and asked me what I wanted to do with my stuff, meaning everything that hadn’t fit in two\n\n\nComplete the prefix:\nyou can't control that owl, it'll have to go!'

This was useful if they had been caught doing something wrong, such as stealing candy from a shop or breaking into someone’s house. The spell was also used by parents who wanted to make sure their children forgot about an embarrassing incident. For example, if a child had accidentally broken a vase, the parent would use the spell to make sure the child forgot about it. The spell was also used by teachers who wanted to make sure their students forgot about an exam they had failed.

He was not only able to resist the Dursleys' attempts to suppress his magical abilities, but also managed to learn a great deal about magic on his own. This caused the Dursleys to become increasingly frustrated with Harry, as they were unable to control him as easily as they had hoped. Despite this, Harry remained resilient and continued to grow stronger in his magical abilities. As he grew older, Harry began to realize the true extent of his powers and the potential he possessed. He also became more aware of the dangers that surrounded him and the importance of protecting himself and those around him. This realization led Harry to seek out allies who could help him hone his skills and prepare for the challenges that lay ahead. With the support of his friends and mentors, Harry was able to develop into a powerful wizard and eventually embark on a journey that would change the course of his life forever",

The Muggle would then be forced to hand over all of his or her money, and the witch or wizard would disappear. The Muggles who were targeted by these scams were usually tourists, who were unfamiliar with the area and therefore more likely to fall victim to such tricks.

Harry had been looking forward to seeing Dudley again, because it had been two years since he’d last seen him. But now Harry was feeling nervous. He didn’t really know what to do with Dudley. He couldn’t think of anything to talk about except Quidditch, and Dudley didn’t seem interested in that. Harry turned over onto his back and stared at the ceiling again. He thought about how he’d spent most of the day trying to avoid Dudley. He’d gone down to the kitchen to make himself some toast, but Dudley had been there,",

However, there were some exceptions to this rule. For example, if a person was being attacked by a dangerous creature, such as a dragon or a troll, they were allowed to use magic to defend themselves. This was because the Ministry believed that it was better to have a few people using magic in self-defense than to have everyone running around in fear of being attacked. Of course, there were also some people who used magic for evil purposes. These people were called Dark Wizards, and they were punished very severely. They were often sent to Azkaban, a prison located on an island in the middle of the sea. There, they were kept in solitary confinement and forced to do hard labor. Some people thought that the Ministry was too harsh on Dark Wizards, but most",

The glass overhead dome light put out little illumination, probably because of the inside layer of long-deceased insect parts.

The adjacent wall donned two faded framed posters, matching alpine scenes, a group of colorfully clad skiers traversing steep, powdered slopes. Both posters seemed to be identical to one another, which Viv found to be a strange decorating choice. The glass overhead dome light put out little illumination, probably because of the inside layer of long-deceased insect parts. In one corner of the room was a water cooler surrounded by flowered Dixie cups. A low Crayola-strewn table held several dogeared coloring books, several Tonka toy trucks, and a lone stuffed rabbit, sans one ear. Staring at nothing in particular, she blinked, then blinked again.

Everyone loved Grif.

There were tales of goblins and wolves and dragons, and of a dark power that lay hidden in the south. But the Shire-folk paid little attention to such tales, and they went on with their quiet lives, until one day a stranger came to Bag End. His name was Gandalf, and he was a wizard. He told Bilbo Baggins that he had been sent by the Council of the Wise to look after him, and to help him on his journey. Bilbo was not sure what to make of this strange visitor, but he agreed to let him stay for a while. And so began an adventure that would change the course of history.

This story begins in the Shire, which is said to be at once the oldest and the most peaceful of the hobbit lands. Here everything used to move at a slow pace, like the water of the River running past Hobbiton. But that was before the Great War. Now the Shire is changing fast. The old forest has been cut down, and the trees are all gone. The fields have been ploughed up, and now there are great roads and many new houses. And the river is full of boats, and the roads are full of carts, and the farms are full of men working. Some of them are good workers, but some are not. The Shire looks very different now from what it used to look like. And in the middle of the changes something else is happening as well.",

When their uncle Arthur had a heart attack and drove his riding lawn mower through a greenhouse, she’d told Mark and Louise that she and their dad were going to Myrtle Beach for a vacation, then parked them with Aunt Honey. When Sue Estes’s older sister died of leukemia in fifth grade, Louise’s mom had told her she was too young to go to the funeral. Her friendship with Sue was never the same after that. Louise’s mom had claimed to be allergic to all pets, including goldfish, for their entire childhoods, and it wasn’t until Louise got out of grad school that her mom revealed she’d simply never wanted anything in the house that might die. “It would have upset you and your brother too much,” she’d explained. When Louise had Poppy, she vowed to be honest about death. She knew that stating the facts plainly would be the best way for Poppy to understand that death was part of life. She would answer all Poppy’s questions with absolute honesty, and if she didn’t know something they’d figure out the answer together. “I’m going to Charleston tomorrow,” Louise told Poppy that night, sitting on the story-time chair beside her bed, in the glow of the plastic goose lamp. “And I want you to understand why. Your grandmother and grandfather had a very bad accident.” Louise saw safety glass exploding, metal tearing and twisting. “And their bodies got hurt very badly.

When their uncle Arthur had a heart attack and drove his riding lawn mower through a greenhouse, she’d told Mark and Louise that she and their dad were going to Myrtle Beach for a vacation, then parked them with Aunt Honey. When Sue Estes’s older sister died of leukemia in fifth grade, Louise’s mom had told her she was too young to go to the funeral. Her friendship with Sue was never the same after that. Louise’s mom had claimed to be allergic to all pets, including goldfish, for their entire childhoods, and it wasn’t until Louise got out of grad school that her mom revealed she’d simply never wanted anything in the house that might die. “It would have upset you and your brother too much,” she’d explained. When Louise had Poppy, she vowed to be honest about death. She knew that stating the facts plainly would be the best way for Poppy to understand that death was part of life. She would answer all Poppy’s questions with absolute honesty, and if she didn’t know something they’d figure out the answer together. “I’m going to Charleston tomorrow,” Louise told Poppy that night, sitting on the story-time chair beside her bed, in the glow of the plastic goose lamp. “And I want you to understand why. Your grandmother and grandfather had a very bad accident.” Louise saw safety glass exploding, metal tearing and twisting. “And their bodies got hurt very badly.

I assumed he would have told you.” I winced. “Egilson and I have not been on the best of terms.” “What?” He gave an exaggerated affectation of surprise. “Dear Emily.

But I am afraid I cannot stay long. I have business to attend to in London, and I must be off tomorrow morning.” “Ah! Well, I suppose you can’t help that. But I wish you could stay longer. We have some very interesting people here, and I think you would find them all most agreeable. There is Mr. Bambleby, for instance. He is a very clever fellow, and knows a great deal about everything. Then there is Miss Lizzie, who is a very pretty girl, and has a great deal of sense. And then there is myself, of course.

But instead of saying that, I say, “Huff, you have this big, magical, amazing family. I have Lanier. So losing her would be like losing everything and everyone.” He wraps me in a hug. “You have me, Daphne,” he whispers. “You always have.” He pulls back and kisses me. “You are all I care about.

His tone was sinister. I didn’t think he was asking people to keep me in their thoughts and prayers out of kindness. My older sister was visiting when the program came out. She barricaded herself in the guest room that night, placing her oversized luggage against the door. Family members like her were also on the receiving end of virtual harassment from dark corners of the web. Nonetheless, they told me not to let the MAGA antagonists win. Voters needed to hear the truth before it was too late. So I went for broke. I agreed to as many interviews as possible to talk about who Trump really was, detailing as much as I could to anyone who would listen. The growing media exposure led to a stream of angry messages from MAGA strangers. As a precaution, I went to the shooting range to practice with my concealed\n\n\nComplete the prefix:\nmy dear sir!

I would never again risk poisoning TNO for myself by falling for or trying to date anyone there. And this decision made me see that there was a different way I wrote when, even subconsciously, I was seeking male approval, male sexual approval: a more coy way, more reserved, more nervous about being perceived as angry or vulgar. It was the syntactical equivalent of dressing up as a sexy zombie for Halloween. From my third season on, I’d embraced my anger and vulgarity. I’d been a gross zombie. I began writing about ostensibly female topics—camel toe and wage inequity, polycystic ovary syndrome and Jane Austen, Do-si-dos and Trefoils and mammograms and shapewear and Dirty Dancing and the so-called likeability of female politicians. By October of that year, I’d written my first viral sketch, Nancy Drew and the Disappearing Access to Abortion, in which Henrietta played the amateur detective.

A university is a small, fractious mini-state all its own, and it has heroes and villains and victims of circumstance and it is not always easy to tell them apart when you’re in the top chair. On the other hand, if you are just some guy, you might be able to go somewhere and ignore certain things that you see, and escort a talented young person home from what might otherwise be a bad place for them and their sparkling future. If you’re in the top chair and you’re a little devious—which is kind of a basic qualification for the job—you might seek out such a person so as to know who to call if ever the need arose, and if you were that kind of person, you might make it your business to let that be known, so that your name comes up at the right time. Nine times, actually, in six years. “It’s so good to see you, Cal. And look: the winter honeysuckle is very fine this year. And the quince.” “I’m a sucker for quince, Bill.

Against the back wall of that space is a pegboard on which only a few electronic keys hang. As an experienced player, he often notices things that seem mundane but that eventually prove to be essential to a winning strategy. Santana opens an interior door, and Calaphas follows him into a vestibule. “Leave your raincoat. Don’t go drippin’ all over the place.” As they proceed along a hallway toward the lobby at the front of the building, Santana speaks a name and says, “Know who that is?” “He’s a United States senator.” Santana mentions another name. Calaphas says, “Investment fund boss. Oversees trillions.” The third name is Katherine Ormond-Wattley, the director of the ISA, to whom Calaphas answers if he answers to anyone. “Them three,” Santana says, “is so tight with Woodbine they’re Siamese twins.” “Four twins.” “You get what I’m sayin’?” “With some effort.” “Get it outta your head how Woodbine’s just some mouthpiece you can keep waitin’ while you have port.

This is very unusual behavior for them. They are normally shy and timid creatures. These attacks have been happening more frequently in recent months. This is concerning because it means that something must be wrong with the environment. The birds may be sick or injured. They may also be stressed out by changes in their habitat. Whatever the reason, it is important to take steps to protect yourself if you see one of these birds. Do not approach it or try to touch it. If possible, stay away from it until it flies away. If you are attacked, seek medical attention immediately. These birds can carry diseases that can be harmful to humans. It is also important to report any sightings of these birds to local authorities. This information can help scientists understand what is causing this change in behavior and take steps to protect the birds and the environment.",

Viv watched as Meg and Wyatt settled into two straight-back molded plastic seats. It was as if time had stood still here in this small town. The so-called hospital was more like a health clinic straight out of the twentieth century. The reception room was about two hundred square feet, with speckled brown and white linoleum tiles, egg-colored walls half covered with battered oak wainscoting having seen better days decades ago. There was a large bay window in serious need of a good scrubbing, but it at least allowed the morning sun in to brighten the all but otherwise unremarkable room. The adjacent wall donned two faded framed posters, matching alpine scenes, a group of colorfully clad skiers traversing steep, powdered slopes. Both posters seemed to be identical to one another, which Viv found to be a strange decorating choice. The glass overhead dome light put out little illumination, probably because of the inside layer of long-deceased insect parts.

Viv watched as Meg and Wyatt settled into two straight-back molded plastic seats. It was as if time had stood still here in this small town. The so-called hospital was more like a health clinic straight out of the twentieth century. The reception room was about two hundred square feet, with speckled brown and white linoleum tiles, egg-colored walls half covered with battered oak wainscoting having seen better days decades ago. There was a large bay window in serious need of a good scrubbing, but it at least allowed the morning sun in to brighten the all but otherwise unremarkable room. The adjacent wall donned two faded framed posters, matching alpine scenes, a group of colorfully clad skiers traversing steep, powdered slopes. Both posters seemed to be identical to one another, which Viv found to be a strange decorating choice. The glass overhead dome light put out little illumination, probably because of the inside layer of long-deceased insect parts.

Who really knows what happened? Twitter makes unqualified yet eager judges of us all. Depending on who you talk to, Geoff is either a manipulative, abusive, gaslighting, insecure leech, or a victim himself. Athena came out pretty clean, but mostly because no one could believe that dating the beautiful and talented Athena Liu was as awful as Geoff made it sound, and because it’s always easier to make the cishet white guy the punching bag. As far as I know, Athena and Geoff hadn’t spoken for months. So what on earth is he targeting me for? After some more sleuthing, I’m certain he’s the one behind all this. His account has faithfully retweeted everything that the @AthenaLiusGhost account has ever tweeted. Sometimes he adds his own quote tweets: Can’t believe no one is talking about this. Eden, and Juniper Song, should be ashamed. Before that, the only thing he’s tweeted was from over a month ago: Does anyone get weird looks when they ask for “real spicy, not just white people spicy” at Indian restaurants? (This got three likes, and the following response from one RichardBurns08: Me too. Been with my Thai wife for three years now, and they still think this gaijin can’t handle it. Love to prove them wrong!) The timing is too convenient. I have to act fast. Geoff is an idiot, but he’s an unstable, unpredictable idiot. Best to nip this in the bud. I think I can hold my own against him, but I’d like to know exactly what he has up his sleeve.

They had promised to finish the job by Friday, but they hadn’t finished it until Saturday morning. And then they had left their tools lying around. Uncle Vernon had to spend all Saturday cleaning up after them. He was so angry that he didn’t even bother to change his clothes before going to meet the builders. He went straight to the pub instead. He was still there when Aunt Petunia arrived home from work. She was furious. She had been looking forward to having a nice meal with her husband and the builders. Instead, she found him drunk and dirty. She told him off and sent him to bed. He didn’t come downstairs again until Sunday morning. By then, the builders had gone.
