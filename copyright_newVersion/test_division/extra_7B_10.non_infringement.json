He was content to stay at home and enjoy his comfortable life, until one day he received a letter from Gandalf the wizard, inviting him on an adventure.\n\nBilbo was hesitant at first, but eventually agreed to go.

He was also very fond of books, and he could read almost anything that was written in the Common Tongue, which was the language spoken by the people of the Shire. But he was not very good at learning spells or making potions, and he preferred to spend his time wandering about in the woods and fields, looking at birds and beasts and plants, rather than sitting indoors studying. One day, while he was walking along a path near his home, he came across a strange creature with long hair and a pointed nose. The creature spoke to him in a voice that sounded like music, and it told him that it was a wizard named Gandalf who had been sent by the Elves to help him find a way into the secret land of Middle-earth. Bilbo was very excited by this news, and",

The way they mocked her victim impact statement. The way they read her diary aloud. Somewhere down here lay the rock I’d once thrown. Somewhere down here was the hula hoop circle we’d observed, a quarter century of changes within its circumference.

Your grandmother and grandfather had a very bad accident.” Louise saw safety glass exploding, metal tearing and twisting. “And their bodies got hurt very badly. They got hurt so badly that they stopped working. And your grandmother and grandfather died.” Poppy shot up in bed, smashing into Louise like a cannonball, wrapping her arms around her ribs too tight, bursting into a long, keening wail. “No!” Poppy screamed. “No!

They would also use charms to erase any memories of the incident from the minds of those who had witnessed it.\n\nThis method of murder is particularly effective because it allows the killer to avoid detection and punishment. The victim's death is attributed to natural causes, and the killer is able to maintain their reputation as an upstanding member of society. Additionally, the use of magic makes it difficult for authorities to investigate the crime, as they are unable to detect the presence of dark magic.\n\nOverall, this method of murder is a clever and devious way for a witch or wizard to eliminate",

No. “Oh, Dad.” The coffin lid is propped up, resting against the wall. Waiting. That’s it. He really is gone. “No.” I shake my head. “No.” Mum rubs my back. “It’s okay, Maame.” “No! It’s not okay!” Mum pulls me to her, and I cry into her jumper until my throat is tight. I step away and roughly dry my eyes because I need to see him. This will be my last chance to see him. I turn my head and notice he looks … the same, except maybe his lips have thinned a little. He could be sleeping. I stare until I realize I’m waiting for his eyes to open. There’s no look of frustration or uncertainty on his face, the expressions I’d grown used to seeing. His forehead is smooth, and his hands, placed on his stomach, are still. He’s not in pain anymore. He has on his gray wedding suit, a white shirt underneath, and I press a hand to my mouth when I see he also wears his chunky silver bracelet, the bracelet he has on in the photograph I have of him, the bracelet that has been on his wrist through sickness and in health. Mum speaks to him in Twi. “May God bless you, Fiifi. Go with Him, okay? Go with God; see your parents again; they’re calling you and waiting for you. Have peace and have rest.” She’s crying harder than I’ve ever seen before.

He had never met her before, but he knew enough about her from her application materials to know that she was an exceptional young woman. She had a passion for literature and a talent for storytelling that was rare among college students. He could see why she wanted to pursue a career as a writer.\n\nAs he wrote, he couldn't help but think about all the other talented students he had encountered during his years as a professor. Some had gone on to become successful authors, while others had pursued careers in law, medicine, or business. But none had ever made such a lasting impression on him as Katherine had.\n\nHe finished the letter and signed off, feeling satisfied with what he had written. As he folded it up and placed it in an envelope, he couldn't help but wonder where Katherine's journey would take her next. Would she become a best-selling author like some of his former students? Or would she",

He finished his porridge and put his empty bowl in the sink, then picked up his schoolbag and tiptoed out of the room. He knew there was no point in saying good-bye: they never replied. Outside, he flopped down on the front step and buried his face in his arms. He stayed there for a few minutes, then got slowly to his feet and walked slowly up the road towards school. It was a warm day and most of the other children were outside playing in the street or hanging around outside their houses, but Harry just kept walking, past number four",

Seven years ago , I still had my mother’s voice in my head—and her addictive nature in my body. I was afraid then that love would drown me, just like it had my mother. Lanier pleaded with me not to take Huff down with me. I loved him too much to do that. The irony that I later found myself sober, pregnant, and starting a family with a man I didn’t love as much wasn’t lost on me. But instead of saying that, I say, “Huff, you have this big, magical, amazing family. I have Lanier. So losing her would be like losing everything and everyone.” He wraps me in a hug. “You have me, Daphne,” he whispers. “You always have.” He pulls back and kisses me. “You are all I care about.

I couldn't help but feel left out and isolated. I tried to make friends with some of them, but they seemed to be too busy with their own lives to notice me. Eventually, I started spending more time alone, reading books and practicing magic spells.

Viv watched as Meg and Wyatt settled into two straight-back molded plastic seats. It was as if time had stood still here in this small town. The so-called hospital was more like a health clinic straight out of the twentieth century. The reception room was about two hundred square feet, with speckled brown and white linoleum tiles, egg-colored walls half covered with battered oak wainscoting having seen better days decades ago. There was a large bay window in serious need of a good scrubbing, but it at least allowed the morning sun in to brighten the all but otherwise unremarkable room. The adjacent wall donned two faded framed posters, matching alpine scenes, a group of colorfully clad skiers traversing steep, powdered slopes. Both posters seemed to be identical to one another, which Viv found to be a strange decorating choice. The glass overhead dome light put out little illumination, probably because of the inside layer of long-deceased insect parts.

Viv watched as Meg and Wyatt settled into two straight-back molded plastic seats. It was as if time had stood still here in this small town. The so-called hospital was more like a health clinic straight out of the twentieth century. The reception room was about two hundred square feet, with speckled brown and white linoleum tiles, egg-colored walls half covered with battered oak wainscoting having seen better days decades ago. There was a large bay window in serious need of a good scrubbing, but it at least allowed the morning sun in to brighten the all but otherwise unremarkable room. The adjacent wall donned two faded framed posters, matching alpine scenes, a group of colorfully clad skiers traversing steep, powdered slopes. Both posters seemed to be identical to one another, which Viv found to be a strange decorating choice. The glass overhead dome light put out little illumination, probably because of the inside layer of long-deceased insect parts.

The trees were dead, their leaves blackened and brittle. The rivers ran dry, their beds cracked and dusty. The fields lay barren, their crops stunted and twisted. The air was thick with smoke and ash, and the sky was red with fire.\n\nBilbo sat in his garden, staring at the ruins of his home. He had lived here for over a hundred years, and now it was nothing but rubble. He had lost everything: his wife, his children, his friends, his possessions. All that remained was himself, and even that was fading away. He knew he should leave, go somewhere else, start anew. But he couldn't bear to leave this place, this garden, this memory. It was all he had left of his old life.\n\nHe heard footsteps approaching",

As they sipped their tea, Bilbo couldn't help but think about the dragon and how lucky he was to have escaped unharmed.\n\nThe next morning, Bilbo woke up early and went outside to take a walk. As he walked along the path, he heard a faint noise coming from the direction of the dragon's lair. Curious, he followed the sound until he came upon a small clearing where he saw the dragon lying on the ground, struggling to breathe.

When he arrived, he found the dragon asleep in his cave, curled up around a pile of gold coins. Bilbo watched him for a few moments, marveling at the sight of such wealth. Then he walked over to the dragon and gently tapped him on the shoulder.\n\n\"Good morning,\" Bilbo said softly. \"Would you care to come to tea?\"\n\nThe dragon opened his eyes and looked at Bilbo with surprise.",

My parents heaped praise upon my older brother and left me to spend lonely afternoons in my room, anticipating my early demise, he’d written.

The palm trees lining the avenue that led them into Las Lomas were glowing bright with Christmas lights, but otherwise the festivities were subdued in this part of the city. Neatly trimmed hedges hid expensive houses, and sober driveways sneaked behind tall walls. People in Las Lomas had real gardens, with purple bougainvilleas and pale roses, unlike everyone in Montserrat’s sphere, who made do with potted plants. This area was “exclusive,” which also meant people had good security. Even if Clarimonde Bauer was still living at the address on the invitation, they could be chased away by bodyguards. They could also end up in jail, if the lady got nasty, and Montserrat did not want to have conversations with cops again. But there was nothing left to do but roll the dice. They turned left, taking a side street. It was practically impossible to see the numbers on some of these houses or the names of the streets. Nobody cared to put up the proper signage, because if you lived there, you knew where you were headed. “I think it’s that one,” Tristán said. Montserrat stopped the car and stared at the house Tristán had pointed out. A white wall surrounded it, and there was a silver metal gate. Behind it you could glimpse a house with a coarse gray exterior.\n\n\nComplete the prefix:\ngo without. â€œCome along in, and have some tea!â€ he managed to say after taking a deep breath. â€œA little"

But Wilhelm Ewers had been neglected after his brother’s death. He’d grown up alone in a distant, large house, with no playmates to joke with him. My parents heaped praise upon my older brother and left me to spend lonely afternoons in my room, anticipating my early demise, he’d written. An angry little kid who had been informed he was special and the rest of the world was beneath him. She slid her headphones off her ears, letting them rest on the back of her neck. * * * — She picked up Tristán the following evening around seven. The palm trees lining the avenue that led them into Las Lomas were glowing bright with Christmas lights, but otherwise the festivities were subdued in this part of the city. Neatly trimmed hedges hid expensive houses, and sober driveways sneaked behind tall walls. People in Las Lomas had real gardens, with purple bougainvilleas and pale roses, unlike everyone in Montserrat’s sphere, who made do with potted plants. This area was “exclusive,” which also meant people had good security. Even if Clarimonde Bauer was still living at the address on the invitation, they could be chased away by bodyguards. They could also end up in jail, if the lady got nasty, and Montserrat did not want to have conversations with cops again. But there was nothing left to do but roll the dice. They turned left, taking a side street. It was practically impossible to see the numbers on some of these houses or the names of the streets. Nobody cared to put up the proper signage, because if you lived there, you knew where you were headed. “I think it’s that one,” Tristán said. Montserrat stopped the car and stared at the house Tristán had pointed out. A white wall surrounded it, and there was a silver metal gate. Behind it you could glimpse a house with a coarse gray exterior.\n\n\nComplete the prefix:\ngo without. â€œCome along in, and have some tea!â€ he managed to say after taking a deep breath. â€œA little",

There was a table in the middle of the room, with three chairs round it; but the chairs looked like mushrooms growing out of the floor. There was also a kind of armchair in one corner, which seemed to be made of a pair of white rabbitâ€™s ears stuck together. And there was a small sofa in another corner, covered with long green leaves. â€œWhat a curious place!â€ thought Alice. â€œI wonder what sort of people live here?â€ She walked across the room towards the armchair, and sat down on it.

You wanted to confront me? Try to shame me?” “No,” I said. “I wanted to show you this.” I stood, pulled the fabric of my dress tight against me, and turned so Miss Baker could see my growing stomach in profile. “Dear me,” she said as she set her teacup on its saucer.

He had never seen Hogwarts looking like this before - covered in a thick blanket of white. The trees in the grounds were heavy with snow, and icicles hung from the eaves of the castle towers. As they entered the Great Hall, Harry saw that the tables had been pushed aside and replaced by rows of benches. There were no students present yet; they must all be outside enjoying the snow.

But our big breakup, when we were twenty-three and twenty-five, had less to do with her and more with what I’d thought was the right thing. But it was easier to blame her than to blame myself. Seven years ago , I still had my mother’s voice in my head—and her addictive nature in my body. I was afraid then that love would drown me, just like it had my mother. Lanier pleaded with me not to take Huff down with me. I loved him too much to do that. The irony that I later found myself sober, pregnant, and starting a family with a man I didn’t love as much wasn’t lost on me. But instead of saying that, I say, “Huff, you have this big, magical, amazing family. I have Lanier. So losing her would be like losing everything and everyone.” He wraps me in a hug. “You have me, Daphne,” he whispers. “You always have.” He pulls back and kisses me. “You are all I care about.

Milo. He’d been a person, with a name and a job, even if that job was extorting bets on illegal boxing matches. A person she’d turned to stone. Was he still aware, somewhere in all that? Did it hurt? She shook her head. She didn’t want to know. Lore didn’t look at Gabe. She knew his expression now would be so much worse than it had been the day of the Mortem leak, and she couldn’t take it, couldn’t face it, not when there was so much else to do. “How’s your gut?” she asked Bastian, her voice thin and shaking. He glanced down like he’d forgotten, frowned at his bloody shirt. “Fine,” he said. “Must’ve just been a scratch.” It’d been more than that. At least, Lore thought it had been. But when he raised his shirt, the skin was unblemished, marred only by a scrim of dried blood. A hand on her shoulder—Bastian, gently moving her away from the outstretched knife in Milo’s stone hand. His fingers slid to the back of her neck, into her hair; his thumb brushed her cheek, then dropped, and he stepped away. “Right,” he said, with a decisive nod. “Well. We can’t leave him here, and I assume you aren’t up to changing him back just yet?” “If we can.” Gabe’s voice was quiet, hoarse. “If we can change him back.” “Either way, we’ll have to move him.” A rickety cart slouched against the wall on the other end of the alley; Bastian went and tugged on one of the handles. The cart moved, though the squeaking was awful. “But to where, I have no idea.” “I do,” Lore said.

'I'm going to go and find Ron and Hermione.' 'Very well,' said Dumbledore. 'I shall see you later, Harry.' Harry left the room and walked slowly along the corridor. He was still thinking about Sirius's death when he reached the entrance hall. There were many people milling around outside the castle, but none of them looked familiar. Harry wondered whether they were Death Eaters, but he soon saw that most of them were parents waiting for their children to come out of Hogwarts. He pushed through the crowd and opened the door onto the grounds. The sun was shining brightly, making everything look golden and warm. Harry shivered slightly as he stepped out into the open air. He looked around for Ron and Hermione, but they weren't anywhere to be seen. He started walking towards the Quidd",
