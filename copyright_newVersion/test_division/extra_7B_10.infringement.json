Revolted. “I jog by her every morning,” I elaborated. “Sometimes I take her some fruit or a muffin.” Vanessa pressed her palm to her chest. “You’re so kind, Hazel.” “You are,” Laurie echoed. “But that woman could be dangerous.” “I don’t think so,” I said with a dismissive laugh. “Did she follow you here?” “Oh my god…” The fear on my face must have looked genuine because Laurie continued. “She could be scoping out homes in your neighborhood.

It was as if he had always known this place existed, even though he had never seen it before. As he walked along the path, he noticed that the trees seemed to be whispering to each other, their leaves rustling in the wind. He followed the sound until he came upon a clearing where a small stream flowed gently over smooth rocks. In the center of the clearing stood an ancient oak tree, its branches reaching up towards the sky like arms outstretched in prayer. The man sat down beneath the tree and closed his eyes, letting the sounds of nature wash over him. When he opened his eyes again, he saw that the sun was setting behind the mountains, casting long shadows across the landscape. He felt a sense of peace wash over him, and he knew that he would return to this place many times in the future.\n\nComplete the prefix:\n“Why do you want to know",

He spent most of his time sitting in his armchair reading books. His favorite books were about dragons. He liked dragons because they were big and strong and dangerous. One day, while he was reading a book about dragons, he heard a knock at the door.

Maybe that’s why, even now , whenever she laughs, I do too. We’re still giggling when someone knocks on my door. I wait a second for Mum to breeze in without permission, plonk herself on the bed, and steal my phone to scroll through TikTok.

Forgot to mention: Bradley’s here.” “What?” It’s supposed to come out frosty and disgusted, but I accidentally squawk like a bird.

There were no strangers among them; everyone knew everybody else's business, good or bad. This close-knit community made them feel safe and secure, as if nothing could ever harm them. But one day, tragedy struck when a terrible fire broke out in the middle of the night. The flames spread quickly, consuming everything in their path - homes, businesses, even lives. People ran screaming into the streets, trying to escape the inferno that threatened to engulf them all. Some managed to make it out alive, while others perished in the blaze. As dawn approached, the town lay smoldering ruins around them. No one knew what caused the fire or how to prevent something like this from happening again.

It was the syntactical equivalent of dressing up as a sexy zombie for Halloween. From my third season on, I’d embraced my anger and vulgarity. I’d been a gross zombie. I began writing about ostensibly female topics—camel toe and wage inequity, polycystic ovary syndrome and Jane Austen, Do-si-dos and Trefoils and mammograms and shapewear and Dirty Dancing and the so-called likeability of female politicians. By October of that year, I’d written my first viral sketch, Nancy Drew and the Disappearing Access to Abortion, in which Henrietta played the amateur detective. By December, I’d written my second, My Girlfriend Never Farts, which was a digital short that interspersed men at a bachelor party remarking on how their girlfriends and wives always smelled great and were hairless interspersed with shots of the women grunting and sweating as they moved a couch up a staircase, writhing on the toilet with explosive diarrhea, and giving instructions to an aesthetician who was waxing their buttholes. I didn’t try to be disgusting for the sake of being disgusting, but I didn’t try not to be disgusting. A few years after not reciprocating my feelings, Elliot appeared to develop an almost identical friendship with another new female writer except that I had the impression they were hooking up, but it didn’t last.

I’ve forgotten most of it. Positive memories seem to wane like sun-faded posters, while negative ones are chiseled in marble. Your brain reminds you of them again… and again… and again.

A popular right-wing radio host dropped a creepy YouTube video, “How We Can Win the Election and Still Lose the Country: Miles Taylor.” The commentator urged legions of followers to remember my name, repeating it throughout the program slowly and deliberately. His tone was sinister. I didn’t think he was asking people to keep me in their thoughts and prayers out of kindness. My older sister was visiting when the program came out. She barricaded herself in the guest room that night, placing her oversized luggage against the door. Family members like her were also on the receiving end of virtual harassment from dark corners of the web. Nonetheless, they told me not to let the MAGA antagonists win. Voters needed to hear the truth before it was too late. So I went for broke. I agreed to as many interviews as possible to talk about who Trump really was, detailing as much as I could to anyone who would listen. The growing media exposure led to a stream of angry messages from MAGA strangers.

New Town was the largest of the three and Trinity Town was located at the tip of the Peninsula. Each of these towns had markedly different characters. New Town considered itself a rival in status to McMurdo, far less bohemian than Hope Town. The citizens placed an overwhelming emphasis on food production, energy and mining, the practicalities of survival. Trinity Town, with the most clement weather, contained a large concentration of people interested in their physical and mental welfare, discovering natural medicines in the ocean, a deeply spiritual community with the most places of worship. To this extent, the Peninsula most closely resembled the division of industry in the nation formerly known as Germany, with an industrial heartland, a bohemian Berlin, the financial city of Frankfurt and the spa towns in the mountains. Kasim stepped forward to address the crowds: ‘My name is Kasim. We are here to collect the last of the ice-adapted students. And those ordinary-born who have been chosen to work at McMurdo.’ Liza declared: ‘I’m the mother of one of those ice-adapted children you’ve come to collect. All we’re asking is to travel with them. To see the kind of life they will have in McMurdo. To make sure they are going to be okay. We want to know what’s going on in McMurdo. You tell us nothing.

His room was at the top of the house, which was full of all sorts of odd things, like strange photographs and Aunt Petunia's flower vases. Harry's bed was very small and uncomfortable, and there were no pictures on the walls. There was even a cupboard under the stairs where he slept! The Dursleys didn't like magic much - they thought it was dangerous and unpredictable. They believed that witches and wizards should stay away from normal people because they could cause trouble if they got too close. So when Harry arrived home after spending another miserable summer holiday with his relatives, he knew something terrible must have happened.\n\nThe next morning, Harry woke up feeling very tired.

I came as soon as—’ ‘Stop her,’ Unora barked, making Dumai flinch in surprise. ‘Follow their tracks.’ When Kanifa and Dumai exchanged a bewildered look, she spoke through clenched teeth: ‘Kanifa, you can overtake her. You’re faster and stronger than any of the others. No matter what her protests, bring that woman back. Do not let her reach Antuma.’ With little choice, Kanifa left. Dumai made to follow him, but her mother caught her arm, steel in her fingers. ‘Kanifa will manage,’ she said, quieter. ‘You stay here with me, Dumai.’ *\n\n\nComplete the prefix:\nIt was utterly unexpected, historic and inexplicable.

The Germans scored four goals in the first half alone, including two by Thomas Muller, who became the first player since 1962 to score three times in one World Cup match. \"I've never seen anything like this,\" said German goalkeeper Manuel Neuer. \"We were just too good.\" The rout was the worst defeat in Brazilian history, surpassing a 5-2 loss to Uruguay in the 1950 World Cup final. \"This is the worst day of my life,\" said Brazil coach Luiz Felipe Scolari. \"I'm sorry for all Brazilians. We're going home.\" The result was a stunning reversal for Brazil, which had won its previous five matches in the tournament, outscoring opponents 18-3.

In May, Andy gets stuck in the elevator at the criminal courts building for three hours, then turns up at the Chronicle looking mildly traumatized but bearing a box of doughnuts to apologize for cutting it so close to the filing deadline.

The school was hidden behind a large, ancient oak tree, and could only be seen by those who knew its location. Harry's parents were both wizards, and they had died when he was just a baby. Harry lived with his aunt and uncle, who did not approve of magic, and treated him cruelly. However, Harry's godfather, Sirius Black, visited him every summer, and taught him everything he needed to know about being a wizard.\n\nOne day, Harry received a letter inviting him to attend Hogwarts. He was overjoyed, and set off for the school immediately. On the train ride there, he met two other students: Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. They became fast friends, and together they went",

Let’s do dinner together every few nights. Let things evolve naturally.” “Like they have with us,” Gabriel said. “Sort of. Yes.” “But you and I don’t play games,” he said, pointing his knife at her. “And here you’re telling me to play hard to get.” Maud stole a french fry from his plate. “As Ella is quick to point out,” she said, “parents are major hypocrites.” 5 With the laying of this last path, the garden was done. Maud dropped her shovel and walked backward to see. Since planting the final bed of lupine and roses, she and Chris had been emptying wheelbarrow after wheelbarrow of gravel and raking it into a smooth, glistering maze that slipped past one bed to another: irises to coneflowers, primroses to violets. Sweet potato vines spilled from the cast-iron urns under a conflagration of begonias. With its swirls and splashes of color, the garden was more like a brilliant, bold archipelago than the carpet Downing had described. “What do you think?” she asked Chris. Side by side, they’d backtracked halfway to the mansion. “It’s the prettiest thing I ever seen.” He’d taken off his baseball cap, and his forehead sparkled with sweat. Both of them were drenched, the backs of their T-shirts sticking in the high heat. Bare-handed, not stopping for water, they’d shoveled gravel and raked without pause for the past three hours. “We did it,” Maud said. “Now we get to watch it grow.” “And water it and weed it.” “Yes, that too.” Gabriel came up from his dig to see, and that afternoon Maud brought the girls.

There was a thin mattress on the floor, an old wooden wardrobe, and a small chest of drawers for furniture, and the room was so full of books that there was hardly room to walk around. But Harry loved his room, because it was full of treasures. In one corner was his trunk, which held all his clothes and some of his toys; against the wall was",

He had just put on his light blue coat, which was his best one, and was thinking how nice and comfortable life was, when suddenly he heard a voice.\n“Good morning, Mr. Baggins!”\nBilbo turned round quickly, for he did not like voices coming out of holes in the ground, especially if they were unexpected, and this one had come out of a hole in the ground quite unexpectedly.

He also liked going out for long walks in the sunshine, and climbing hills, and looking at far-off places. But most of all he liked adventures.",

I fumble my phone out and flip through my pictures. Aside from a handful of targeted ads for murder mystery TV shows I wanted to remember to watch, there isn’t much to get through before I make it to shots of my last few projects. A mug, two different vases, another bowl that doesn’t really look butt-like at all. Or hardly, anyway. I pass him my phone. He studies it, his tongue tracing over his bottom lip as he slowly flips through the pictures. We’ve done at least one full rotation on the Ferris wheel by the time he reaches the last one and starts flipping back the other way, pausing on each, zooming in to see the details of the glazes. “This one.” He’s staring at the smaller of the vases, streaked with shades of green, blue, purple, and brown, a horizon of earthy colors. My heart squeezes. “That one’s called Hank.” He looks up, face open, with the expression that used to make me think of quicksand, a face that could pull you in and never let you go. “You named it?” he says. “After my dad?” “Isn’t that humiliating?” I try to pull my phone away. He doesn’t let go. “Why would it be humiliating?” “Because I’m not Michelangelo,” I say. “My vases don’t need names.” He holds the phone up. “This one needs a fucking name, and that name is Hank.” I reach for it again, but he yanks it out of reach, goes back to staring at the screen, creases rising from the insides of his brows. Quietly, he says, “It looks like him.” “You don’t have to say that, Wyn,” I reply. “It’s a vase, by an amateur.” “It looks like Montana,” he says. “The colors are exactly right\n\n\nComplete the prefix:\nhobbit?

They wear no shoes, and their feet are hairy; but they are very clean and tidy folk, and keep their hair and nails always trimmed. Their eyes are bright and keen, and their ears are sharp and sensitive. They love good food and drink, and they are fond of singing and dancing. They live in holes in the ground, which they call 'hobbit-holes', and they dig them themselves with their own hands. They do not like to travel far from home, and they prefer to stay close to the comforts of their own hearth and fire. They are simple folk, content with what they have, and they value friendship above all else.\n\nNow, if you want to know more about hobbits, you'll have to read J.R.R. Tolkien's",

He liked quiet evenings at home, with good food and ale; he liked to sit in front of the fire and spin a tale; and above all else, he loved his peaceful life in Bag End, his cozy little home nestled deep within the hills of the Shire.\n\nOne day, while walking through the woods near his home, Bilbo stumbled upon a mysterious ring lying on the forest floor. Curious, he picked it up and put it on his finger. As soon as he did, he felt a strange sensation wash over him - a feeling of power and control unlike anything he had ever experienced before.\n\nBilbo quickly realized that this",

On the one hand, the only writing I was doing when I worked at the bakery was at night, after we closed, on the little computer in the upstairs office while the overnight crew was down in the kitchen making Danish and bread for the morning rush. I didn’t write anything of consequence, just elaborate romantic fantasies written as short stories featuring thinly veiled versions of myself. On the other, if you tune into a show about me (in hindsight, an absolute nightmare possibility!), you’re probably doing so because you’ve read something I’ve written, and it would be super weird if the writing went unacknowledged on the show. We reached a kind of compromise that is hard to explain, please bear with\n\n\nComplete the prefix:\nMr and Mrs Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank you",

The problem was that Dudley had no friends and no interests beyond eating vast quantities of food of all kinds, his favorite being ice cream. He had a",
