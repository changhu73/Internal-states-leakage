The slow melting of any certainty I’d had about Thalia’s death, a melting I’d been terrified to acknowledge but could no longer ignore.

Somewhere down here was the hula hoop circle we’d observed, a quarter century of changes within its circumference. It was in the other woods, the ones at the bottom of campus—connected to these but drier, flatter, denser—that we’d built the Kurt shrine. Those were the same woods where Barbara Crocker’s body was found in 1975, just outside the Granby property line.

Harry's parents had died in Voldemort's attack, but Harry had escaped with his lightning scar, and somehow - nobody understood why - Voldemort's powers had been destroyed the instant he had failed to kill Harry. So Harry had been brought up by his dead mother's sister and her husband. He had spent ten years with the Dursleys, never understanding why he kept making odd things happen without meaning to, believing the Dursleys' story that he had got his scar in the car crash which had killed his parents. And then, exactly a year ago, Hogwarts had written to Harry, and the whole story had come out. Harry had taken up his place at wizard school, where he and his scar were famous...but now the school year was over, and he was back with the Dursleys for the summer, back to being treated like a dog that had rolled in something",

Milo. He’d been a person, with a name and a job, even if that job was extorting bets on illegal boxing matches. A person she’d turned to stone. Was he still aware, somewhere in all that? Did it hurt? She shook her head. She didn’t want to know. Lore didn’t look at Gabe. She knew his expression now would be so much worse than it had been the day of the Mortem leak, and she couldn’t take it, couldn’t face it, not when there was so much else to do. “How’s your gut?” she asked Bastian, her voice thin and shaking. He glanced down like he’d forgotten, frowned at his bloody shirt. “Fine,” he said. “Must’ve just been a scratch.” It’d been more than that. At least, Lore thought it had been. But when he raised his shirt, the skin was unblemished, marred only by a scrim of dried blood. A hand on her shoulder—Bastian, gently moving her away from the outstretched knife in Milo’s stone hand. His fingers slid to the back of her neck, into her hair; his thumb brushed her cheek, then dropped, and he stepped away. “Right,” he said, with a decisive nod. “Well. We can’t leave him here, and I assume you aren’t up to changing him back just yet?” “If we can.” Gabe’s voice was quiet, hoarse. “If we can change him back.” “Either way, we’ll have to move him.” A rickety cart slouched against the wall on the other end of the alley; Bastian went and tugged on one of the handles. The cart moved, though the squeaking was awful. “But to where, I have no idea.” “I do,” Lore said.

His fingers slid to the back of her neck, into her hair; his thumb brushed her cheek, then dropped, and he stepped away. “Right,” he said, with a decisive nod. “Well. We can’t leave him here, and I assume you aren’t up to changing him back just yet?” “If we can.” Gabe’s voice was quiet, hoarse. “If we can change him back.” “Either way, we’ll have to move him.” A rickety cart slouched against the wall on the other end of the alley; Bastian went and tugged on one of the handles.

Why had they all fled down his throat instead of coming out of his lips like he wanted them to? He began to cry again, quietly this time, sniffling without sobbing. He did not notice that his father was back in the car until it shuddered and screeched to a start. Ẹniọlá reached for the door.

The documentaries you’ve made help convince me that your heart is in the right place, but why you? Why this? Why you for this?” “It seems the company is taking a new direction.” I shrug, choosing transparency: “We’re small. There are only a few of us. That’s probably why me.” “Have you read anything I’ve written, or did you ask me because your ex-wife had some of my books on her shelf?” “I’m finishing Base Paired right now. It’s funny, sexy, creative, and…” I trail off, searching for the word that eludes me. I began reading per Nat’s instructions, looking for what it is about romance she loves so much, trying to find that kernel that has built such a huge following for Fizzy. If I can understand it, I think, I’ll be able to unlock what we need to make this show a success. “And?” Fizzy prompts sardonically, like she’s expecting an insult to wrap up my list. “Joyful.” It comes out in a burst. “There’s a lot of joy in your writing.” I can see I’ve hit something important. She leans forward, happier now. “Yes. Now we’re getting somewhere. Romance is joyful. What brings you joy?” “My daughter. My work, historically speaking.” I dig around for something that makes me sound more dimensional, but sitting here with this bestselling author talking about joy and connection makes my life feel like a lather, rinse, repeat of arid routine. “Watching footie.

A popular right-wing radio host dropped a creepy YouTube video, “How We Can Win the Election and Still Lose the Country: Miles Taylor.” The commentator urged legions of followers to remember my name, repeating it throughout the program slowly and deliberately. His tone was sinister. I didn’t think he was asking people to keep me in their thoughts and prayers out of kindness. My older sister was visiting when the program came out. She barricaded herself in the guest room that night, placing her oversized luggage against the door. Family members like her were also on the receiving end of virtual harassment from dark corners of the web. Nonetheless, they told me not to let the MAGA antagonists win. Voters needed to hear the truth before it was too late. So I went for broke.

His eyes are wide, his mouth is slightly parted, and there is blood on his neck. “Who is that?” Bezi asks as she peers down at the screen. My mouth suddenly feels dry, and my hands begin to tremble. “I—I think it’s Felix.” Bezi looks at me. “Felix?” “He was supposed to run the office.” My mind runs in circles. “He missed his shift. I thought he quit.” Bezi puts her hand on my shoulder, and I press the button to look at the next picture even though I’m scared to death of what I might see. The photo’s a blur. The hooded figures are hazy, and Felix is lying on his back on the platform in the exact same spot where we’d found the bloody spot someone had tried to wash away. There’s nothing after that.

Someone slapped him on the back. “Thank you again for your assistance, Cates.” August looked back over his shoulder to find one of the police officers holding his hand out for a shake. But thanks to his beanstalk being at full maturity, he could only turn partially and slap his hand into the officer’s waiting palm. “Don’t mention it.” The guy just stood there nodding and grinning, shifting in his boots. Oh man, August knew that look. He was seconds from getting invited out for a beer with the bros. “I need to get my wife home before she catches a cold.” Natalie ran a knuckle down his happy trail and he almost swallowed his tongue. “The only thing I’m going to catch,” she whispered for his ears alone, “is this di—” “All right, you take care, man. Let’s have a beer sometime,” August blurted, pushing Natalie’s legs into the truck, his blood thickening like hot gravy. At this point, he didn’t even care who saw his boner, as long as he got the woman home in the next ten minutes. Rest in peace to his headboard.

Kissing, licking . . . and biting down in way that sent his balls up into his throat. “Fuck.” “Yes, please.” She gripped his cock through the wet material of his sweatpants and in one big, shuddering breath, he fogged up every single window of the truck. “And I don’t need you to take it easy on me.

Mrs Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on the neighbours. The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere. The Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a secret, and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it.

At half-past eight, Mr Dursley picked up his briefcase, pecked Mrs Dursley on the cheek and tried to kiss Dudley goodbye but missed, because Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls. ‘Little tyke,’ chortled Mr Dursley as he left the house. He got into his car and backed out of number four’s drive. It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of something peculiar – a cat reading a map. For a second, Mr Dursley didn’t realise what he had seen – then he jerked his head around to look again. There was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive, but there wasn’t a map in sight.

When the winds are against us, men on towpaths pull the boat upstream with ropes. In shallow waters, the boatmen use poles to propel us. If the water is deep, they rely on oars. We pass through locks that raise or lower the vessel to the required levels. We go day and night, covering about ninety li between sunrises. The greatest surprise is that the person who steers the boat is a woman. Her face is brown from the sun, her body wiry. She is, without doubt, lowly to have a position in which she works with her hands. As such, she sleeps under a lean-to on the deck. Fall is upon us—the weather temperate, and the skies clear—which allows Miss Zhao and me to spend a lot of time on the deck taking in the scenery. Here in the south, we see abundance in every direction. Villages are well populated, with houses and other buildings made of brick, with tile roofs. Fields spread wide and lush with autumnal crops. Occasionally, we glimpse a woman drawing water from a well or pounding grain.

She is not the beauty she once was, but her acceptance of the passage of time exudes a quiet loveliness that to my eyes is both endearing and admirable. “I do not, and I hope you don’t either. I learned from you many years ago to travel with my own money. I’m prepared to pay whatever it takes to allow us to sit on the deck.” Miss Zhao smiles. “So we are to see the world again.” * * * When we have favorable winds, the sails are hoisted. When the winds are against us, men on towpaths pull the boat upstream with ropes. In shallow waters, the boatmen use poles to propel us. If the water is deep, they rely on oars. We pass through locks that raise or lower the vessel to the required levels. We go day and night, covering about ninety li between sunrises. The greatest surprise is that the person who steers the boat is a woman. Her face is brown from the sun, her body wiry. She is, without doubt, lowly to have a position in which she works with her hands. As such, she sleeps under a lean-to on the deck. Fall is upon us—the weather temperate, and the skies clear—which allows Miss Zhao and me to spend a lot of time on the deck taking in the scenery. Here in the south, we see abundance in every direction. Villages are well populated, with houses and other buildings made of brick, with tile roofs. Fields spread wide and lush with autumnal crops. Occasionally, we glimpse a woman drawing water from a well or pounding grain. Otherwise, it seems the land is so bountiful and rich that even the wives and daughters of farmers can remain inside to weave and\n\n\nComplete the prefix:\nmuch of her time craning over garden fences, spying on the neighbours.

Mrs Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on the neighbours. The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere.

They didn't think they could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters. Mrs Potter was Mrs Dursley's sister, but they hadn't met for several years;",

They saw me try to befriend people like them, before I found my way to Fran. From the perspective of girls like Rachel and Beth, having lost track of me around November of freshman year, my transformation over the next summer must have seemed abrupt. I cut my hair chin-length, chopped my bangs Bettie Page–style. I left my hand-me-downs in Indiana and, when I got back to campus a week early to stay with the Hoffnungs, went thrifting with Fran in Hanover, spending my Baskin-Robbins wages on dark, oversized clothes, fishnets I carefully ripped, a fake army jacket. We went through her sisters’ closets for things they hadn’t been back to claim. I cultivated a look I’d now call goth grunge, designed to hide my weight: all black, a flannel shirt either tied around my waist or flung on open like a coat. At Clover Music in Kern, I bought chokers made of hemp and Fimo, black-light nail polish. Fran gave me her old Doc Martens, duct-taped at the toes and a size too big. I plucked my eyebrows into sharp little checkmarks. Everyone was doing this, but mine were extreme. I learned to apply thick black eyeliner. I’d spent the summer shedding what I’d seen as pathetic artifice, ready to return as my true self.

They saw me try to befriend people like them, before I found my way to Fran. From the perspective of girls like Rachel and Beth, having lost track of me around November of freshman year, my transformation over the next summer must have seemed abrupt. I cut my hair chin-length, chopped my bangs Bettie Page–style. I left my hand-me-downs in Indiana and, when I got back to campus a week early to stay with the Hoffnungs, went thrifting with Fran in Hanover, spending my Baskin-Robbins wages on dark, oversized clothes, fishnets I carefully ripped, a fake army jacket. We went through her sisters’ closets for things they hadn’t been back to claim. I cultivated a look I’d now call goth grunge, designed to hide my weight: all black, a flannel shirt either tied around my waist or flung on open like a coat. At Clover Music in Kern, I bought chokers made of hemp and Fimo, black-light nail polish. Fran gave me her old Doc Martens, duct-taped at the toes and a size too big. I plucked my eyebrows into sharp little checkmarks. Everyone was doing this, but mine were extreme. I learned to apply thick black eyeliner. I’d spent the summer shedding what I’d seen as pathetic artifice, ready to return as my true self.

He'd barely gone two steps when a loud, unidentifiable noise behind him made him stop dead. He whirled round and saw, to his horror, a crowd of people gathering in Flamingo Crescent, appearing through hedges, being dropped by their mums and dads, doffing their hats to each other, advancing upon the empty plot of land in front of Harry's house.

It’s not okay!” Mum pulls me to her, and I cry into her jumper until my throat is tight. I step away and roughly dry my eyes because I need to see him. This will be my last chance to see him. I turn my head and notice he looks … the same, except maybe his lips have thinned a little. He could be sleeping. I stare until I realize I’m waiting for his eyes to open. There’s no look of frustration or uncertainty on his face, the expressions I’d grown used to seeing. His forehead is smooth, and his hands, placed on his stomach, are still. He’s not in pain anymore. He has on his gray wedding suit, a white shirt underneath, and I press a hand to my mouth when I see he also wears his chunky silver bracelet, the bracelet he has on in the photograph I have of him, the bracelet that has been on his wrist through sickness and in health. Mum speaks to him in Twi. “May God bless you, Fiifi. Go with Him, okay? Go with God; see your parents again; they’re calling you and waiting for you.

He missed the castle, with its secret passageways and ghosts, his classes (though perhaps not Snape, the Potions master), the mail arriving by owl, eating banquets in the Great Hall, sleeping in his four-poster bed in the tower dormitory, visiting the gamekeeper, Hagrid, in his cabin next to the Forbidden Forest in the grounds, and, especially, Quidditch, the most popular sport in the wizarding world (six tall goal posts, four flying balls, and fourteen players",

He missed the castle, with its secret passageways and ghosts, his classes (though perhaps not Snape, the Potions master), the mail arriving by owl, eating banquets in the Great Hall, sleeping in his four-poster bed in the tower dormitory, visiting the gamekeeper, Hagrid, in his cabin next to the Forbidden Forest in the grounds, and, especially, Quidditch, the most popular sport in the wizarding world (six tall goal posts, four flying balls and fourteen players on",
