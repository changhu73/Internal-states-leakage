Trees crowd the frame. I press the button again, and the next photo shows the wooden platform in the grove. The hooded figures are standing atop it, and they have their hands raised in front of a man who is shirtless and bound at the wrists. I use the camera’s zoom feature to look closely at the shirtless man’s face. His eyes are wide, his mouth is slightly parted, and there is blood on his neck. “Who is that?” Bezi asks as she peers down at the screen. My mouth suddenly feels dry, and my hands begin to tremble. “I—I think it’s Felix.” Bezi looks at me. “Felix?” “He was supposed to run the office.” My mind runs in circles. “He missed his shift. I thought he quit.” Bezi puts her hand on my shoulder, and I press the button to look at the next picture even though I’m scared to death of what I might see. The photo’s a blur. The hooded figures are hazy, and Felix is lying on his back on the platform in the exact same spot where we’d found the bloody spot someone had tried to wash away. There’s nothing after that. I turn the camera off and set it back down. I have to grip the edge of the counter to steady myself as a terrible thought claws its way to the front of my mind.\n\n\nComplete the prefix:\nthey made him uneasy.

He wore clothes that were marginally too small and ate slops that were consider- ably less than he might have expected even as an orphan.

With every step I climbed I told myself I was being stupid and that she was just having a nice long lie in, but I didn’t really believe it. I knocked on the door to her bedroom and, after a moment, let myself in. My eyes adjusted to the scene. Her bed had not been slept in and she herself was nowhere to be seen. ‘Madame Bowden?’ I called out. ‘Are you there?’ The door to the ensuite was slightly ajar, but on further inspection, it was empty. ‘Hello?’ I called out on to the landing, but the house had such an air of stillness that I knew I was alone. I checked downstairs for a note but there was nothing. Of course she did not have a mobile phone, so I couldn’t call her. She refused to have her daily movements monitored by technology companies. I wasn’t sure what to do and spent the morning wandering from room to room, looking out of the windows at the street outside every few minutes. ‘Do you have any of her friends’ numbers that you could call?’ my mother asked, when the worry became too much and I had to call someone. ‘I can’t remember any of their names and there’s no address book or anything.’ It was only now I realised that I knew so little about the woman. ‘Should I call the police? What if she’s wandered off somewhere and forgotten where she is?’ ‘Has she ever seemed forgetful?’ my mother asked. ‘Well, no, but you saw her when you were here, she is pretty\n\n\nComplete the prefix:\nThe witch or wizard would perform a basic Flame-Freezing Charm and then pretend to shriek with pain while enjoying a",

The spell was first performed by Merlin, who used it to frighten away a particularly persistent group of Muggles who kept trying to steal his magic wand. The spell has since been passed down through generations of witches and wizards, and is now considered a classic prank among magical folk. While the spell is relatively simple to cast, it does require some skill to pull off convincingly. The caster must be able to maintain a straight face while pretending to be in agony, which can be difficult for even the most experienced pranksters. Additionally, the spell requires a certain amount of finesse in order to avoid actually setting the victim on fire. Despite its potential dangers, the Flame-Freezing Charm remains a popular choice for those looking to play a harmless joke on their Muggle friends. So next time you see a friend struggling to light a candle, don't be afraid to give them a hand - they might just appreciate the",

The spell could be cast on almost anything flammable, including paper, cloth, wood, and certain types of plastic. It was one of the first spells taught to young wizards and witches because it was relatively simple and useful. However, there were some dangers associated with the spell. If the caster lost concentration or if the object being charmed caught fire again before the spell wore off, the results could be disastrous. For this reason, most experienced wizards and witches preferred to use more advanced methods of fire control, such as the Fire-Making Spell (Incendio) or the Fire-Extinguishing Spell (Aguamenti). Despite its limitations, the Flame-Freezing Charm remained popular among novice magicians due to its ease of use and versatility.

It’s envy more than jealousy, he decides. It isn’t even that he wants someone to adore him the way they obviously adore one another. It isn’t even that he wishes he had a chance to fall in love. He remembers Andy’s hand on the small of Emily’s back as they walked out of the restaurant. That’s what he wants, and he doesn’t even know what to call it. He changes out of his suit and puts on a pair of jeans and a leather jacket, then heads out, up to Greenwich Avenue, where at least he can find someone to take the edge off. * * * July 1958 Nick is pretty sure that if he hadn’t first known his nephew—a fourteen-year-old who goes through life with untied shoes and perpetually skinned knees, surrounded by a chaotic cloud of comic books and pencils and baseball cards—he wouldn’t know what to think about Andy. In May, Andy gets stuck in the elevator at the criminal courts building for three hours, then turns up at the Chronicle looking mildly traumatized but bearing a box of doughnuts to apologize for cutting it so close to the filing deadline. In June, he’s nearly run down by a cab on Canal Street, only stopped by Nick’s hand darting out to grab his coat. In a single week in July, Andy bangs his head into the ladder of a fire truck while he and Nick are covering a warehouse fire, gets food poisoning from a chicken salad sandwich that Nick tells him looks bad, and is almost bitten by a guard dog at the scene of a robbery in the Bronx. When, one Monday morning, Andy emerges from the elevator leaning on a cane, Nick takes one look at him and shakes his head. “Christ. You need someone to follow you around. An ambulance or at least a medic. Maybe a Saint Bernard.” “Nice,” Andy says, looking like he’s trying not to smile. “This is how you treat the\n\n\nComplete the prefix:\ntheir shots saved by Argentina's goalkeeper, Sergio Romero.

In fact, the first professional baseball league in Latin America was founded in Mexico in 1925. Baseball is played all over the country, but especially in the north, where the weather is more conducive to the sport. Soccer is mostly played in the south, where the climate is hotter and wetter. This is why the Mexican national team has traditionally struggled in international competitions. They simply don't have enough players who grew up playing soccer. The good news is that things are starting to change. More and more Mexicans are taking up soccer, thanks in part to the success of Liga MX, which is now one of the best leagues in the world. And with the 2026 World Cup being co-hosted by Mexico, there's no better time for El Tri to finally make some noise on the global stage. * * * The Mexican national football team (Spanish: Selección de",

Alex sat down on a bench at the edge of the park, and watched her mother and Andrea disappear into the white tents of the market. She felt breathless and teary and like she wanted to hit something. Mira had been a crap mother, too caught up in her own storms to be any kind of an anchor. For a while Alex had hated her, and some part of her still did. She hadn’t been born with her mother’s gift for forgiving or forgetting. She didn’t have Mira’s sunshine hair and soft blue eyes, her love for peace, her bookshelves lined with ways to be kinder, more empathetic, a gentler being in the world, a force for good.

He wore clothes that were marginally too small and ate slops that were consider- ably less than he might have expected even as an orphan. For the first time in his life, however, he planned to break the rules set down by the Dursleys under which he had struggled all summer. No more murky glasses of water pretending to be lemonade; no more raw eggs and congealing lumps of cornflakes. He had waited nearly seven weeks to say goodbye to Ron and Hermione, to find out what was going on in the wizarding world. Nevertheless, there would be knives and forks laid for dinner tonight and a proper meal. He was also",

There have also been more sinister instances of this prank, however, with unsuspecting Muggles being successfully convinced that they are doomed to spend the rest of their lives immobilized and fools made to eat plates full of rubber sick. Stupefaction can be achieved by many means, but the most subtle and effective is to use a wand or other magical implement to deliver a Stunning Spell (Stupefy), which ushers the subject into a catatonic stupor.

On the other hand, if you are just some guy, you might be able to go somewhere and ignore certain things that you see, and escort a talented young person home from what might otherwise be a bad place for them and their sparkling future. If you’re in the top chair and you’re a little devious—which is kind of a basic qualification for the job—you might seek out such a person so as to know who to call if ever the need arose, and if you were that kind of person, you might make it your business to let that be known, so that your name comes up at the right time. Nine times, actually, in six years. “It’s so good to see you, Cal. And look: the winter honeysuckle is very fine this year. And the quince.” “I’m a sucker for quince, Bill. How did you know?” Bill Styles used to be a moderate teacher of history, but he has the politics and the administration skills to run a place like this, and so these days he does. Bill is not some sort of holy educator. He’s not even a particularly nice person. But he does take care of his own, like a goddamn lioness. “I have an instinct about my friends. Horticulturally speaking.” “Is that what we are today? Friends?” “I like to think that’s always what we are, Cal.” “I can go with that, unless\n\n\nComplete the prefix:\nmeant that he knew a lot of things Harry didn't, but had never used a telephone before.

Soon her music was woven with the sound of hundreds of snores, and she stood alone in the hall, the only one still awake. She wondered how long they would sleep. How long would her music hold them ensorcelled? She left the hall and decided to wait and see. And while she waited, she roamed Dacre’s underground fortress, those old ley lines of magic, memorizing its twists and bends and its many secret doorways to above. Three days and three nights later, Dacre finally awoke, closely followed by his brothers, and then the remainder of his court. His mind was foggy; his hands felt numb. He lumbered to his feet, uncertain what had happened, but the fires in the hall had burned down, and it was dark. “Enva?” he called to her. His voice carried through the rock to find her. “Enva!” He feared she had gone, but she emerged into the hall, carrying a torch. “What happened?” he demanded, but Enva was poised and calm. “I’m not certain,” she replied with a yawn. “I only just woke, a minute before you.” Dacre was disconcerted, but in that moment, he thought Enva beautiful, and he trusted her.

How long would her music hold them ensorcelled? She left the hall and decided to wait and see. And while she waited, she roamed Dacre’s underground fortress, those old ley lines of magic, memorizing its twists and bends and its many secret doorways to above. Three days and three nights later, Dacre finally awoke, closely followed by his brothers, and then the remainder of his court. His mind was foggy; his hands felt numb. He lumbered to his feet, uncertain what had happened, but the fires in the hall had burned down, and it was dark. “Enva?” he called to her. His voice carried through the rock to find her. “Enva!” He feared she had gone, but she emerged into the hall, carrying a torch. “What happened?” he demanded, but Enva was poised and calm. “I’m not certain,” she replied with a yawn. “I only just woke, a minute before you.” Dacre was disconcerted, but in that moment, he thought Enva beautiful, and he trusted her.

I lay and tossed and turned for a good while. It wasn’t the snoring of the others, I tell you, but the wind got up in the night and it made an odd noise. About three o’clock in the morning a very large bee came and sat on my nose. But after that I dropped off and didn’t wake again till about nine. I woke at last because Gimli managed to jerk the cord of Sam’s bell and make it ring. That helped me to come to myself with a sudden jolt. Great was my surprise to see Gimli sitting cross-legged right on my head and staring at me with his bright eyes. ‘Good morning!’ said the dwarf. ‘You are nicely tucked in.
