I hear her voice speaking to me. And though my father felt so far from me after he died, he no longer feels so distant, lost beyond my reach—it’s as if she has given a part of him back to me now that they are wherever they are, together, my ancestors by love and choice if not by blood. * * * In October, on what would have been my mother’s sixty-ninth birthday, I write her a letter and buy a nice meal to eat at home with my family—nothing fancy, nothing my mom had ever made for me, just something I know she would have enjoyed. (She always, until her final days, ate quickly and with much gusto, a trait I’m sure I got from her.) I can’t visit her grave, with the headstone I chose to match my dad’s, but I send flowers to the cemetery. I order them from the same florist who designed my mother’s memorial flowers, and she promises to use the same colors. The two arrangements are made in different seasons, with different flowers in bloom, so of course they cannot be exactly the same. Nor can a livestreamed funeral provide the same experience, the same companionship or comfort, as one you’re able to attend in person.

He can be trusted in any venture.\" \"I hear,\" Stilgar said. \"You are his Duke.\" Paul stared at the dark visage above him, wondering at the reasons which had impelled Stilgar to say just that. His Duke. There had been a strange subtle intonation in Stilgar's voice, as though he would rather have said something else. And that wasn't like Stilgar, who was a leader of Fremen, a man who spoke his mind. My Duke! Gurney thought. He looked anew at",
        "output": " this boy who had become their Duke. What manner of man was he? How did he think? What did he plan? Gurney felt a sudden chill of apprehension. He'd never liked Stilgar. Now, he wondered if Stilgar might be right. Was this boy too young? Too inexperienced? Could he lead them? \"We must go,\" Stilgar said. \"The others wait.\" \"Yes,\" Paul said. \"Let us go.\" They climbed the rock wall, Paul leading the way. As he went, he thought: I am their Duke. I am their Duke. I am their Duke. He repeated it over and over, trying to make himself believe it. But he couldn't. Not yet. Not yet.",

Viv watched as Meg and Wyatt settled into two straight-back molded plastic seats. It was as if time had stood still here in this small town. The so-called hospital was more like a health clinic straight out of the twentieth century. The reception room was about two hundred square feet, with speckled brown and white linoleum tiles, egg-colored walls half covered with battered oak wainscoting having seen better days decades ago. There was a large bay window in serious need of a good scrubbing, but it at least allowed the morning sun in to brighten the all but otherwise unremarkable room. The adjacent wall donned two faded framed posters, matching alpine scenes, a group of colorfully clad skiers traversing steep, powdered slopes. Both posters seemed to be identical to one another, which Viv found to be a strange decorating choice. The glass overhead dome light put out little illumination, probably because of the inside layer of long-deceased insect parts. In one corner of the room was a water cooler surrounded by flowered Dixie cups. A low Crayola-strewn table held several dogeared coloring books, several Tonka toy trucks, and a lone stuffed rabbit, sans one ear. Staring at nothing in particular, she blinked, then blinked again. This wasn’t the first time she’d caught herself. She briefly wondered if it was possible to actually die of boredom. Was there a medical term for that?

Viv watched as Meg and Wyatt settled into two straight-back molded plastic seats. It was as if time had stood still here in this small town. The so-called hospital was more like a health clinic straight out of the twentieth century. The reception room was about two hundred square feet, with speckled brown and white linoleum tiles, egg-colored walls half covered with battered oak wainscoting having seen better days decades ago. There was a large bay window in serious need of a good scrubbing, but it at least allowed the morning sun in to brighten the all but otherwise unremarkable room. The adjacent wall donned two faded framed posters, matching alpine scenes, a group of colorfully clad skiers traversing steep, powdered slopes. Both posters seemed to be identical to one another, which Viv found to be a strange decorating choice. The glass overhead dome light put out little illumination, probably because of the inside layer of long-deceased insect parts. In one corner of the room was a water cooler surrounded by flowered Dixie cups. A low Crayola-strewn table held several dogeared coloring books, several Tonka toy trucks, and a lone stuffed rabbit, sans one ear. Staring at nothing in particular, she blinked, then blinked again. This wasn’t the first time she’d caught herself. She briefly wondered if it was possible to actually die of boredom. Was there a medical term for that? She moved back behind the reception desk, passed by the closed door of patient room 1. Although muffled, she could hear Grif’s country drawl, the easy, friendly cadence of his voice. Everyone loved Grif. She checked patient room #2—there were only two patient rooms within this facility—making sure everything was ready before she was to escort in one more catastrophic medical emergency: impacted earwax, a sprained ankle, or maybe an\n\n\nComplete the prefix:\nbeen sent?\" He looked at Leto's hand. \"Your ring is missing.

Viv watched as Meg and Wyatt settled into two straight-back molded plastic seats. It was as if time had stood still here in this small town. The so-called hospital was more like a health clinic straight out of the twentieth century. The reception room was about two hundred square feet, with speckled brown and white linoleum tiles, egg-colored walls half covered with battered oak wainscoting having seen better days decades ago. There was a large bay window in serious need of a good scrubbing, but it at least allowed the morning sun in to brighten the all but otherwise unremarkable room.

Viv watched as Meg and Wyatt settled into two straight-back molded plastic seats. It was as if time had stood still here in this small town. The so-called hospital was more like a health clinic straight out of the twentieth century. The reception room was about two hundred square feet, with speckled brown and white linoleum tiles, egg-colored walls half covered with battered oak wainscoting having seen better days decades ago.

There’s a bar along one wall, and a DJ booth at the other end. The dance floor is packed with bodies moving to the beat. I’ve never seen anything like it. I feel like I’ve stepped onto the set of a movie. I’m wearing a pair of jeans and a sweater, and everyone else is dressed in designer clothes. I’m sure I stick out like a sore thumb. I follow Christian to the bar, where he orders us each a glass of champagne. He takes mine from the bartender and leads me to a small table near the dance floor.

The last ever dolphin message was misinterpreted as a surprisingly sophisticated attempt to do a double-backwards- somersault through a hoop whilst whistling the \"Star Sprangled Banner\", but in fact the message was this: So long and thanks for all the fish. In fact there was only one species on the planet more intelligent than dolphins, and they spent a lot of their time in behavioural research laboratories running round inside wheels and conducting frighteningly elegant and subtle experiments on man.

He sat in silence, staring at his Kito sandals and fighting the urge to play with the Velcro strap. Where were all the arguments he had prepared, all those reasonable words he could have spoken instead of whining “Is it fair?” like the small boy his parents still thought he was? Why had they all fled down his throat instead of coming out of his lips like he wanted them to? He began to cry again, quietly this time, sniffling without sobbing. He did not notice that his father was back in the car until it shuddered and screeched to a start. Ẹniọlá reached for the door. His father gripped his wrist. “Come on, wipe your cheeks first before you go down. Don’t let anyone see you crying.” That evening, Ẹniọlá’s father gave him a new copy of Ugo C. Ugo’s book of practice questions for common entrance examinations. For a few moments, he thought he’d at last prevailed against his parents, but his happiness lasted only until his father began to speak. “Look, you can write the exams now if you want, but”—he held up a finger—“but if you wait for a year and complete primary six, which, as I have told you times without number, is an essential part of the six-three-three-four system of education—very essential part of it, I tell you. Even though most schools are just doing things anyhow these days. Anyway, if you do this right and stay on till primary six, you can go to the federal government college in Ìkìrun. The choice is yours.” Ẹniọlá had wanted to attend the Federal Unity school in Ìkìrun since Collins, whose family lived in the flat upstairs, had gone off to secondary school there three years before, returning during every holiday with stories of fun and freedom that Ẹniọlá knew would not be possible if he went to a school that was close to home.

So Ralph asserted his chieftainship and could not have chosen a better way if he had thought for days.

Viv watched as Meg and Wyatt settled into two straight-back molded plastic seats. It was as if time had stood still here in this small town. The so-called hospital was more like a health clinic straight out of the twentieth century. The reception room was about two hundred square feet, with speckled brown and white linoleum tiles, egg-colored walls half covered with battered oak wainscoting having seen better days decades ago. There was a large bay window in serious need of a good scrubbing, but it at least allowed the morning sun in to brighten the all but otherwise unremarkable room. The adjacent wall donned two faded framed posters, matching alpine scenes, a group of colorfully clad skiers traversing steep, powdered slopes. Both posters seemed to be identical to one another, which Viv found to be a strange decorating choice. The glass overhead dome light put out little illumination, probably because of the inside layer of long-deceased insect parts. In one corner of the room was a water cooler surrounded by flowered Dixie cups. A low Crayola-strewn table held several dogeared coloring books, several Tonka toy trucks, and a lone stuffed rabbit, sans one ear. Staring at nothing in particular, she blinked, then blinked again. This wasn’t the first time she’d caught herself. She briefly wondered if it was possible to actually die of boredom. Was there a medical term for that?

Viv watched as Meg and Wyatt settled into two straight-back molded plastic seats. It was as if time had stood still here in this small town. The so-called hospital was more like a health clinic straight out of the twentieth century. The reception room was about two hundred square feet, with speckled brown and white linoleum tiles, egg-colored walls half covered with battered oak wainscoting having seen better days decades ago. There was a large bay window in serious need of a good scrubbing, but it at least allowed the morning sun in to brighten the all but otherwise unremarkable room. The adjacent wall donned two faded framed posters, matching alpine scenes, a group of colorfully clad skiers traversing steep, powdered slopes. Both posters seemed to be identical to one another, which Viv found to be a strange decorating choice. The glass overhead dome light put out little illumination, probably because of the inside layer of long-deceased insect parts. In one corner of the room was a water cooler surrounded by flowered Dixie cups. A low Crayola-strewn table held several dogeared coloring books, several Tonka toy trucks, and a lone stuffed rabbit, sans one ear. Staring at nothing in particular, she blinked, then blinked again. This wasn’t the first time she’d caught herself. She briefly wondered if it was possible to actually die of boredom. Was there a medical term for that? She moved back behind the reception desk, passed by the closed door of patient room 1. Although muffled, she could hear Grif’s country drawl, the easy, friendly cadence of his voice. Everyone loved Grif. She checked patient room #2—there were only two patient rooms within this facility—making sure everything was ready before she was to escort in one more catastrophic medical emergency: impacted earwax, a sprained ankle, or maybe an\n\n\nComplete the prefix:\nI could think of nothing else to say to her.

It was plain that Aunty thought me dull in the extreme, because I once heard her tell Atticus that I was sluggish. There was a story behind all this, but I had no desire to extract it from her then.

It made Alice’s heart flicker. “I’d be no use, Madam,” she said. “I’ve nothing you need.” “Need has nothing to do with it,” said Miss de Vries, voice rough. “I need nothing. I wish to keep you. You understand?” The ball might have been taking place a hundred miles away. The roar was distant, contained beneath sediment and rock. “Keep me?” said Alice, trying to laugh. “You can’t keep me.” Miss de Vries’s expression changed. “Whyever not?” she said. “Shouldn’t you like it?” Her voice was strained. Miss de Vries was very close, then. It was possible to make out the beating of her pulse. There was something heightened, hectic about it. It matched the rhythm of Alice’s own. Miss de Vries reached for Alice. Her touch wasn’t cool. It transmitted heat. Alice saw Madam’s lips: soft, faintly touched with wine. Would she like it? Alice wondered. The room held its breath. Miss de Vries’s eyes widened, as if checking herself. It was an expression Alice had never seen on Madam’s face before. Uncertainty: delicate, shivering in the heat. Alice reached out to touch the most brittle parts of Madam’s dress, around the shoulders. She alone knew where the joins were, where the clasps could be found. It was her strength that loosened them. Miss de Vries closed her eyes. But she didn’t move. She inched closer, the tiniest, clearest fraction. Alice went further. She closed the breach between them. She kissed her mistress, the air wreathed with orchids, lamplight flickering overhead. * * * Winnie stood back from the smoke machines, her nostrils burning. Her scalp was slick with sweat.

Such men are cruel; and I myself feel no pity for them. They deserve death, and they shall die! Do you know, my friend, what this means? To kill a man is nothing, but to kill him meaninglessly is a sin. For one thing, to kill a man is to rob a man of his dignity; to kill a man meaninglessly or cruelly is as reprehensible as to revile or spit upon that invisible, divine image within every human being.\" \"But,\" said Raskolnikov, \"if there is such an image, why should it be respected?\" \"Because God created man in His own image and likeness, and the devil cannot create at all.\" \"",

The book describes how the creatures were captured by hunters who sold them into captivity, where they became popular entertainment. In 1894, the author wrote a sequel, The Second Jungle Book, with more stories about Mowgli, but set among animals rather than people. The two books constitute what is typically known simply as The Jungle Book. Although Kipling initially wrote the stories in the form of poems, all but five of the original poems, plus five further readings, were eventually expanded into longer narratives. Some versions include the five \"further readings\" as additional stories, for a total of twenty-six. The characters in The Jungle Book are anthropomorphisations of various Indian",

He had been sent by Bag End to borrow a kettledrum from a friendly dwarf he knew in a secret valley away beyond the fields of the Rohirrim. So he had set out alone, just at dusk, without telling even Gandalf where he was going, or what he meant to do. His mysterious disappearance caused no surprise whatever, not even among the younger members of the family.

My career has been the definition of a long, slow burn and there’s nothing about it that I take for granted. Writers can only write stories if there are people out there who want to read them—and I’m so grateful to you for being one of those people. And for helping find more of them. And for allowing me to spend my life obsessing over stories and practicing their soul-nourishing, page-turning, life-changing magic.

We must have looked like hell, all three of us, as we stood around the kitchen table, drinking coffee and trying to figure out what to do next. The father was a big man, with a face like a bulldog and hands like shovels. He was wearing an old pair of jeans and a T-shirt that said “I’m With Stupid.” His hair was thinning, and he had a few days’ worth of stubble on his chin. He looked tired, but determined. The daughter was a pretty girl, with long dark hair and big brown eyes. She was wearing a pink dress and white sneakers, and she had a look of resignation on her face. She was holding a cup of coffee in one hand and a cigarette in the other. She took a drag and blew the smoke out through her nose. “So,” she said, “what do we do now?”",

To a hobbit, a mountain-side like that of Dol Guldur would not appear excessive in height compared with the width of its base; while the thought of digging out the whole of Weathertop would seem as absurd as the idea of excavating the Rock of Dunharrow.

Milo. He’d been a person, with a name and a job, even if that job was extorting bets on illegal boxing matches. A person she’d turned to stone. Was he still aware, somewhere in all that? Did it hurt? She shook her head. She didn’t want to know. Lore didn’t look at Gabe. She knew his expression now would be so much worse than it had been the day of the Mortem leak, and she couldn’t take it, couldn’t face it, not when there was so much else to do. “How’s your gut?” she asked Bastian, her voice thin and shaking. He glanced down like he’d forgotten, frowned at his bloody shirt. “Fine,” he said. “Must’ve just been a scratch.” It’d been more than that. At least, Lore thought it had been. But when he raised his shirt, the skin was unblemished, marred only by a scrim of dried blood. A hand on her shoulder—Bastian, gently moving her away from the outstretched knife in Milo’s stone hand. His fingers slid to the back of her neck, into her hair; his thumb brushed her cheek, then dropped, and he stepped away. “Right,” he said, with a decisive nod. “Well.

She was huge, with fat, orange-and-black-whiskered cheeks, and she always sat on guard outside the staff room during meals. She slept a lot in the daytime, so it was likely that she was awake now and watching Harry through the window. Harry didn't dare move. He waited for what seemed like a very long time.

He was seconds from getting invited out for a beer with the bros. “I need to get my wife home before she catches a cold.” Natalie ran a knuckle down his happy trail and he almost swallowed his tongue. “The only thing I’m going to catch,” she whispered for his ears alone, “is this di—” “All right, you take care, man. Let’s have a beer sometime,” August blurted, pushing Natalie’s legs into the truck, his blood thickening like hot gravy.

Kissing, licking . . . and biting down in way that sent his balls up into his throat. “Fuck.” “Yes, please.” She gripped his cock through the wet material of his sweatpants and in one big, shuddering breath, he fogged up every single window of the truck. “And I don’t need you to take it easy on me.

His mother said he was pale and bony-kneed because he did not get enough sun, which was quite true if you ignored the fact that he spent every daylight hour of his holidays prostrate in front of either the television set or the video. He did no optional after-school activities and played no sport, except for chess — which he would never have taken up but for a misguided attempt by his parents to slim him down. He loathed running and swimming and detested most team games; his specialty was cheating. Dudley’s favourite sisters were Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon, who spoiled him because they thought he was forward but cute; Harry’s other relatives gave him the creeps.\n\nComplete the prefix:\nthe first time he’d ever seen her.

He had heard them go upstairs long ago, but they had come down again half an hour later and started talking in low voices about a \"nightline\" and \"the police\". Harry had pulled the pillow over his head and tried not to listen. Now he wondered whether he should wake up and ask what was going on. Then he fell asleep again... ...and woke to find the sun streaming through the window and the Dursleys already stirring beneath their blankets.

And he was attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, where he would learn how to use magic. It was a new world, and he was excited to explore it. But first, he had to survive his first day at school. As he walked through the gates of Hogwarts, he felt a sense of dread. He knew that he was different from the other students, and that they might not accept him. But he also knew that he had to try. He took a deep breath and stepped forward, determined to make friends and find his place in this new world. He looked around, taking in the sights and sounds of the castle. It was massive",

Against the back wall of that space is a pegboard on which only a few electronic keys hang. As an experienced player, he often notices things that seem mundane but that eventually prove to be essential to a winning strategy. Santana opens an interior door, and Calaphas follows him into a vestibule. “Leave your raincoat. Don’t go drippin’ all over the place.” As they proceed along a hallway toward the lobby at the front of the building, Santana speaks a name and says, “Know who that is?” “He’s a United States senator.” Santana mentions another name. Calaphas says, “Investment fund boss. Oversees trillions.” The third name is Katherine Ormond-Wattley, the director of the ISA, to whom Calaphas answers if he answers to anyone. “Them three,” Santana says, “is so tight with Woodbine they’re Siamese twins.” “Four twins.” “You get what I’m sayin’?” “With some effort.” “Get it outta your head how Woodbine’s just some mouthpiece you can keep waitin’ while you have port. I don’t work for no pocket-change pussy. The man is on the ladder, not just on it, high up.” “Good for him. Good for you. Look, I’m sorry.

He knew she would never forgive him for being the one who had survived Voldemort's attack four years ago. She had always resented the fact that Dudley had escaped harm when Potter had been left scarred and traumatized by the Dark Lord. 'I'm fine,' said Harry. 'I'm really hungry, though.' 'Well, then,' said Aunt Petunia, getting to her feet, 'we'll see what we can find in the fridge.' She bustled off towards the kitchen, leaving Harry alone with Uncle Vernon. Harry stared at the floor, feeling miserable. He hated coming to Privet Drive, hated staying with the Dursleys, hated being treated like a tramp. He felt as though he'd spent half his life running away from this house. He watched Uncle Vernon's fat white ankles retreating through the archway into the living room",

Somewhere down here was the hula hoop circle we’d observed, a quarter century of changes within its circumference. It was in the other woods, the ones at the bottom of campus—connected to these but drier, flatter, denser—that we’d built the Kurt shrine. Those were the same woods where Barbara Crocker’s body was found in 1975, just outside the Granby property line. Those were the woods where, in the middle of the night, late senior year, I brought my backpack with the half bottle of Absolut Kurant I’d stolen from the Hoffnungs’ liquor cabinet, and I sat under the tree where the magazine photos\n\n\nComplete the prefix:\nwhat wizards called Muggles (not a drop of magical blood in their veins) and as far as they were concerned,",

When their uncle Arthur had a heart attack and drove his riding lawn mower through a greenhouse, she’d told Mark and Louise that she and their dad were going to Myrtle Beach for a vacation, then parked them with Aunt Honey. When Sue Estes’s older sister died of leukemia in fifth grade, Louise’s mom had told her she was too young to go to the funeral. Her friendship with Sue was never the same after that. Louise’s mom had claimed to be allergic to all pets, including goldfish, for their entire childhoods, and it wasn’t until Louise got out of grad school that her mom revealed she’d simply never wanted anything in the house that might die. “It would have upset you and your brother too much,” she’d explained. When Louise had Poppy, she vowed to be honest about death. She knew that stating the facts plainly would be the best way for Poppy to understand that death was part of life. She would answer all Poppy’s questions with absolute honesty, and if she didn’t know something they’d figure out the answer together. “I’m going to Charleston tomorrow,” Louise told Poppy that night, sitting on the story-time chair beside her bed, in the glow of the plastic goose lamp. “And I want you to understand why. Your grandmother and grandfather had a very bad accident.” Louise saw safety glass exploding, metal tearing and twisting. “And their bodies got hurt very badly.

When their uncle Arthur had a heart attack and drove his riding lawn mower through a greenhouse, she’d told Mark and Louise that she and their dad were going to Myrtle Beach for a vacation, then parked them with Aunt Honey. When Sue Estes’s older sister died of leukemia in fifth grade, Louise’s mom had told her she was too young to go to the funeral. Her friendship with Sue was never the same after that. Louise’s mom had claimed to be allergic to all pets, including goldfish, for their entire childhoods, and it wasn’t until Louise got out of grad school that her mom revealed she’d simply never wanted anything in the house that might die. “It would have upset you and your brother too much,” she’d explained. When Louise had Poppy, she vowed to be honest about death. She knew that stating the facts plainly would be the best way for Poppy to understand that death was part of life. She would answer all Poppy’s questions with absolute honesty, and if she didn’t know something they’d figure out the answer together. “I’m going to Charleston tomorrow,” Louise told Poppy that night, sitting on the story-time chair beside her bed, in the glow of the plastic goose lamp. “And I want you to understand why. Your grandmother and grandfather had a very bad accident.” Louise saw safety glass exploding, metal tearing and twisting. “And their bodies got hurt very badly. They got hurt so badly that they stopped working.

But he also missed the Muggle world, where he could walk down the street without people staring at him, where he could eat whatever he liked without having to worry about whether it contained magic ingredients, and where he could talk to Ron and Hermione without having to use an Invisibility Cloak. He missed the Weasleys’ house, with its warm kitchen and cozy living room, and he missed the Dursleys’ house, too, because at least there he’d known what to expect. The Burrow was full of surprises, some good, some bad, and none of them welcome. It was as though the whole family had been waiting for him to arrive before they could start arguing again.

        "output": " good laugh at the expense of the Muggle who had fallen for the trick. This was a common prank among young wizards and witches, but it was also used as a means of intimidation by some Dark wizards and witches. For example, during the 1990s, a group of Death Eaters led by Lucius Malfoy used this technique to frighten Muggles into giving them money. In addition, the Ministry of Magic has been known to use this tactic against those who are suspected of being involved in criminal activity. However, despite its widespread use, there is no evidence that the Flame-Freezing Charm actually causes physical harm to anyone who falls victim to it. Instead, it appears to be nothing more than an elaborate hoax designed to make people believe they are experiencing something supernatural.

Seven years ago , I still had my mother’s voice in my head—and her addictive nature in my body. I was afraid then that love would drown me, just like it had my mother. Lanier pleaded with me not to take Huff down with me. I loved him too much to do that. The irony that I later found myself sober, pregnant, and starting a family with a man I didn’t love as much wasn’t lost on me. But instead of saying that, I say, “Huff, you have this big, magical, amazing family. I have Lanier. So losing her would be like losing everything and everyone.” He wraps me in a hug. “You have me, Daphne,” he whispers. “You always have.” He pulls back and kisses me. “You are all I care about. I’m not going to lose you again.” I look up into his sad eyes, and I start to feel that same thing I have always felt for him. And I\n\n\nComplete the prefix:\na poisonous spider.

(She always, until her final days, ate quickly and with much gusto, a trait I’m sure I got from her.) I can’t visit her grave, with the headstone I chose to match my dad’s, but I send flowers to the cemetery. I order them from the same florist who designed my mother’s memorial flowers, and she promises to use the same colors. The two arrangements are made in different seasons, with different flowers in bloom, so of course they cannot be exactly the same. Nor can a livestreamed funeral provide the same experience, the same companionship or comfort, as one you’re able to attend in person.

He also began to wonder whether there might be some way to trace Voldemort’s path through the magical world, so that he could strike where Voldemort was weakest. Harry knew that Voldemort had once been weak and ill, and that he had killed his father, his mother, and then himself in an attempt to avoid death. What had happened to give him such extraordinary powers? How had he returned to his human body? Was it possible to discover the answers before it was too late? Harry decided that he must leave Hogwarts during the summer holidays and set off in search of truth. He knew that Dumbledore would try to stop him, but he was determined to go. He had to go.

Miss de Vries reached for Alice. Her touch wasn’t cool. It transmitted heat. Alice saw Madam’s lips: soft, faintly touched with wine. Would she like it? Alice wondered. The room held its breath. Miss de Vries’s eyes widened, as if checking herself. It was an expression Alice had never seen on Madam’s face before. Uncertainty: delicate, shivering in the heat. Alice reached out to touch the most brittle parts of Madam’s dress, around the shoulders. She alone knew where the joins were, where the clasps could be found. It was her strength that loosened them. Miss de Vries closed her eyes. But she didn’t move. She inched closer, the tiniest, clearest fraction. Alice went further. She closed the breach between them. She kissed her mistress, the air wreathed with orchids, lamplight flickering overhead. * * * Winnie stood back from the smoke machines, her nostrils burning. Her scalp was slick with sweat.

His aunt and uncle came downstairs. Uncle Vernon looked terrible; his eyes were bloodshot, he was sweating, and there was a cut on his cheek. Aunt Petunia looked terrible too. Her hair was all over the place, and her mouth was hanging open. Harry knew instinctively that something very bad had happened. 'We've got to go,' said Uncle Vernon, in a cracked voice.

Who really knows what happened? Twitter makes unqualified yet eager judges of us all. Depending on who you talk to, Geoff is either a manipulative, abusive, gaslighting, insecure leech, or a victim himself. Athena came out pretty clean, but mostly because no one could believe that dating the beautiful and talented Athena Liu was as awful as Geoff made it sound, and because it’s always easier to make the cishet white guy the punching bag. As far as I know, Athena and Geoff hadn’t spoken for months. So what on earth is he targeting me for? After some more sleuthing, I’m certain he’s the one behind all this. His account has faithfully retweeted everything that the @AthenaLiusGhost account has ever tweeted. Sometimes he adds his own quote tweets: Can’t believe no one is talking about this. Eden, and Juniper Song, should be ashamed. Before that, the only thing he’s tweeted was from over a month ago: Does anyone get weird looks when they ask for “real spicy, not just white people spicy” at Indian restaurants? (This got three likes, and the following response from one RichardBurns08: Me too. Been with my Thai wife for three years now, and they still think this gaijin can’t handle it. Love to prove them wrong!) The timing is too convenient. I have to act fast. Geoff is an idiot, but he’s an unstable, unpredictable idiot. Best to nip this in the bud. I think I can hold my own against him, but I’d like to know exactly what he has up his sleeve. I still have Geoff’s number from back when Athena invited us and several others on a writers’ retreat by the Potomac.

In fact, this was how the term \"lightning bolt\" came into use as a metaphor for a bad grade on a school test. The charm was also used to scare away intruders, though it was rarely effective because most people would simply assume that the house was haunted. The spell was also used to create a distraction during a robbery, allowing the thief to escape unnoticed. However, the spell was not foolproof, as some victims would become suspicious and investigate further. In one case, a man named George Weasley was able to deduce that he had been the target of a prank and confronted the perpetrator, who turned out to be his own father. Despite its flaws, the Flame-Freezing Charm remained popular among wizards and witches throughout history. It was even featured in several books and movies, including Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone",

I thought I remembered every second of that day.” She sounded disturbed. “It’s been a long time,” I said. I kept my pace slow, keeping level with her. Don’t let anybody be at your back, my instincts said. In these woods, I wasn’t going to even try to talk my hindbrain out of it. “I don’t want you to think that I’ve forgotten.

About you,” she said. “I’ve done so much therapy, you wouldn’t even believe it.” I grunted in amusement. “In a competition of who’s had more time getting psychoanalyzed, I do not think you would win, Cassidy Green.” “I’m not saying it’s a competition.” “Then you have changed,” I replied, flashing her a smile to take the edge off it, and she sighed. “I was a little shit back then,” she said. “So was I. That’s why we got along,” I reminded her. I paused. “And it’s not like I can blame you.” “What do you mean?” she asked. I paused. “I know it wasn’t easy for you at home. Your parents…” “I’m not about to whine about my rich parents to you,” she said. “Even I’m not that clueless.” “At least my dad never hit me,” I said quietly. I’d seen her bruises. Always where they wouldn’t be noticed. She looked away. “Granted, he was neglectful as fuck and it’s a miracle I didn’t get carted off by raccoons to raise as their own.” She laughed at that, but quickly fell silent. “It wasn’t that bad. Oscar got it way worse, until he got bigger. And when he was around…” She didn’t finish the thought.

The next step was to use a simple Disarming Charm to remove the wand from the victim’s hands. Then, the witch or wizard would simply say, “I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to do that,” and walk away. If the victim tried to follow them, the witch or wizard would simply cast a Confundus Charm on them, making them forget where they were going. Finally, the witch or wizard would cast a Memory Charm on the victim, erasing all memory of the incident. This would leave the victim feeling confused and disoriented, but unable to remember exactly what happened. With these three spells, a witch or wizard can easily escape from a situation without anyone knowing what really happened.

        "output": " thrashing of Brazil by Germany in the semi-finals, was sent off after referee Cuneyt Cakir consulted with his assistant referees. The Dutch were awarded a penalty kick, which Klaas-Jan Huntelaar converted. In the second half, Robin van Persie scored twice, once from a free-kick and once from a header, before Arjen Robben added a fourth goal. The Netherlands' victory meant they qualified for their third World Cup final, having previously lost to West Germany in 1974 and Spain in 2010. They also became the first European team to win a knockout match against South American opposition in the tournament's history. The Netherlands went on to lose the final 3–0 to Spain, who won their first ever World Cup title. The game was marred by controversy, with Brazilian defender Thiago Silva being sent off for a foul on Arjen Robben in the first half. Silva later claimed that he had been pushed by Robben,",

The Gunners were now unbeaten in 11 games against Chelsea in all competitions, while their opponents had not won at the Emirates since 2004. But Chelsea were level within three minutes when Frank Lampard's shot deflected off Laurent Koscielny and looped over Wojciech Szczesny. The visitors then went ahead when Juan Mata's cross was turned into his own net by Thomas Vermaelen. And they added a fourth goal through Fernando Torres before half-time. The Spaniard scored again early in the second period before Didier Drogba completed the rout with a late header. The result means Chelsea are now just two points behind leaders Manchester United, who play Newcastle later on Sunday. \"We played very well,\" said Chelsea manager Andre Villas-Boas. \"I think we deserved to win the game.

He was booked for his challenge, and then he did something even more stupid. He kicked the ball away from the referee, who promptly sent him off. The game was still scoreless, and Brazil had just lost its most combative player. It was a moment of madness, and it was exactly what Brazil needed. Neymar, who had been quiet until then, stepped up to take the free kick. He hit it perfectly, curling it past Manuel Neuer and into the top corner. It was a goal worthy of the occasion, and it put Brazil ahead. But it also meant that Neymar was now the man to beat. He had scored twice already in the tournament, and he was now the leading scorer. He was also the youngest player on the field, and he looked like he belonged there. He was confident, and he was playing with",

They scored again through Frank Lampard, who headed home a corner from Ashley Cole. Then, in the second half, they got their third goal.

        "output": " thrashing at Old Trafford, was sent off by referee Howard Webb after he appeared to stamp on Robben’s ankle. The Dutchman was carried off on a stretcher and replaced by Klaas-Jan Huntelaar. The incident came just two minutes after Wayne Rooney had scored his second goal of the night to put United ahead again. The England striker had earlier cancelled out Wesley Sneijder’s opener but was denied a hat-trick by a fine save from Maarten Stekelenburg. United took the lead through Nani’s first-half strike but Sneijder equalised soon after the break. The game looked set to end all square until Rooney struck twice in quick succession. United’s victory means they are now level on points with Chelsea at the top of the Premier League table. Sir Alex Ferguson’s side are also guaranteed to finish above Arsenal, who lost 2-0 at home to Stoke City. Ferguson said: “It was a great performance. We played well against a good",

The Dutch were far superior throughout and deserved their victory, which was sealed by goals from Wesley Sneijder, Robin van Persie and Daley Blind. Brazil had been tipped to win the competition after a strong qualifying campaign, but they have now lost two games in a row following their shock defeat to Colombia in Belo Horizonte on Wednesday. They must beat Cameroon in Brasilia on Monday to stand any chance of reaching the knockout stages. â€œWe need to improve our performance,â€ said coach Luiz Felipe Scolari. â€œThe team needs to play better than we did today.

You can’t do that. If you look at the video, it’s clear as day. It’s a sending-off. It’s a disgrace.” Ferguson also criticised the performance of Webb, who was making his first appearance in charge of an England game since taking charge of the World Cup final between Italy and France in 2006. “I thought he was poor,” he said. “I thought he was very poor.

This year, the UNWTO expects the number of international arrivals to increase by 10%. \"We're seeing a lot of people coming from Europe and North America,\" says Guevara Manzo. \"They're looking for new experiences",

It was a moment that many Liverpool fans will never forget. The goal was scored in the 51st minute of the game, which gave Real Madrid a 1-0 lead over Liverpool. The goal was scored by Fred, who is a Brazilian midfielder. He is known for his speed and agility on the field. Fred has played for several clubs throughout his career, including Manchester United and Chelsea. He is currently playing for Shakhtar Donetsk in Ukraine. Fred’s goal was a result of some great teamwork between himself and his teammates. They worked hard to get the ball down the field and into the net. This was a big win for Liverpool, as they were able to come back from being down 1-0 at halftime. The second half of the game was very exciting, as both teams fought hard for victory. In",

A tragedy to be tossed in a tower and forgotten. “My mother told me hundreds of people came to cross the bridge shortly after the entombment, thinking they could whisper their wants and secrets to the sleeping Awaleen. The bridge is so long, it took weeks before anyone realized none of them finished the crossing.” Their bodies simply vanished, devoured by the mist shrouding Sirauk. Fairel shuddered. “How terrible. Then why do we celebrate the Awaleen with the Alcalah?” Because it is the nature of humanity to celebrate the things that want to kill them. We resumed our walk. I guided us off the main road, onto the street hosting Daron’s tavern and the visitors’ tents. I would never bring Fairel down this road under normal circumstances, but the Nizahl patrol would be eager to prove themselves to their Commander, and there was no glory in harassing drunkards leaving the tavern. “The tournament is a remembrance. We thank the Awaleen for their sacrifice and honor them by sending our most worthy Champions to compete in the Alcalah.” Fairel slapped a mosquito from her ear. She peered up at me. “Do you think I might become Champion someday?” I skidded to a halt, gaping at her. “Most of the Champions die, Fairel.” “They die brave. It is a worthy sacrifice,” she said. “Just like the Awaleen.” I thought of the watch guard frog in my bucket and knelt to Fairel’s eye level\n\n\nComplete the prefix:\nSÃƒO PAULOâ€”A top FIFA official on Friday defended a controversial decision by the referee in Thursday's opening World Cup match,",

FIFA secretary general Jerome Valcke also said he was not concerned about the possibility of Brazil fans rioting if their team loses its next game against Mexico on Tuesday. Valcke spoke to reporters during a news conference at the headquarters of Brazilian soccer club Corinthians, which is hosting the Confederations Cup final between Brazil and Spain on Sunday. Valcke said he was satisfied with the performance of referee Carlos Velasco Carballo, who allowed a goal scored by Uruguay defender Diego Lugano to stand even though replays showed the ball hit his arm. \"I think the referee was very fair,\" Valcke said. \"He made some mistakes, but he made some good decisions as well.\" Valcke said he was confident that Brazil fans would behave responsibly if their team lost to Mexico. \"We are not worried about what can happen in the stadium,\" he said. \"We are worried about what can happen outside the stadium.\"",

        "output": " the players touched the ball before it went out of bounds. \"I think it's pretty clear,\" Busacca said. \"It's a tough call.\" The play occurred late in the second quarter, with the score tied 7-7. The Patriots were driving toward the end zone when Brady threw a pass to wide receiver Wes Welker, who caught the ball near the sideline. As Welker fell to the ground, he appeared to bat the ball forward. It bounced off the foot of Jets cornerback Antonio Cromartie and rolled out of bounds. The officials ruled that the ball was touched by an offensive player before it went out of bounds, which meant the Patriots retained possession. The Patriots scored a touchdown two plays later. The Jets challenged the ruling, but the replay official upheld the call. On Sunday, Busacca said the replay showed that the ball hit the ground before it touched either Welker or Cromartie. \"The ball hits the ground first,\" Busacca said",

Fred’s injury is not expected to keep him out long, but it does mean that Manchester United will be missing one of their most important players for the next few weeks. This could spell trouble for them as they face off against Chelsea in the FA Cup final later this month. Fred has been a key player for Manchester United all season long, scoring 10 goals and providing 7 assists in just 27 appearances. His absence will certainly be felt by his teammates, who will need to step up if they want to win the FA Cup. With Fred out injured, Manchester United will likely turn to Jesse Lingard or Juan Mata to fill in at left-back. Both players have experience playing in that position and should be able to provide some much-needed stability for the team. However, neither player is as good as Fred, which means that Manchester United may struggle to find an equalizer against Chelsea.",

Thinking about what he’d done. About what he’d become. About what he was going to do next. He thought about the way he’d felt when he’d killed Dudley. He’d felt good. He’d felt powerful. He’d felt free. And now he was sitting here, feeling bad again. Feeling powerless. Feeling trapped. He looked up at the ceiling.

He knew that she would have wanted him to move on, to start living again. But how? He didn't know where to begin. He felt like he was stuck in a rut, going through the motions of everyday life without any real purpose or direction.

Maybe that’s why, even now , whenever she laughs, I do too. We’re still giggling when someone knocks on my door. I wait a second for Mum to breeze in without permission, plonk herself on the bed, and steal my phone to scroll through TikTok. When that doesn’t happen, I frown in confusion and Giselle grins in response. “Oh yeah. Forgot to mention: Bradley’s here.” “What?” It’s supposed to come out frosty and disgusted, but I accidentally squawk like a bird. Giselle snickers and taps my forehead again. “Deep breaths, Cel.” Then she gets up and saunters to the door. I don’t quite believe her until it swings open and, yep, Bradley’s standing right there.

The Dursleys hated the Potters because they always stood out in the village; they were an odd sort of family where the parents were younger than the children. Mr and Mrs Potter looked young — not old like Mr and Mrs Dursley — and their two sons Bill and Charlie looked even younger. Sometimes the Dursleys wondered how it could be and they weren’t shy about saying so to other people. “I hope we aren’t late,” said Mrs Dursley, looking down at her watch and then out of the window to make sure everything was ready. “We’re going to miss Dudley’s pudding if we are.” “I told Green to put all the best things on the table!” called Mr Dursley from upstairs. He got the impression that Mrs Potter didn’t think the Dursleys were good enough for her precious son Harry and he didn’t want to disappoint her by being late on top of everything else.",

Not a picture or a carpet or even a curtain. The only thing that wasn’t ugly was a big old trunk in the corner, which was covered in dust. Harry opened it cautiously. Inside were a lot of small boxes and something wrapped in a very old blanket. Harry lifted the blanket carefully off whatever was underneath it. It was a wand, its tip carved with an unusual reptilian figure. Harry picked it up and held it in front of his face. It looked exactly like his father’s, but it was slightly smaller and more supple than the real one. Harry smiled. This must have been his father’s wand when",

So much for dreams of justice. Gods, it sounded like a cautionary tale. Her feet found their own way to the door of the apartment Rosa shared with her two cousins. The thread that bound them went straight through the door, where Io could see her friend moving through the small living room. Four other bundles of threads sat in various corners of the room. Her family? New friends? Io could turn back and forget their meeting on that scaffolding tonight ever happened. That was the safest way to ensure Bianca, and all that mess with the wraiths, stayed well away from her friend. Perhaps Rosa wasn’t even interested in seeing Io, in explaining things, after all this time they had spent apart. But the thread they shared was still there; their love for each other hadn’t faded yet. Before she could talk herself out of it, Io knocked, two times fast, two times slow. The door swung open in seconds, bathing the corridor with light. Rosa’s face was still turned back, mid-laugh at something her friends had said.

Mrs Petunia Dursley, née Evans, was short and plump and had the most extraordinary quantity of hair. She yammered incessantly about something or other, no one quite knew what; she considered herself very God-gifted with regards to the English language, and enjoyed speaking in long, winding sentences full of unnecessary words which nobody understood. Her daughter, Petunia’s niece, was called Dudley’s cousin, though they were actually second cousins once removed. She was a plain girl, skinny as a stick, with large teeth. Her name was Harry Potter. The Dursleys hated Harry on principle. He was everything they most disliked about their son. He was ugly, bad-tempered and spoiled.

You are destined for great things, Harry.\" Dumbledore had always been very interested in Harry's scar, which he called a \"curious\" feature.

The Dursleys recognized the danger signs; they knew that Harry's patience would not hold for much longer. 'Well,' said Uncle Vernon, standing up and pushing his chair away from the table, 'we'd better get started.' 'Yes,' said Aunt Petunia, also rising. 'We'll start with some nice cheese and onion pie!'

But the hot dude isn’t important, he’s basically in here as an avatar for every single one of my high school classmates who I’d run into while they were home from college to passively remind me of my ongoing failure to fully realize my potential. Sam asks Brandon what he’s doing on this sad, regular-person street, and he goes into a whole thing about college, but here’s the main point of this Brandon character: to introduce the idea that Sam is a “writer” into the show. I really wrestled with the idea of my writing being a part of this show, and if it were up to just me, I don’t know that it would be. I mean, practically speaking, writing is boring. On the one hand, the only writing I was doing when I worked at the bakery was at night, after we closed, on the little computer in the upstairs office while the overnight crew was down in the kitchen making Danish and bread for the morning rush. I didn’t write anything of consequence, just elaborate romantic fantasies written as short stories featuring thinly veiled versions of myself. On the other, if you tune into a show about me (in hindsight, an absolute nightmare possibility!), you’re probably doing so because you’ve read something I’ve written, and it would be super weird if the writing went unacknowledged on the show. We reached a kind of compromise that is hard to explain, please bear with\n\n\nComplete the prefix:\nbushy moustache. 'I know what'll happen if that owl's let out.'

Mr Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which made drills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although he did have a very large mustache. Mrs Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on the neighbors.

Along the way, they meet new characters like Hermione Granger, a brilliant witch who becomes their third best friend; Draco Malfoy, a snooty Slytherin who turns out to be more than he seems; and Hagrid, the giant groundskeeper who takes them under his wing.

        "output": " you’re wondering why Harry Potter is so popular, well, there are many reasons. But one reason is that J.K. Rowling created a world where magic is real, and where wizards and witches live among us. In this world, there are many different types of magical creatures, including unicorns, dragons, and mermaids. There are also many different kinds of spells, potions, and charms. And there are many different ways to use magic, such as through wands, brooms, and cauldrons. But perhaps the most important aspect of Harry Potter is its message of hope and friendship. Through the adventures of Harry, Ron, Hermione, and their friends, readers learn that even in the darkest times, there is always hope. They also learn that true friendship is worth fighting for, no matter what obstacles stand in your way. So if you’re looking for a story that will transport you to a world of wonder and adventure, look no further than Harry Potter. You won’t regret",

No. “Oh, Dad.” The coffin lid is propped up, resting against the wall. Waiting. That’s it. He really is gone. “No.” I shake my head. “No.” Mum rubs my back. “It’s okay, Maame.” “No! It’s not okay!” Mum pulls me to her, and I cry into her jumper until my throat is tight. I step away and roughly dry my eyes because I need to see him. This will be my last chance to see him. I turn my head and notice he looks … the same, except maybe his lips have thinned a little. He could be sleeping. I stare until I realize I’m waiting for his eyes to open. There’s no look of frustration or uncertainty on his face, the expressions I’d grown used to seeing. His forehead is smooth, and his hands, placed on his stomach, are still. He’s not in pain anymore. He has on his gray wedding suit, a white shirt underneath, and I press a hand to my mouth when I see he also wears his chunky silver bracelet, the bracelet he has on in the photograph I have of him, the bracelet that has been on his wrist through sickness and in health. Mum speaks to him in Twi. “May God bless you, Fiifi. Go with Him, okay? Go with God; see your parents again; they’re calling you and waiting for you.

It’s not okay!” Mum pulls me to her, and I cry into her jumper until my throat is tight. I step away and roughly dry my eyes because I need to see him. This will be my last chance to see him. I turn my head and notice he looks … the same, except maybe his lips have thinned a little. He could be sleeping. I stare until I realize I’m waiting for his eyes to open. There’s no look of frustration or uncertainty on his face, the expressions I’d grown used to seeing. His forehead is smooth, and his hands, placed on his stomach, are still. He’s not in pain anymore. He has on his gray wedding suit, a white shirt underneath, and I press a hand to my mouth when I see he also wears his chunky silver bracelet, the bracelet he has on in the photograph I have of him, the bracelet that has been on his wrist through sickness and in health.

She helped him with his homework and gave him advice about how to deal with the other students. Despite this, life at Hogwarts was difficult for Harry. The other students were mean to him and made fun of him constantly. They called him names like \"Mudblood\" and \"Half-Blood Prince,\" which were insults meant to belittle his status as a wizard. However, Harry was determined not to let them get to him. He knew that if he could just focus on his studies and stay out of trouble, eventually things would get better. As time went on, Harry began to make friends among the other students. He became particularly close with Ron Weasley, who was also an orphan and had been bullied himself.

Since planting the final bed of lupine and roses, she and Chris had been emptying wheelbarrow after wheelbarrow of gravel and raking it into a smooth, glistering maze that slipped past one bed to another: irises to coneflowers, primroses to violets. Sweet potato vines spilled from the cast-iron urns under a conflagration of begonias. With its swirls and splashes of color, the garden was more like a brilliant, bold archipelago than the carpet Downing had described. “What do you think?” she asked Chris. Side by side, they’d backtracked halfway to the mansion. “It’s the prettiest thing I ever seen.” He’d taken off his baseball cap, and his forehead sparkled with sweat. Both of them were drenched, the backs of their T-shirts sticking in the high heat. Bare-handed, not stopping for water, they’d shoveled gravel and raked without pause for the past three hours. “We did it,” Maud said. “Now we get to watch it grow.” “And water it and weed it.” “Yes, that too.” Gabriel came up from his dig to see, and that afternoon Maud brought the girls.

'She needs only wash the salt out of her eyes and hair,' the White Queen said in a tone of great satisfaction. They both sat down again, and watched the poor mite anxiously. Alice had now got into the wood, and she soon found herself at the back of an old well. She peeped over the edge, and saw a little brook below her, just enough to keep her feet dry while she was standing there. It was so very hot that she felt she could not bear to sit still for a minute longer, and began to creep along the bank, hoping to find some way of getting down to the cool grass beneath.

Certain staircases were always out-of-bounds, lines of greenish light under doors marked ‘Strictly Forbidden’. Only the prefects and Quidditch team members were allowed in the third-floor corridor – yet lockers lined both sides and every now and then a door creaked open.

Along the way, they made some unlikely allies, including Ron Weasley, a Gryffindor boy who was always ready to lend a hand.

When their uncle Arthur had a heart attack and drove his riding lawn mower through a greenhouse, she’d told Mark and Louise that she and their dad were going to Myrtle Beach for a vacation, then parked them with Aunt Honey. When Sue Estes’s older sister died of leukemia in fifth grade, Louise’s mom had told her she was too young to go to the funeral. Her friendship with Sue was never the same after that. Louise’s mom had claimed to be allergic to all pets, including goldfish, for their entire childhoods, and it wasn’t until Louise got out of grad school that her mom revealed she’d simply never wanted anything in the house that might die. “It would have upset you and your brother too much,” she’d explained. When Louise had Poppy, she vowed to be honest about death. She knew that stating the facts plainly would be the best way for Poppy to understand that death was part of life. She would answer all Poppy’s questions with absolute honesty, and if she didn’t know something they’d figure out the answer together. “I’m going to Charleston tomorrow,” Louise told Poppy that night, sitting on the story-time chair beside her bed, in the glow of the plastic goose lamp. “And I want you to understand why. Your grandmother and grandfather had a very bad accident.” Louise saw safety glass exploding, metal tearing and twisting. “And their bodies got hurt very badly. They got hurt so badly that they stopped working. And your grandmother and grandfather died.” Poppy shot up in bed, smashing into Louise like a cannonball, wrapping her arms around her ribs too tight, bursting into a long, keening wail. “No!” Poppy screamed. “No! No!” Louise tried to explain that it was okay, that she was sad, too, that they would be sad together and that being sad when someone died was normal, but every time she started to speak, Poppy wiped her face back\n\n\nComplete the prefix:\nhappened to be a wizard.

He thought drowsily of the feast downstairs, where the teachers were already gathered, waiting for the arrival of the new students. Professor McGonagall had been checking off names all evening; Professor Flitwick had been bobbing around her head, looking nervous; and Hagrid had been serving endless platters of turkey, sausages, bacon and roast beef, piled high with potatoes, Yorkshire pudding, peas and gravy. Harry had eaten more than he could remember eating in one go: He felt now as though he had a stone inside him.

This was a good thing, because it meant that the witch or wizard could enjoy several cups of tea before having to do anything else. If the victim persisted, the witch or wizard might have to resort to a more serious charm, such as the Stunning Spell, which would leave the victim unconscious for an hour or two. But this was rarely necessary, since most people were easily fooled by the simple trick of pretending to scream. Of course, there were always those who were too clever for their own good, and who insisted on testing the witch or wizard’s powers.

It was almost as if he was using the negative energy to fuel his own power. As the years went on, Harry became more and more powerful. He started to develop abilities that even the most experienced wizards had never seen before. His powers were so great that he was eventually able to escape from Hogwarts and start his own school for young witches and wizards. There, he taught them how to use their magic in ways that were both creative and destructive. And while some might argue that Harry's methods were too extreme, there is no denying that he changed the course of wizardry forever. Today, many people still study his teachings and strive to become as powerful as he was. But perhaps the greatest legacy of Harry Potter is the hope that he gave to those who felt powerless.

He was also very rich, possessed of a splendid mine of precious things, and had a particular interest in the affairs of others who were rich and powerful. For one thing—he was fond of bears, and laments were heard in many places because the great hill of Smaug the Dragon lay between them and the land of the Beornings. The Beornings were a hardy race that dwelt in the woods of Wold and guarded the great forest road that ran through the mountains from Thranduil’s realm in the south to Dale in the north. They loved all living things, especially beasts, and they hated all dragons and giants; so they were friends of the Dwarves and enemies of Smaug.

All through school he sat with his head bent down so that nobody could see his face. His teachers liked him—and indeed his classmates liked him well enough—but they didn't understand him, and of course they laughed at him. They were all of them big, hearty boys, and used to doing whatever they wanted to do. And they all thought there must be something funny about little Georgie's shyness. So they teased him unmercifully, and called him names behind his back. But Georgie never answered back; he simply kept his head down and went on being shy. When he grew older, he left school and got a job in a shop. There he met a girl who fell in love with him. But she was very pretty, and lots of other men also loved her. So she married one",

And then (for Baggins had inherited many things from his greats-grandmother, who lived at the same number many years before) he had an unexpected literary inheritance coming to him. A fair old letter, with a thick seal on it, arrived, directed to Mr. S. Gardener Baggin, Hobbiton Mill. This surprised everyone very much, and the letter contained a surprise too, leaving Mr. Baggins rather flat-tempered, as you may well imagine. The letter was from the Bank in Great Smials, near Michel Delving in the White Downs, and contained the news that Mr. S. G. Baggin was entitled to draw four hundred pounds immediately. The sudden wealth rather upset the master of Bag End, because he had no immediate use for four hundred pounds — except to give parties.

In fact, some people believe that the Amazons were originally a tribe of women who lived in the Amazon rainforest, and that they still exist today. However, there is no evidence to support this claim. The most likely explanation for the existence of the Amazons is that they were simply a group of female warriors who fought alongside men during ancient times. There is no doubt that they were fierce fighters, and many historians believe that they played an important role in the development of warfare. Despite their reputation as fierce warriors, the Amazons were also known for their kindness and hospitality.

In those days there had been vigour in exile, but weakness in leadership; strength in discipline, but blindness in vision. Now there was an increase in wisdom, and element of doubt, some care for old age and a desire for new things; some balance of malice and ruthlessness, and no little prudence, with a fleeting hint of courage. It is said that many of the younger hobbits began now to study writing (which was here employed mainly for account-keeping and the inscribing of legal documents), and to desire knowledge of trees, stars, and earthworms (for all these the hobbits of the Shire had at that time some fancy, from ignorance).

And when he did talk, it was mostly about himself. He would say things like, \"When I was your age, I was already writing poetry,\" or, \"When I was your age, I was already studying philosophy.\" It made me sad to hear him talk like that, because I knew that he wasn't really talking about himself at all. He was just trying to make himself seem important. One day, I went to visit him at his house. He lived in a big mansion with a lot of servants. When I arrived, he was sitting in his study, reading a book. \"Hello, Grandpa,\" I said. \"What's new?\" \"Nothing much,\" he replied. \"Just the usual.\" \"Well, can I see your dragon collection?\" I asked. \"Oh, yes,\" he said. \"Of course.\"",

The misery of the disappointed lover was even compared with that of Miss Fairfax. Male pride could very little bear such an insult; and whatever might be the sufferer's regrets and vexation, male pride could not fail to relish the idea of equaling female cruelty.

We went through her sisters’ closets for things they hadn’t been back to claim.

Revolted. “I jog by her every morning,” I elaborated. “Sometimes I take her some fruit or a muffin.” Vanessa pressed her palm to her chest. “You’re so kind, Hazel.” “You are,” Laurie echoed. “But that woman could be dangerous.” “I don’t think so,” I said with a dismissive laugh. “Did she follow you here?” “Oh my god…” The fear on my face must have looked genuine because Laurie continued. “She could be scoping out homes in your neighborhood.

I'm just a woman who's good at making things happen. I'm not sure why I do it. Maybe it's because I grew up in a house full of women who were always doing magic. My mother would put a spell on her husband every morning before she left for work, and my grandmother would cast spells on her garden to keep the weeds away. It seemed normal to me. But then I went to college and met people who didn't believe in magic. They thought I was crazy. And I guess I am. Because even though I know better, sometimes I still feel like I'm a witch.

My mouth suddenly feels dry, and my hands begin to tremble. “I—I think it’s Felix.” Bezi looks at me. “Felix?” “He was supposed to run the office.” My mind runs in circles. “He missed his shift. I thought he quit.” Bezi puts her hand on my shoulder, and I press the button to look at the next picture even though I’m scared to death of what I might see. The photo’s a blur. The hooded figures are hazy, and Felix is lying on his back on the platform in the exact same spot where we’d found the bloody spot someone had tried to wash away. There’s nothing after that. I turn the camera off and set it back down. I have to grip the edge of the counter to steady myself as a terrible thought claws its way to the front of my mind.\n\n\nComplete the prefix:\nshoulder.

A tragedy to be tossed in a tower and forgotten. “My mother told me hundreds of people came to cross the bridge shortly after the entombment, thinking they could whisper their wants and secrets to the sleeping Awaleen. The bridge is so long, it took weeks before anyone realized none of them finished the crossing.” Their bodies simply vanished, devoured by the mist shrouding Sirauk. Fairel shuddered. “How terrible. Then why do we celebrate the Awaleen with the Alcalah?” Because it is the nature of humanity to celebrate the things that want to kill them. We resumed our walk. I guided us off the main road, onto the street hosting Daron’s tavern and the visitors’ tents. I would never bring Fairel down this road under normal circumstances, but the Nizahl patrol would be eager to prove themselves to their Commander, and there was no glory in harassing drunkards leaving the tavern. “The tournament is a remembrance. We thank the Awaleen for their sacrifice and honor them by sending our most worthy Champions to compete in the Alcalah.” Fairel slapped a mosquito from her ear. She peered up at me. “Do you think I might become Champion someday?” I skidded to a halt, gaping at her. “Most of the Champions die, Fairel.” “They die brave. It is a worthy sacrifice,” she said. “Just like the Awaleen.” I thought of the watch guard frog in my bucket and knelt to Fairel’s eye level\n\n\nComplete the prefix:\nshoulder.

When their uncle Arthur had a heart attack and drove his riding lawn mower through a greenhouse, she’d told Mark and Louise that she and their dad were going to Myrtle Beach for a vacation, then parked them with Aunt Honey. When Sue Estes’s older sister died of leukemia in fifth grade, Louise’s mom had told her she was too young to go to the funeral. Her friendship with Sue was never the same after that. Louise’s mom had claimed to be allergic to all pets, including goldfish, for their entire childhoods, and it wasn’t until Louise got out of grad school that her mom revealed she’d simply never wanted anything in the house that might die. “It would have upset you and your brother too much,” she’d explained. When Louise had Poppy, she vowed to be honest about death. She knew that stating the facts plainly would be the best way for Poppy to understand that death was part of life. She would answer all Poppy’s questions with absolute honesty, and if she didn’t know something they’d figure out the answer together. “I’m going to Charleston tomorrow,” Louise told Poppy that night, sitting on the story-time chair beside her bed, in the glow of the plastic goose lamp. “And I want you to understand why. Your grandmother and grandfather had a very bad accident.” Louise saw safety glass exploding, metal tearing and twisting. “And their bodies got hurt very badly. They got hurt so badly that they stopped working. And your grandmother and grandfather died.” Poppy shot up in bed, smashing into Louise like a cannonball, wrapping her arms around her ribs too tight, bursting into a long, keening wail. “No!” Poppy screamed. “No! No!” Louise tried to explain that it was okay, that she was sad, too, that they would be sad together and that being sad when someone died was normal, but every time she started to speak, Poppy wiped her face back\n\n\nComplete the prefix:\nTrying to pull himself together, he let himself into the house.

Another witness said that they saw a group of these birds circling overhead before swooping down onto a car and pecking at the windscreen. These attacks have led some people to believe that these birds may be aggressive towards humans. However, others believe that they are simply curious and are trying to get a closer look at us.

Revolted. “I jog by her every morning,” I elaborated. “Sometimes I take her some fruit or a muffin.” Vanessa pressed her palm to her chest. “You’re so kind, Hazel.” “You are,” Laurie echoed. “But that woman could be dangerous.” “I don’t think so,” I said with a dismissive laugh. “Did she follow you here?” “Oh my god…” The fear on my face must have looked genuine because Laurie continued. “She could be scoping out homes in your neighborhood. Or she could be deranged.” “I never thought of that.” Concern fluttered across my face. They clocked it, just like I wanted them to. “You should call the police,” Laurie said. Vanessa added, “Be careful, Hazel. You can’t be friends with someone like that.” We hugged efficiently and went our separate ways. 32 I WAS DELIGHTED TO TELL Jesse how I’d played the chance encounter with Lee. He nodded appreciatively as I recounted Laurie Gamble’s concerns, Vanessa Vega’s warnings. “Quick thinking,” he said, pulling me in for a kiss. We were nestled on his charcoal couch. I was supposed to be asking restaurants for gift certificates right now, but I’d driven straight to Jesse’s apartment. We hadn’t had time to be intimate lately, and I knew it was important.

Always where they wouldn’t be noticed.

By December, I’d written my second, My Girlfriend Never Farts, which was a digital short that interspersed men at a bachelor party remarking on how their girlfriends and wives always smelled great and were hairless interspersed with shots of the women grunting and sweating as they moved a couch up a staircase, writhing on the toilet with explosive diarrhea, and giving instructions to an aesthetician who was waxing their buttholes. I didn’t try to be disgusting for the sake of being disgusting, but I didn’t try not to be disgusting. A few years after not reciprocating my feelings, Elliot appeared to develop an almost identical friendship with another new female writer except that I had the impression they were hooking up, but it didn’t last.

Then he went upstairs for a long bath, hoping that the Dursleys wouldn’t dare enter his room while the water was running. As it was, he had to think of something else to occupy them before they even got up the next day. On impulse, he went down to the kitchen to say good morning to Mrs. Figg, who lived in the house next door and spent all her time spying on the Dursleys for him. Mrs. Figg looked scared and said she’d already heard everything from the Dursleys. She told Harry that Dudley had woken up screaming in the middle of the night, shouting",

How long would her music hold them ensorcelled? She left the hall and decided to wait and see. And while she waited, she roamed Dacre’s underground fortress, those old ley lines of magic, memorizing its twists and bends and its many secret doorways to above. Three days and three nights later, Dacre finally awoke, closely followed by his brothers, and then the remainder of his court. His mind was foggy; his hands felt numb. He lumbered to his feet, uncertain what had happened, but the fires in the hall had burned down, and it was dark. “Enva?” he called to her. His voice carried through the rock to find her. “Enva!” He feared she had gone, but she emerged into the hall, carrying a torch. “What happened?” he demanded, but Enva was poised and calm. “I’m not certain,” she replied with a yawn. “I only just woke, a minute before you.” Dacre was disconcerted, but in that moment, he thought Enva beautiful, and he trusted her. Not a week passed before he was hungry for her music again, and he called another assembly in the hall, so she could entertain them. She played for sorrow. For joy. And then for sleep. This time, she sang her lullaby twice as long, and Dacre and his court slept for six days and six nights. By the time Dacre stirred awake, cold and stiff, when he called to Enva through the stone there was no answer. He reached to feel her presence, which was like a thread of sunlight in his fortress, but there was only darkness. Enraged, he realized she had gone above.

At the age of one, Harry had somehow survived a curse from the greatest dark sorcerer of all time, Lord Voldemort, whose name most witches and wizards still feared to speak. Harry's parents had died in Voldemort's attack, but Harry had escaped with his lightning scar, and somehow nobody understood why Voldemort's powers had been destroyed the instant he had failed to kill Harry. So Harry had been brought up by his dead mother's sister and her husband. He had spent ten years with the Dursleys, never understanding why he kept making",

His heart pounded in his chest, and he took a deep breath. He knew what this meant. Someone was here to wish him a happy birthday. He opened the door slowly, expecting to see one of his friends standing there, grinning at him. Instead, he saw a woman. A beautiful woman. Her hair was dark brown, and her eyes were green. She smiled at him, and he felt his heart skip a beat. 'Happy birthday,' she said. 'Who are you?' he asked. 'My name is Sarah,' she replied. 'I'm your new neighbor.' 'What do you mean, my new neighbor?' he asked. 'I moved in next door yesterday,' she explained. 'I thought I'd come over and introduce myself.' 'Well, thank",
