5,Article 5,By David Pogue
7,Article 7,"December 27, 2020 / 9:33 AM EST / CBS News"
10,Article 10,Correspondent David Pogue reminds us of some of the often-overshadowed bright spots of the past year.
12,Article 12,"2020 will not be remembered as a big year for good news. But science and technology actually scored a few triumphs – beginning with the piece of software that made it possible for meetings, classes, relationships, and performances to carry on."
14,Article 14,"I'm referring, of course, to Zoom video calls, like the one I had with my 92-year-old dad, Cleveland lawyer Dick Pogue."
16,Article 16,"""Hello, Dave!"""
18,Article 18,"""So, am I correct that you had never used Zoom until the lockdown began?"""
21,Article 21,"""Absolutely not. I was amazed when I first saw it."""
23,Article 23,"""Apple, Google and Microsoft all had their own similar video programs. Why do you think Zoom became the winner of the pandemic?"" David asked."
25,Article 25,"""I think it's the simplicity of getting into the meeting."""
27,Article 27,david-pogue-and-dick-pogue-via-zoom-620.jpg
28,Article 28,"Despite a pandemic, Zoom has enabled Dick Pogue (right) to keep tabs on his son, David."
29,Article 29,CBS News
30,Article 30,"All the Zoom meetings meant fewer people flying, and all the closed offices meant fewer people driving. It's not the kind of economy anybody wants, of course, but it did lead to some more good news:"
33,Article 33,"For the first time in a century, you could hear birdsong in the cities; you could see fish in the canals of Venice; and you could see blue skies in L.A.!"
35,Article 35,los-angeles-air-smog-and-smog-free-620.jpg
36,Article 36,Los Angeles air quality improved dramatically with the economic slowdown and stay-at-home orders resulting from the coronavirus pandemic.
37,Article 37,CBS News
38,Article 38,"At one point, global greenhouse gas emissions fell 17 percent, the biggest drop in human history."
40,Article 40,This was also the year that the plastic pollution problem finally got the world's attention. We've dumping the equivalent of a truck-load's worth of plastic into the ocean every minute of every day.
42,Article 42,China joined more than 125 other countries that have banned or taxed single-use plastic or plastic bags.
44,Article 44,But you don't have to be a government to make a difference.
46,Article 46,Ordinary citizen Sheila Morovati was fed up with the more than 40 billion plastic utensils that restaurants include with take-out orders every year that nobody uses.
48,Article 48,"Pogue asked, ""So, if I take it out of the takeout bag and throw it in the trash, that's not single-use plastic?"""
51,Article 51,"""That's zero-use plastic!"" she replied."
53,Article 53,"Moravati undertook a one-woman campaign to persuade delivery services like Uber Eats and Postmates to make those utensils optional. ""Uber Eats and Postmates now have a checkbox that says, 'If you would like plastic cutlery, click here.'"""
55,Article 55,"2020 was also an astonishing year for space. NASA launched its most advanced rover yet to Mars; landed a spacecraft on an asteroid; and, for the first time since the Space Shuttle retired in 2011, flew American astronauts to the International Space Station on an American spacecraft made by SpaceX - twice."
57,Article 57,spacex-space-staiton-docking-111620.jpg
58,Article 58,"The SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule, moments after docking at the International Space Station, November 16, 2020."
59,Article 59,NASA
60,Article 60,"Finally, 2020 ended with the best piece of news science could possibly have offered us: Vaccines for the disease that ruined the year in the first place."
62,Article 62,"Pogue asked, ""Vaccines typically take years to develop – I mean, five, ten years. How was it possible that this one was developed so fast?"""
64,Article 64,"""This was really born of a great deal of cooperation between academics, industry and government,"" said Pfizer's head of vaccine development Bill Gruber, ""to essentially recognize this as the highest priority. One key element is that, as opposed to work typically being done in sequence, a great deal of work has been done in parallel."""
66,Article 66,"The vaccines hold the promise that this time next year, good news will be a lot easier to find.  At least that's what Pogue's dad thinks."
69,Article 69,"David asked, ""Do you have any broader thoughts about the year 2020?"""
71,Article 71,"""I'll be glad when 2020's gone,"" Dick replied. ""This was a bad year. But next year has got to be better, much better!"""

76,Article 76,Google's top trending search queries for 2020 highlight one of the strangest years of all time
77,Article 77,moneywatch
78,Article 78,By Dan Patterson
80,Article 80,"Updated on: December 9, 2020 / 3:10 PM EST / MoneyWatch"
82,Article 82,"The COVID-19 pandemic, protests, wildfires and a high-stakes presidential election: 2020 was one chaotic year, and a surge of people turned to Google for answers. Now the search giant has released the Year in Search, its annual snapshot of the year's most important search terms, news stories, entertainers and politicians."
84,Article 84,"To create the annual list Google aggregates trillions — yes, trillions — of queries over the course of the year, filters out junk data like duplicate queries, then tabulates a list reflecting the events the company says most defined the year. To identify trends, Google's algorithm looks for the percentage increase in searches for a term over a period of time, relative to other searches."
86,Article 86,"This year, searches for ""election results"" topped the list, and searches related to ""coronavirus"" were ubiquitous across categories. ""Kobe Bryant,"" ""Joe Biden"" and ""stimulus checks"" were also widely searched search terms."
88,Article 88,"""One thing that has been incredible to see in the data is the unprecedented shifts in people's information needs,"" said Google's data editor, Simon Rogers. For example, Google launched a COVID-19 news page when its internal trend tracking tools flagged a spike in searches related to coronavirus."
90,Article 90,"Instead of presenting a traditional page with search results, searches related to COVID-19 display timely and accurate information from vetted medical sources, like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, World Health Organization and local news sources."
92,Article 92,"""We worked with partners at the international, national and even local levels to connect people with the critical info,"" Rogers explained. The page also used public data sources to display updated information like COVID-19 statistics in Google Maps."
94,Article 94,"There were other atypical trends this year, Rogers said. The most interesting topics reflected how people adjusted to ""a new normal. Queries about ""Dalgona coffee,"" a popular comfort-food trend on social network TikTok, and ""banana bread recipes"" hit an all-time high, and questions about how to cut your own hair remained popular all year. ""Fires near me"" and ""earthquake near me"" were two of the top trending local queries this year."
96,Article 96,"This year marks the 20th anniversary of Google's Year in Search. ""Nostradamus,"" ""osama bin laden"" and ""eminem"" were the top queries when the list launched in 2001. At the time, the zeitgeist nature of the list was intended to demonstrate the scope of the fledgling startup's search technology and user base and to differentiate Google in a once-crowded search-engine market, which included competitors like Yahoo!, AskJeeves and Inktomi."
98,Article 98,"When the list launched it was just one simple webpage with a few subcategories. Today Google publishes hundreds of ""trending"" categories in multiple languages."
100,Article 100,Here are some of Google's top trending search queries for 2020:
102,Article 102,Searches
104,Article 104,Election results

154,Article 154,The 10 best films of 2020
155,Article 155,By David Morgan
157,Article 157,"December 30, 2020 / 11:18 AM EST / CBS News"
159,Article 159,"In cinema terms, 2020 is an asterisk year, at best. It was certainly not a great year for film — choked in production, constrained and starved in exhibition, and forced to be viewed through the prism of a global crisis that completely alters our reading of the movies and their messages. Most every film released this year was written, shot and edited before anyone had heard of the coronavirus, so their stories pretty much exist in a world that feels divorced from our current lives — escapism taken to the nth degree."
161,Article 161,"Still, of those films whose releases weren't postponed to 2021 A.V. (After Vaccine), there was a choice selection of movies worthy of a Ten Best Films list — and, thankfully, one great film that, pandemic or no, seems to exist outside of time."
163,Article 163,"1. ""First Cow"""
164,Article 164,Directed by Kelly Reichardt.
166,Article 166,"Two enterprising young men in the Oregon Territory of 1820 conspire to steal milk from the first cow brought into the region, in order to sell their tasty biscuits at the muddy trading post that stands in for civilization. Masterfully directed by Kelly Reichardt, ""First Cow"" is a primal drama of the American dream, and of people living on the periphery of wilderness, who would — in one fashion or another — help define a young nation's character."
168,Article 168,"John Magaro's tender, inviting performance as Cookie, working his way west in hopes of finding his place in the world, pulls us into the character's conflict with his own sense of shame. How far can he push himself beyond what would be considered the limits of acceptable behavior east of the Mississippi, when encouraged by Orion Lee's entrancing King-Lu, a personification of an American West opening its doors of opportunity to anyone with the brazenness and guts to enter? You feel Cookie's despoilment, and realize there can be no retreat, only a shared sense of commitment owing to their friendship."
171,Article 171,"And don't be fooled by the film's opening scene: The first several minutes are this gifted director's very effective and haunting demonstration of the impermeable fabric of time, and how some of its mysteries can never, ever be resolved by us."

182,Article 182,"""First Cow"" is currently available via Video on Demand and on Showtime."
184,Article 184,"2. ""Nomadland"""
185,Article 185,Directed by Chloé Zhao.
187,Article 187,"In her followup to her 2017 film ""The Rider,"" director Chloé Zhao again blurs fiction and non-fiction, in a story inspired by journalist Jessica Bruder's book ""Nomadland,"" an account of nomadic van dwellers eking out a life amid the fallout of the 2008 economic crash."
189,Article 189,"Frances McDormand stars as Fern, a widow who shuttles from state to state, job to job, living an itinerate life among other nomadic seniors whose quasi-retirement resides on a razor's edge between personal fulfillment on their own terms, and despair."
191,Article 191,"The direction by Zhao (which was honored as the year's best by both the New York and Los Angeles critics) is finely attuned to those on the margins, with a cast that includes some of the real-life people documented in Bruder's book."

197,Article 197,"After its debut at the Venice, Toronto and New York film festivals and a brief streaming run earlier this month, ""Nomadland"" will be released on February 19, 2021."
200,Article 200,"3. ""Never Rarely Sometimes Always"""
201,Article 201,Directed by Eliza Hittman.
203,Article 203,"An abused teenage girl in Pennsylvania named Autumn (Sidney Flanigan), who discovers she is pregnant, tries to induce a miscarriage but fails. She then travels, accompanied by a cousin, Skylar (Talia Ryder), to New York City, where she hopes she can obtain an abortion without requiring parental consent."
205,Article 205,"The film's trim execution, and Flanigan's almost naive reactions to the life changes she undergoes and the choices she must make, as well as Ryder's machinations when she discovers they are short on cash, dramatize the kind of shared experience that these young people will likely keep as a buried secret forever."
207,Article 207,"In this scene, as she is questioned by a counselor, the vulnerability of Autumn becomes almost excruciating and saddening to watch:"
210,Article 210,Never Rarely Sometimes Always | Clip - Never Rarely Sometimes Always by Universal Pictures Nederland on YouTube
211,Article 211,"Flanigan and Hittman were both honored by the New York Film Critics Circle, for Best Actress and Best Screenplay, respectively."
213,Article 213,"""Never Rarely Sometimes Always"" is available via Video on Demand."
215,Article 215,"4. ""76 Days"" (China)"
216,Article 216,"Directed by Weixi Chen, Hao Wu, and Anonymous."
219,Article 219,"From the start, this documentary of frontline health workers in Wuhan Province, China, at the beginning of the coronavirus epidemic is eye-opening — from a hospital employee's heart-wrenching pleas to be with her dying father, to the emotional turmoil of parceling out care to patients. The camerawork puts the viewer directly into ground zero of the virus, and the maelstrom of fear and ignorance about what halting the outbreak entails."
221,Article 221,"While many viewers may have become numb to the hell that medical professionals have experienced this year as the pandemic worsened, this film's bare-bones immediacy capturing the start of the outbreak reminds us how the lack of information made this new virus even more unnerving."
223,Article 223,"The most chilling scene in any movie this year records the sad accumulation of the victims' smartphones, bagged and waiting to be disinfected, which ring and vibrate with voicemail messages to the dead."
225,Article 225,"In this scene, medical staff must contend with a crush of patients in the waiting room trying to force their way into the hospital:"
228,Article 228,76 Days - Official Clip - The Waiting Room by Dogwoof on YouTube
229,Article 229,"""76 Days"" is available to rent via Virtual Cinema screenings."
231,Article 231,"5. ""Beanpole"" (Russia)"
232,Article 232,Directed by Kantemir Balagov.
234,Article 234,"The deprivations of Leningrad following the end of World War II are portrayed with a grim starkness in this heartwrenching drama — named Best Foreign Language Film by the Los Angeles Film Critics Association — in which two women are joined both by their shared experiences of war, and by a terrible personal tragedy."
237,Article 237,"The friendship between the statuesque nurse Iya, a.k.a. ""Beanpole"" (Viktoria Miroshnichenko) and Masha (Vasilisa Perelygina), who has returned home from the front, is the focal point in this story of survivors, barely, who try and fail to resurrect the life they had before the war, and instead must pick up the pieces from a worldwide trauma. Both of these first-time actresses are terrific."
239,Article 239,"In this scene, Masha tries on a dressmaker's frock, and in a shock of color gets to experience a pleasure that years of war have muted:"

245,Article 245,"6. ""Ma Rainey's Black Bottom"""
246,Article 246,Directed by George C. Wolfe.
248,Article 248,"Viola Davis and Chadwick Boseman lead a strong cast in this enthralling adaptation of August Wilson's play, about a 1920s blues diva and her backup musicians trying to get through a recording session."
250,Article 250,"The film is opened up slightly from the stage, but not enough to overwhelm or dilute this very intimate character drama. If anything, the new scenes give depth to the discourse about racial injustice, exploitation, and cultural appropriation. But they also give added excuses for music, which is appreciated."
252,Article 252,"In his last film appearance, Boseman is strong as the cocksure trumpeter Levee, whose brash attitude masks deeper insecurities and a propensity for violence. He and Glynn Turman were named Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor by the Los Angeles Film Critics Association. Davis (who won a Best Supporting Actress Oscar for another Wilson adaptation, ""Fences"") is terrific as the imperial Ma Rainey, whom you never want to make wait for her cold Coca-Cola."
255,Article 255,"In this scene, Levee confronts his fellow band members Cutler (Colman Domingo), Toledo (Turman) and Slow Drag (Michael Potts) about how to work with Whites in the music industry:"
258,Article 258,Chadwick Boseman Confronts The Band | Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom | Netflix by Netflix Film Club on YouTube

261,Article 261,"7. ""Wolfwalkers"" (Ireland)"
262,Article 262,Directed by Tomm Moore and Ross Stewart.
264,Article 264,"The filmmakers behind the 2009 animated movie ""The Secret of Kells"" return with this ornately decorated fable of a creature — half wolf, half human — and her friendship with the daughter of a huntsman ordered to kill all the wolves in a nearby forest."
266,Article 266,"This story of love and loyalties tested, mixed with humor, myth, and overtones of politics, make this a memorable, visual treat."
268,Article 268,"""Wolfwalkers"" was named the year's best animated feature by both the New York Film Critics Circle and the Los Angeles Film Critics Association."
270,Article 270,"Watch a trailer for ""Wolfwalkers"""

274,Article 274,"""Wolfwalkers"" is currently streaming on Apple TV."
277,Article 277,"8. ""Sound of Metal"""
278,Article 278,Directed by Darius Marder.
280,Article 280,"Riz Ahmed gives a haunting performance as Ruben, a musician whose loss of hearing precludes his loss of identity. As he struggles to accept that his hearing may not be recoverable, he risks alienating both the community of deaf who seek to help him, and his singer-girlfriend whose career, he believes, may be compromised by his disability."
282,Article 282,"Director Darius Marder, who collaborated with Abraham Marder and Derek Cianfrance (""The Place Beyond the Pines,"" ""Blue Valentine"") on the story and screenplay, is extremely creative in dramatizing the auditory imbalance that Ruben experiences as his ears fail him more and more."
284,Article 284,"In this scene Ruben goes for a hearing test, grasping to understand what is being said:"

290,Article 290,"9. ""Soul"""
291,Article 291,Directed by Pete Docter; co-directed by Kemp Powers.
293,Article 293,"With such recent successes as ""Inside Out"" (which explored the makeup of personalities), ""Ratatouille"" (sensory delight) and ""Coco"" (travels to the afterlife), the Pixar animation studio returns to familiar territory for a story that pulls from all three. While ""Soul"" seems similar, it has a bracing and inventive narrative, about a middle-school music teacher, Joe (voiced by Jamie Foxx), who dreams of a successful jazz career. When Joe has an accident on the very day of his most promising gig, his soul leaves his body, and is desperate to find a way back."
296,Article 296,"Being a Pixar film, ""Soul"" is filled with humor and wondrous production and character design, in this case representing a dimension where new souls acquire their personalities before they are shipped off to Earth. There is also blissful music, from the score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross (""The Social Network"") to the jazz compositions and arrangements by Jon Batiste."
298,Article 298,"In this scene Joe is introduced to a new soul, 22 (Tina Fey), who isn't ready for transit to Earth (and, we dare say, Earth may not be ready for 22):"

304,Article 304,"10. ""Lovers Rock"" (U.K.)"
305,Article 305,Directed by Steve McQueen.
307,Article 307,"This short feature (packaged by Amazon as part of a series of films by McQueen, titled ""Small Axe"") recreates the atmosphere of a 1980 house party of West Indian immigrants in London. We see the preparations, almost smell the food cooking, and witness as men and women congregate, dance, and enjoy reggae music — and each other."
309,Article 309,"There is no real script per se, and the characters do not cut deep, but there is a tactile feel for the period, through the clothes, music and décor, expertly captured by cinematographer Shabier Kirchner, while the male-female tensions are timeless."

318,Article 318,"Special mention: ""Hamilton"""
319,Article 319,Directed by Thomas Kail.
321,Article 321,"This stunning recording of the Broadway stage sensation was slated to have a theatrical release in 2021. But when the pandemic shuttered movie theaters — and postponed the summer release of the film version of Lin-Manuel Miranda's ""In the Heights"" — ""Hamilton"" was instead streamed on the Disney+ channel."
323,Article 323,"Having the revolutionary musical on our home screens, while reductive, made the story of the founding father more intimate, and the closeups of the actors capture their artistry in all its grandeur. At least, you didn't have to hope for a lottery win to score tickets to be in the room where it happens."
325,Article 325,"Clip: ""The Room Where It Happens"" featuring Tony Award-winner Leslie Odom Jr. as Aaron Burr."
328,Article 328,"""The Room Where It Happens"" Official Clip 2 | Hamilton | Disney+ by Walt Disney Studios on YouTube"
329,Article 329,"But ""Hamilton"" also prompts a discussion of what exactly a movie is nowadays. With cinemas closed and many productions released straight to video-on-demand, what separates a ""film"" from the ""content"" that clogs our scrolling Netflix feed is becoming increasingly blurred. While the preferred method to watch a film will always be to gaze up at images projected on a giant blank wall, where you can give yourself over to the story without distraction, a laptop will have to do if you don't want to chance spreading the infection to yourself or others. No movie (not even the Imax-sized ""Tenet"") is worth that risk."
331,Article 331,"With regard to ""Hamilton,"" there is little in the way of adaptation to a standard movie musical format, as Hollywood typically does; rather, it preserves the original Broadway cast, staging and costumes, as contained on the stage of the Richard Rodgers Theatre, for which future generations can be grateful. But just as the show was a touchstone in musical theater, perhaps this recording of ""Hamilton"" will become a touchstone in a new kind of filmed performance, with no allegiance to realism or naturalism (as we have come to expect from movies, even fantastical ones). True, ""First Cow"" and ""Nomadland"" would be nowhere if they didn't travel where they did, but do we always need all the world as a stage, when you have ... a stage?"

340,Article 340,"The air got cleaner in 2020, thanks to the pandemic"
341,Article 341,By Jeff Berardelli
343,Article 343,"November 19, 2020 / 4:40 PM EST / CBS News"
346,Article 346,"The global pandemic has changed the way people live and work: fewer miles on the road commuting and in the air traveling, and a reduction in industry. The result? Cleaner air, with less haze and heat-trapping greenhouse gases, according to one report."
348,Article 348,"The U.S. is on track to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels by more than 9% in 2020 compared with last year, according to research firm BloombergNEF. The last time yearly emissions were this low was 1983, nearly four decades ago."
350,Article 350,"While the reductions were driven by a combination of decreases in various sectors, including power and industry, the largest drop was transportation, which declined 14% from 2019."
352,Article 352,Reductions like this — if sustained — help fight climate change by trapping less heat in the atmosphere. More heat trapped leads to higher global temperatures.
354,Article 354,"But the report also contains bad news: Emissions from the historic wildfire season in the western U.S., which is partially driven by climate change, have been four times higher than the yearly average."
356,Article 356,acres-burned-new.png
357,Article 357,CBS News
358,Article 358,"That jump in wildfire activity will offset the U.S. economy-wide emissions drop by about 3%. But the U.S. should still post a 6.5% total decrease in emissions this year, according to the BloombergNEF report."
361,Article 361,That is almost the amount that experts say society needs to reduce emissions on a global scale for each of the next 10 years to keep the worldwide increase in temperature to less than 3 degrees Fahrenheit and avoid the worst impacts of climate change.
363,Article 363,"Because the pandemic's effects will linger into 2021, the report predicts U.S. emissions will be down 5% next year compared with 2019 levels."
365,Article 365,But a drop in emissions for a couple of years is merely a drop in the bucket. That's because greenhouse gases accumulate in the atmosphere and it is the cumulative emissions that determine how hot the planet gets and how bad the impacts of climate change become.
367,Article 367,"Although China currently contributes the most emissions, according to the report, the U.S. is responsible for almost twice the cumulative emissions of any other nation since the start of the Industrial Revolution."
370,Article 370,"The short term economic disruption caused by COVID-19 has inadvertently put the U.S. back on track to meet its commitments in the Paris Agreement, which President Donald Trump announced in 2017 he would pull the country from."
372,Article 372,"The U.S. is the only nation to drop out, but President-elect Joe Biden has said he will take action Day One to rejoin the pact."
374,Article 374,"Once COVID-19 restrictions lift, the return of people to work and cars on the roads will make maintaining the 2020 emissions reductions needed to keep global warming below international goals."
376,Article 376,"If the nation does rejoin the Paris Agreement, the BloombergNEF report says the U.S. will need stronger policy commitments outside of the power sector in order to hit its 2025 target. In other words, the U.S. will need to drastically reduce its dependence on fossil fuels to reach international goals."
378,Article 378,"The international community is getting an assist from renewable energy because it is now the cheapest form of energy on the planet, according to the International Energy Agency's 2020 Outlook, but experts say governments will need to implement robust policies to guide markets."

393,Article 393,By Jeff Berardelli
395,Article 395,"November 20, 2020 / 10:33 AM EST / CBS News"
398,Article 398,"Like so many other aspects of 2020, the Atlantic hurricane season hurled one shocking event after another, pushing the limits of what meteorologists thought was possible. Even as longtime records were falling and meteorologists felt as though they'd seen it all, 2020 had more tricks up its sleeve."
400,Article 400,"From the total number of storms to the rapid intensification and multiple landfalls, the records set in 2020 will likely stand for quite some time. What follows is a recap of the season's most astonishing milestones with an explanation of the factors that led to the events in this unprecedented season. Some of those factors are natural occurrences, while some are the result of human impact on the climate."
402,Article 402,Most storms in a season
403,Article 403,"So far, the 2020 Atlantic hurricane season has spawned 30 tropical storms, forcing forecasters to dig deep into the Greek alphabet for names, having run out of the assigned names in the middle of September. This breaks the former record set in 2005 of 28 named storms. A typical season only produces 12 named storms, so 2020 has already seen two and a half times more than average."

407,Article 407,"— Tomer Burg (@burgwx) November 17, 2020"
408,Article 408,"And there's still time for more storms. Hurricane season officially ends November 30, but  systems can and do form in December. So we're likely to add another couple of storms to the season total before the year is out."
410,Article 410,"From the beginning there was unanimous agreement among seasonal forecasters this past spring that 2020 would be an active season, with leading climate scientist Dr. Michael Mann of Penn State publishing the most aggressive forecast, predicting up to 24 storms. What seemed like a bold prediction at the time was not nearly bold enough."
412,Article 412,"The unanimous expectations last spring illustrate that all of the variables that portend an active season appeared to be emerging months ahead of time. In fact, they not only emerged, but overlapped with one another. Everything just came together."
414,Article 414,"North Atlantic sea surface temperatures were, and continue to be, far above normal in the entire basin, providing high-octane fuel to developing storms. Also, the West African monsoon, which ejects tropical disturbances into the far eastern Atlantic, some of which become hurricanes, was exceptionally active this summer."
416,Article 416,"In the main development region of the Tropical Atlantic, surface pressures are among the lowest in the historical record; low pressure equates to storminess. Lastly, there was an absence of El Niño in the Tropical Pacific. It is a well established fact that El Niño events tend to kill Atlantic hurricanes because of the strong upper-level winds (wind shear) they produce. This year El Niño's opposite developed — La Niña — yielding a calm environment with less wind shear, which helped nurture developing storms."
418,Article 418,Then there's the elephant in the room: human-caused climate change.
420,Article 420,"Since 1900, Tropical Atlantic ocean temperatures have increased by 2 degrees Fahrenheit. While it's clear warmer ocean temperatures make storms stronger, there's still vigorous debate among top climate scientists on the question of whether warmer waters lead to a greater number of tropical systems."
422,Article 422,"""My colleagues and I feel that the jury is very much out on the topic of global tropical cyclone frequency,"" said Dr. Kerry Emanuel from MIT, a leading researcher on how climate change affects hurricanes. While this Atlantic season was extreme, he points out that what we see in the Atlantic Basin is not representative of the rest of the globe. ""Only about 12 percent of the world's tropical cyclones occur in the Atlantic, and globally it has not been a very exceptional year."""
424,Article 424,"Mann agrees, but leans towards what he feels is the more compelling research he's seen, which points to more active seasons due to warming in the Atlantic. While some studies have found the opposite — suggesting a warming climate may lead to a decrease in storm numbers — Mann believes they used models that are insufficient to resolve the full spectrum of storms, which may have led to unrealistic results."
426,Article 426,"Mann says because of the exponential relationship between warming and evaporation, the formation of tropical systems is not linear. Instead, he says, it is ""threshold like,"" and his view is that ""a warmer world is likely to see far greater tropical cyclogenesis,"" referring to the formation of tropical storms."
428,Article 428,"For tropical storms to form, sea surface temperatures need to reach about 80 degrees Fahrenheit. It would stand to reason that since global warming has pushed sea surface temperatures up by 2 degrees in the Tropical Atlantic, then that threshold would be reached more often, in more geographical locations and at both earlier and later points in the season, breeding more spin-ups."
430,Article 430,Most storms to rapidly strengthen
431,Article 431,"While the first half of the 2020 season included incessant storms, they were mainly weak. That changed during peak season, August through October, and especially this autumn, no doubt owing partially to the development of the Pacific La Niña and the fact that the storms developed in the Caribbean — as they typically do during the fall — where some of the hottest waters in this hemisphere reside."
433,Article 433,"Six of the last seven systems experienced rapid intensification — defined as an increase in winds of 35 mph in 24 hours. This would be unusual at any time of the year, but the fact that these were all Greek alphabet systems, having occurred so late in the season, makes it all the more remarkable."
435,Article 435,"In total, 10 systems met the criteria for rapid intensification in 2020, tying a record established in the active 1995 season."
438,Article 438,"Even more impressive is that a record four systems ""rapidly deepened"" in 2020, meaning the pressure dropped more than 40 millibars in 24 hours. The two fastest pressure drops came at the tail-end of the season in November, when activity usually wanes — Hurricane Eta followed by Hurricane Iota."
441,Article 441,"Simply put, this is unprecedented. But if you dig into the data the reason is clear. The western Caribbean is already the home to the highest ocean heat content in this part of the world. But climate change is quickly boosting that heat past thresholds which were rarely reached in the past. The warmer the water, the stronger a storm can get."
443,Article 443,"The trend is clear in the red line below, showing the quick upward trend in the number of late-season days where sea surface temperatures exceed 83 degrees Fahrenheit."
446,Article 446,"This is also supported by science. In Emanuel's 2017 paper, he finds that a storm intensifying 70 mph in the 24 hours before landfall — a feat almost accomplished by Iota — used to occur only once per century as of the late 1900s, but by later this century it will happen once every 5 to 10 years. And this 2018 paper finds that rapid intensification has increased by 4.4 mph per decade since the 1980s, meaning if a hurricane increased its winds by 40 mph per day in 1980, then it would be likely to intensify by 60 mph per day now."
448,Article 448,Seven Category 5 storms in 5 years
449,Article 449,"Until mid-November, one check-box left unchecked this season was a Category 5 hurricane. That changed when Hurricane Iota attained winds of 160 mph. It is the most intense storm on record that late in an Atlantic hurricane season."
451,Article 451,"In each of the last five hurricane seasons we have seen at least one Category 5 hurricane — seven of them in total. This is a significant feat considering that in the last 170 years, the National Hurricane Center estimates there have only been 37 Category 5 storms. This means the chance of any given year yielding a Category 5, historically, is only about 20%."
454,Article 454,"For the 1st time on record (since 1851), we have 5 straight years with a Category 5 #hurricane in the Atlantic."
456,Article 456,2016: Matthew

464,Article 464,"— Jake Carstens (@JakeCarstens) November 16, 2020"
465,Article 465,"It's not coincidence, it's climate change. In the past 120 years the Tropical Atlantic has warmed 2 degrees Fahrenheit. Theoretically, for every 2-degree Fahrenheit increase in ocean warming, a storm can gain almost 20 mph in peak wind speed."
467,Article 467,"The latest research supports this trend in stronger storms. In a paper published earlier this year, NOAA's Dr. James Kossin found major hurricanes (Category 3, 4 and 5) are indeed increasing. Kossin told CBS News, ""Globally, there's about a 25% greater chance now that a hurricane will be at major hurricane intensity than four decades ago. In the Atlantic there's about twice the chance."""
470,Article 470,"This matters because the power and corresponding damage potential of a hurricane increases exponentially as the winds increase. In fact, 85% of the damage from all hurricanes is caused by the major hurricanes. So, if you have stronger hurricanes you are likely to have exponentially more damage."
472,Article 472,Record U.S. landfalls
473,Article 473,"So far this season there have been 12 U.S. landfalls, shattering the old record of nine set in 2016. In what was a relentless season for people living near the Gulf of Mexico, nine of this year's landfalls happened along the U.S. Gulf Coast and five of them occurred in Louisiana."
475,Article 475,"#Eta becomes the 12th named storm, and first in Florida, to make landfall on the U.S. mainland in 2020. This further creates separation from the previous record (9) set in 1916. pic.twitter.com/hEElsPOU1t"
477,Article 477,"— Steve Bowen (@SteveBowenWx) November 9, 2020"
478,Article 478,"And in what may be the most freakish of occurrences, dual hurricane landfalls occurred just miles from each other on three occasions: Laura and Delta in Louisiana, Delta and Zeta in Mexico's Yucatan, and Eta and Iota in Nicaragua."
481,Article 481,Where 2020 fell short
482,Article 482,"While 2020 overperformed in nearly every category, there is one surprising statistic which was not all that impressive: Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE). This is a widely used metric for meteorologists to estimate the intensity of a hurricane season because it is an aggregation of the strength and longevity of all storms."
484,Article 484,"To be sure, ACE was far above the normal season, but it fell far short of what would be expected for 30 storms. To date, the total ACE for the 2020 hurricane season is 178, nowhere near the record of 245 set in 2005. That's because 2005 also had four Category 5 hurricanes, compared to only one this year; more hurricanes overall than 2020; and longer lasting storms, too."
486,Article 486,"The 2004 season, featuring hurricanes Charley and Ivan, had only half the number of storms of 2020 yet produced more ACE."
489,Article 489,"So why did 2020 underperform in the ACE department? One reason is that the first half of the season produced mostly weak systems. And unlike 2005, when many of the hurricanes were long-track storms, most of the strongest storms in 2020 formed closer to land so they did not last as long. This was especially true for the end-of-season Greek alphabet named storms, many of which formed in the Caribbean and made landfall shortly thereafter. They just did not have the time to accumulate as much ACE."
492,Article 492,"While many of the records set in 2020 will likely stay in the record books for years to come, one thing is certain: As long as society continues to release heat-trapping greenhouse pollution, climate change will continue to power hurricane seasons that defy the odds."

497,Article 497,U.S. to shatter record for billion-dollar climate disasters in 2020
498,Article 498,By Jeff Berardelli
500,Article 500,"December 10, 2020 / 4:20 PM EST / CBS News"
503,Article 503,"From social justice protests to politics to the pandemic, 2020 has been unprecedented in any number of ways. And although it didn't always receive top billing, the climate crisis and the extreme weather that comes along with it also escalated to levels not experienced before. The U.S. experienced major disasters like the western wildfires, a record-breaking hurricane season and the mid-summer Midwest derecho that caused extensive damage."
505,Article 505,"So far this year, NOAA's National Center for Environmental Information (NCEI) says the U.S. has been bombarded by 16 different weather and climate-related disasters with a financial toll of one billion dollars or more — tied for the most with 2011 and 2017. However, the events included in this year's count have only been tabulated through the end of September and are expected to blow past that number once the final result is released in early January."
507,Article 507,"In a webinar organized by Climate Central on Thursday, Adam Smith, the head of NCEI's Billion Dollar Weather and Climate effort, said he expects ""we will shatter the previous record,"" far outpacing the yearly average of 6.6 such events and potentially reaching a total of 20 individual disasters each which cost a billion dollars or more."
509,Article 509,This is the sixth consecutive year in which the U.S. has experienced 10 or more billion-dollar weather and climate-related disasters.
511,Article 511,2020bdd-top5-en-title-lg.jpg
512,Article 512,Climate Central
513,Article 513,"Steve Bowen is a meteorologist and head of catastrophe insight for Aon PLC, a professional services firm focused on risk. He says these losses are escalating due to two main factors: more intense or ""unusual"" events, and more people and ""stuff"" in harm's way."
516,Article 516,The more intense and usual events are powered by excess heat energy being trapped in the ecosystem by greenhouse gases from the burning of fossil fuels. But Bowen says the location of where people are moving has really amplified disaster costs as well.
518,Article 518,"""Some of the fastest-growing areas of the country include parts of the Southeast, Plains, Rockies, and the West that have been historically prone to high-impact events like hurricanes, severe convective storms, flooding, and wildfires,"" said Bowen. ""If you add more people into regions that are the most vulnerable to direct impacts from climate change-influenced events, you're setting the stage for more risk and subsequent human and physical costs."""
520,Article 520,"While the frequency of these events matter, Bowen says what is more meaningful is the location and intensity of these events because that is what drives the risk."
522,Article 522,"The most notable such events this year were the wildfires in the West, the multitude of hurricane landfalls along the Gulf Coast, and the extremely strong derecho in the Midwest. All of these were beyond modern precedent and all were in areas where population is expanding and assets are becoming more valuable."
524,Article 524,billion-dollar-disaster-climate-events.jpg
525,Article 525,NOAA
526,Article 526,"Professor Stephen M. Strader, a severe storms meteorologist and expert on hazards and disaster at Villanova University, agrees with Bowen and says it is difficult to separate the climate hazard event and the societal exposure and vulnerability aspects of disasters. Therefore, we can't say what proportion of the increase in damage is due to climate change and what proportion is due to greater exposure, but he says  each play a vital role and are also rapidly changing."
529,Article 529,"""Together, this is not just a recipe for disaster, it's a recipe for repetitive disasters,"" Strader said."
531,Article 531,"""Ignoring the effects of a changing climate, our expanding developed footprint alone is driving an uptick in hazard impact magnitude, frequency, and disaster losses,"" explains Strader. This expanding footprint of developed areas is something he calls the expanding bullseye — an illustration of how our population is moving into areas where greater hazards exist."

536,Article 536,Wildfires
537,Article 537,"According NOAA and Climate Central, the greatest damage in 2020 came from the most severe fire season on record, which doubled the typical amount of acres burned. The vast majority of wildfires happened in the western states, where California endured 5 of its 6 largest fires on record and Colorado had 3 of its 4 largest wildfires on record. Scientists blame the longer and more intense fire seasons on warming and drying due to climate change."
539,Article 539,The American Red Cross says wildfires and hurricanes contributed to a record need for emergency shelter this year.
541,Article 541,Hurricanes
542,Article 542,"The Atlantic hurricane season was the busiest on record with 30 named storms. Of those, a record 12 systems made landfall in the U.S. The Gulf Coast was hit by 9, shattering the previous record. While these landfalls significantly contributed to the damage totals, none of the strongest hurricanes hit a densely populated U.S. city like Houston, Tampa or Miami."
544,Article 544,"In years past the greatest economic cost came from major hurricanes like Harvey, which impacted densely-populated Houston, costing an estimated $125 billion. That is why 2017, about $450 billion in damage, stands out as one of the years with the greatest damage."
546,Article 546,"This year the total figure will be more modest. So far, the total up through September is estimated at $46.6 billion. Smith expects the total number may reach $100 billion and enter the top 5 costliest years, though still far less than the $450 billion cost in 2017 — and an illustration of just how significant a factor intense events hitting population centers are. Smith notes that these damage assessments do not include the human cost, either the loss of life or the impact to health."
549,Article 549,Midwest derecho
550,Article 550,"For a meteorologist, perhaps the most memorable event of the year was the August derecho — a storm Smith described as an inland hurricane — which plowed a path 800 miles long and 40 miles wide through Iowa and Illinois. A broad area experienced hurricane-force winds, sometimes lasting 50 minutes, with gusts reaching 140 mph."
552,Article 552,"So far the damage from the derecho is estimated at $7.5 billion, but Smith expects that total to climb as more data is tallied. While this event was not caused by climate change, there is some evidence it was made stronger by it."

559,Article 559,"""Much of the news about 2020 disasters and the associated records will likely be overshadowed by the pandemic, politics, societal issues, etc.,"" said Strader.

911,Article 911,"Congresswoman Joyce Beatty, a member of the Congressional Black Caucus, demanded that the Voting Rights Act of 1965 be fully restored.

942,Article 942,"MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm Margaret Brennan in Washington. And this week on FACE THE NATION, halfway through this year's unconventional political conventions, the spotlight turns to the Republicans to make their case that President Trump deserves a second term. With the Democratic convention now a wrap, its message was loud and clear and far more negative than in years past. But in 2020, there is no business as usual."
944,Article 944,JOE BIDEN: The current President has cloaked America in darkness for much too long. Too much anger. Too much fear. Too much division.
946,Article 946,PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: This administration has shown it will tear our democracy down if that's what it takes for them to win.

We'll have the latest on efforts to ensure your vote gets counted. Plus, we'll hear what the GOP has planned this week from the head of the Republican Party, Ronna McDaniel. Biden national campaign co-chair and Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti will also join us. And will the convention be overshadowed by the stunning arrest of former Trump White House aide in 2016 campaign strategist Steve Bannon. He's been charged with fraud in a fundraising scheme to build the President's border wall. This, as the Republican-led Senate Intelligence Committee concluded that former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort's ties to Russia pose a ""…grave counterintelligence threat"" during the 2016 campaign. We'll talk with the former head of the FBI James Comey. We'll get the latest on the coronavirus from former FDA Commissioner Doctor Scott Gottlieb, then talk with the president of the University of Arizona Robert Robbins as some schools are forced to make dramatic changes in their COVID-era learning plans as students head back to school."

956,Article 956,"Good morning and welcome to FACE THE NATION. With just ten weeks to go until Election Day, former Vice President Joe Biden has maintained his ten-point lead over President Trump following the Democratic convention. That's according to our CBS News Battleground Tracker. And there is yet another scandal facing the President on the eve of his convention, new audio recordings have surfaced of President Trump's sister Maryanne Trump Barry sharing some candid thoughts about her brother. CBS News has obtained those tapes and as of, yet, we have not independently verified their authenticity. White House correspondent Weijia Jiang reports."
958,Article 958,"WEIJIA JIANG (CBS News White House Correspondent/@weijia): Margaret, the recordings paint President Trump as a liar who does not read and even paid someone to take his SATs.

982,Article 982,"WEIJIA JIANG: The bill would also reverse recent operational changes that resulted in nationwide mail delays, forcing the return of machines and mailboxes that were already removed.

998,Article 998,"MARGARET BRENNAN: The AP is reporting that the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, will be addressing the forum from Israel where he's on official business. This lineup, when you start hearing about cabinet members being involved-- I mean, first of all, it's very unusual for a diplomat to get involved in domestic politics. But this starts to look like using taxpayer-funded federal resources for a campaign. Will taxpayers be reimbursed?"
1000,Article 1000,"RONNA MCDANIEL: I can only tell you, Margaret, that the events that we've put forward from the RNC and the campaign are going to be paid for by the convention from-- from-- of the RNC and the campaign. You know, everything that we've put together has changed because of COVID. The President rightly said we're going to leave Jacksonville because we don't want to have resources taken away from a city that's dealing with a pandemic. And he brought it back to the White House, which is his residence."
1002,Article 1002,MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.
1004,Article 1004,"RONNA MCDANIEL: And it's being paid for by the Republican National Committee and the campaign, not the taxpayers."
1006,Article 1006,"MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you are confirming that Pompeo's trip will be reimbursed by the campaign?"
1008,Article 1008,"RONNA MCDANIEL: I-- I am not confirming anything having to do with Secretary Pompeo's trip. I am just saying the programming, the staging, everything that we're doing will be paid for by the Republican National Committee and the campaign."
1010,Article 1010,"MARGARET BRENNAN: You will have, as you said, some in-person activity there in Charlotte. I heard you have something like three hundred people gathering there for official business. How are you going to protect them all from COVID? This is a mass gathering."
1012,Article 1012,"RONNA MCDANIEL: You know, Margaret, I think it's really important to understand that the Democrats and Joe Biden just said we're going to shut this country down again. And that is a really elite view of America right now. Now from a safety perspective, we tested everybody before they came to Charlotte. We have been testing people on site. We are doing the things that are allowing people to live their lives, have a convention and do it in a healthy and safe way--"
1014,Article 1014,MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.
1016,Article 1016,"RONNA MCDANIEL: --which most Americans are doing going back to work because they're going to the grocery store, as they're going to hospitals. This is a realistic way of opening up our country and doing it in a health-- healthy and safe way. And the Democrats are saying, shut it all down. Well, that's easy for Hollywood celebrities and privileged politicians but that's not good for average Americans."
1018,Article 1018,"MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about the election itself. The President has said he expects this to be one of the most fraudulent, if not the most fraudulent in history. He's against mail-in ballots, but the Republican Party in Iowa has mailed absentee ballots to voters. Politico is reporting Pennsylvania, the GOP website is promoting vote-by-mail, similar situation in Ohio. Why is the Republican Party promoting something that the President says he's against?"
1020,Article 1020,RONNA MCDANIEL: I'm so glad you asked me this question because there is a very real difference between states that have tried and true absentee processes that have been in place and have been tested and work versus states like Nevada that ninety days out from an election have completely upended their entire election protocol and put chaos into their process because they haven't tested it and it isn't certain.
1022,Article 1022,MARGARET BRENNAN: But the post office said this week--
1024,Article 1024,RONNA MCDANIEL: And why are they doing that?
1026,Article 1026,MARGARET BRENNAN: --that they can handle the mail volume-- volume. They don't have a problem.
1028,Article 1028,"RONNA MCDANIEL: It's not about just the post office, Margaret. It's that they're sending ballots to unverified voter rolls. I just talked to a voter this week who said she's received three ballots for a different woman at her address, a person that's never lived there. These are the type of things--"
1030,Article 1030,MARGARET BRENNAN: A ballot or an application for a ballot?
1032,Article 1032,"RONNA MCDANIEL: An actual ballot. An actual ballot. She was in California. In Nevada and California, they aren't sending absentee request forms. They're sending live ballots, which I think is a huge problem. Getting an absentee request form--"
1034,Article 1034,MARGARET BRENNAN: But to be-- to be clear the Republican Party in these states is promoting mail-in voting. Is the Republican Party--
1036,Article 1036,RONNA MCDANIEL: No. We are-- we are--
1038,Article 1038,MARGARET BRENNAN: --supportive of that?
1040,Article 1040,"RONNA MCDANIEL: --promoting people embracing the absentee processes that have been put in place, that are tried and true. And we are suing states that are trying to change their process ninety days out from an election, which is adding chaos to an election where we should have certainty."
1042,Article 1042,"MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about some of our data that we just got. CBS News has a Battleground Tracker out, and it's showing a big divide between how Republicans view the U.S. response to the coronavirus and how the majority of voters see it. Seventy-three percent of Republicans say it's going well. Thirty-eight percent of all voters say it's going well by comparison. Then fifty-seven percent of Republicans say the number of dead is acceptable at a hundred and seventy thousand people. Thirty-three percent of independents say it's acceptable, just ten percent of Democrats. How could that number be acceptable? And why is there such a big divide between how Republicans see it and how the majority of people do?"
1044,Article 1044,"RONNA MCDANIEL: Well, I think that is a really unfair poll and-- and, of course, there is nobody in this country, there is nobody starting with the President of the United States who wants to see people pass away from this global pandemic that came here from China not being honest, from the WHO failing in their one duty, their one duty, to identify a pandemic. And they failed the global community. But let's be honest, Republicans do want-- do not want to see people suffering from this pandemic. We have all been affected by this. This is not a Republican or Democrat issue. When you see Democrats continue--"
1046,Article 1046,MARGARET BRENNAN: So you say that number is acceptable? You--
1048,Article 1048,"RONNA MCDANIEL: No, of course, not, Margaret. This is a global pandemic. Nobody wants to see somebody die from this. I have-- have had friends die from this. This is not something people want. But the President's response has saved lives by shutting down travel early, which Joe Biden called xenophobic, by doing the decisive actions he did earlier--"
1050,Article 1050,"MARGARET BRENNAN: From China, but not Europe."
1052,Article 1052,"RONNA MCDANIEL: He did it from Europe as well, but Joe Biden didn't--"
1054,Article 1054,MARGARET BRENNAN: Not until March.
1056,Article 1056,"RONNA MCDANIEL: But Joe Biden didn't support that. You didn't hear him come out and say we should shut down travel from Europe. You didn't hear Democrats saying that. They have opposed this President every step of the way. In a time of crisis when we should be coming together as Americans, this should not be politicized."
1058,Article 1058,"MARGARET BRENNAN: One area where Republicans also differ from voters overall is on the Black Lives Matter movement. Most voters nationwide agree with the ideas of it, while most Republicans, two-thirds of them, strongly disagree. Eight in ten Republicans think there has been too much attention on the issue of discrimination. Doesn't this type of thinking hurt Republicans' chances of making gains with black voters?"
1060,Article 1060,"RONNA MCDANIEL: Well, I think that there's a big distinction between the words Black Lives Matter and the movement, which has been led by people who embrace Marxism, who have said on networks, we want to burn this country down. And I think you have to separate that, because as we are seeing in the name of Black Lives Matter, these riots and these looters who really aren't affiliated with any type of peaceful protest, we all condemn what happened to George Floyd. Republicans and Democrats alike recognize that."
1062,Article 1062,"MARGARET BRENNAN: So you don't think there has been too much attention on the issue of discrimination? That was eight in ten Republicans said too much attention on that issue. Not the movement, but the issue."
1064,Article 1064,RONNA MCDANIEL: You know who's given more attention to discrimination than anybody? This President. He's the one who passed the First Steps Act to get rid of the injustices in our criminal justice reform. This is our President who's pardoned people who were unjustly charged with crimes and sentenced to lengthy sentences disproportionately affecting the black community. This is the President who gave more loans to HBCUs. This is the President that created economic opportunity zones. This is the President who has tackled discrimination. And he's going to continue to do so. And you're going to hear more about that next week in our convention as he talks about the policies he's put forward and how they have improved the lives of everyday Americans.
1066,Article 1066,"MARGARET BRENNAN: Ronna McDaniel, thank you for your time."
1068,Article 1068,"RONNA MCDANIEL: Thanks, Margaret."
1070,Article 1070,"MARGARET BRENNAN: We want to go now to national co-chair for the Biden campaign, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti. Good morning to you."
1072,Article 1072,"ERIC GARCETTI (Mayor of Los Angeles/@MayorOfLA/ National Co-Chair, Biden-Harris Campaign): Great to be with you, Margaret, thank you for having me."
1074,Article 1074,"MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to start on the issue of voting, because your state was specifically mentioned there by Ronna McDaniel as having increased mail-in ballots during the pandemic. During the March presidential primary more than a hundred thousand mail-in ballots were rejected by election officials, according to data that had been gathered by the AP. Given that experience doesn't that indicate that there are some significant gaps in terms of your state's election integrity?"
1076,Article 1076,"ERIC GARCETTI: A democracy is not an easy thing, Margaret, of course, but I have a very deep confidence in our secretary of state, Alex Padilla, in our counties, to be able to run elections and to run them well. And the difference is that we're trying to run elections that expand democracy, that give the vote to everybody where we see a war on voters in other states run by Republicans who literally want to take people off the ballot, take them off the election rolls, you know, a period here, a different-- a middle initial. We saw it happen with Stacey Abrams in Georgia. She would be governor today--"
1078,Article 1078,MARGARET BRENNAN: And Ronna McDaniel is saying you're adding people.
1080,Article 1080,"ERIC GARCETTI: And it's kind of ironic that Republicans-- no, we are making sure that every American in California who can vote will vote. That is, I think, what a democracy is about. Why we make it so difficult for Americans to vote--"
1082,Article 1082,MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.
1084,Article 1084,"ERIC GARCETTI: --seems to be anti-democratic with a small D. And so we're going to make sure that we have not only safe and secure elections, but a paper trail as well, something I think all folks from both the right and left have called for, for years."
1086,Article 1086,MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay.
1088,Article 1088,ERIC GARCETTI: I simply don't understand why this President fears this. It's probably because he knows he's going to lose.
1090,Article 1090,"MARGARET BRENNAN: On the issue of the economy, that is one area where President Trump still seems to poll-- have better poll results than candidate Biden does in terms of perception of who would be better for it. Joe Biden said a lot of things in his address this week, but he gave virtually no detail on his economic plans and no detailed criticism of President Trump's either. Isn't that a mistake?"
1092,Article 1092,"ERIC GARCETTI: Mm-Hm. Well, I-- I know here's the-- the facts, Margaret, Democratic Presidents have added sixty million jobs to America, Republican ones, twenty-three million in the last few decades. You want to see the stock market do better, the GDP over-perform, that's always been under a Democratic President and not a Republican one. And we're very proud of the plans that we have to not only bring back jobs, manufacturing--"
1094,Article 1094,"MARGARET BRENNAN: But isn't the slogan ""Build Back Better""? Wouldn't you need to, if that's your slogan, explain how you're going to do it? Joe Biden mentioned the economy four times. Economic was a phrase used four times, mentions five million jobs, but didn't say how he was going to do it. Why not emphasize that?"
1096,Article 1096,"ERIC GARCETTI: We-- we have been talking until we're blue in the face about the most progressive and most expansive economic plan that we will see in our, I think in our lifetimes in America. Build Back Better has four different planks to it. One is to invest in infrastructure, in a new green energy economy and careers throughout America. Two is manufacturing back in America, unlike this President who said he'd bring jobs back but has been offshoring federal contracts to foreign companies since he has been President. We'll build back everywhere in America. And, third, the care economy. So many Americans-- and it's such a contrast in these campaigns, Joe Biden, Kamala Harris are about what we can do to care for one another, whether it's our kids right now in child care--"
1098,Article 1098,MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.
1100,Article 1100,"ERIC GARCETTI: --or whether it's our seniors in the end of their lifetime. And then something that's usually a peripheral issue, racial justice is a core part, the fourth pillar of that plan. So we have detailed that you go to President Trump's website, just like when he ran last time, there's two or three things on the economy and that's it. It was build a wall."
1102,Article 1102,MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.
1104,Article 1104,ERIC GARCETTI: It was get rid of immigrants. He has no plan. And he's killing Americans right now and killing our economy. I think it's such a contrast between two people who have a heart and experience--
1106,Article 1106,MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.
1108,Article 1108,"ERIC GARCETTI: --what this country needs, and a man who has neither."
1110,Article 1110,MARGARET BRENNAN: Killing Americans is-- is a strong phrase there. I'm going to ask you about what's happening with Covid-19 in your own city. You told CNN last month that it is becoming much more of a Latino disease. Why is it still such an issue that people of color in your city are disproportionately affected?
1112,Article 1112,"ERIC GARCETTI: Well, a couple of statistics, what our lowest hospitalization rate since this has been recorded, we're at a positivity rate now that's about six percent. So we're really, I think, making huge progress and proud of that. But we're being left on our own. We're the first city in America to cut, I think, the African-American deaths, which were double throughout the country to under the population here. But for the Latino population, which I'm a part of and I come from, I think there's a couple of things. One is you had federal assistance that didn't go to many immigrants and to their families who could be married to or the child of an immigrant. And you didn't get the same money your fellow American citizens did. So they're being pushed to work more. They don't have access to the unemployment. They don't have as much of the kind of social network right now that we need. But we're making huge inroads, including in the Latino community right now. But this is something where you saw this President plant a seed when he ran for President, demonizing folks who are Latino, saying Mexican Americans were murderers and rapists and maybe there was a few good ones. This stuff has ramifications because it washes through a government--"
1114,Article 1114,MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.
1116,Article 1116,"ERIC GARCETTI: --that thinks it doesn't have to serve cities, doesn't have to serve Latinos. And we're seeing those numbers rise."
1118,Article 1118,"MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. I want to talk about your management, though, in your city. You made an interesting choice this week. You actually shut off the power at a Hollywood home after they were hosting large parties there because it wasn't abiding by your regulations regarding the pandemic. How many other houses are you going to shut off the utilities at? Why aren't people listening to you?"
1120,Article 1120,"ERIC GARCETTI: People are listening, they're far and few between our numbers are coming down, but where people don't listen, we're going to shut them down. That's critically important. This is not a time to be spreading this disease, especially younger people. And, by the way, I want to thank all the young people who said shut it down because they saw their peers acting irresponsibly. At super spreader events ten percent of people, Margaret, usually are responsible for about eighty percent of the cases. And we're just not playing here."
1122,Article 1122,MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.
1124,Article 1124,ERIC GARCETTI: We are not going to let people take our lives into their hands so they're shut down.
1126,Article 1126,"MARGARET BRENNAN: Mayor Garcetti, thank you for your time."
1128,Article 1128,And FACE THE NATION will be back in one minute with former FBI Director James Comey. Stay with us.
1130,Article 1130,(ANNOUNCEMENTS)
1132,Article 1132,"MARGARET BRENNAN: And we are back with former FBI Director James Comey. He used to be a registered Republican, but this week he will speak at the Convention on Founding Principles, which is a gathering of Republicans who are not happy with President Trump. Good morning to you."
1134,Article 1134,"JAMES COMEY (Former FBI Director/@Comey): Good morning, Margaret."
1136,Article 1136,"MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to get your reaction and insight into what we learned this week, which was that the Southern District of New York indicted former Trump White House official and campaign strategist Steve Bannon for alleged fraud. He's now the sixth close Trump associate to be criminally charged by the DOJ. You used to run the SDNY. What do you make of this case?"
1138,Article 1138,"JAMES COMEY: Well, it's another reminder of the kind of people this President surrounds himself with. At this point, they could almost start their own crime family. It's a very serious case. The Southern District of New York has laid it out in a very detailed indictment called a speaking indictment. And he's in a world of trouble."
1140,Article 1140,MARGARET BRENNAN: A world of trouble. What do you mean by that?
1142,Article 1142,"JAMES COMEY: Well, it's a very serious fraud case with a huge amount of money stolen from innocent victims, Americans who thought they were giving money to support the President's wall on the Mexican border and, instead, it was stolen. That will drive up the potential punishments for Mister Bannon and his co-conspirators. And, you know, he's in trouble because the indictment lays it out in such detail, including excerpts from texts. If you're Steve Bannon, you're his lawyers, you're reading this saying, I'm going down here. And I don't know what the next steps are for him and his co-defendants, but that's what I meant by world of trouble."
1144,Article 1144,"MARGARET BRENNAN: The Senate Intelligence Committee, we know, also sent a letter to the Southern District asking them to investigate Bannon for lying to Congress. Is there more that the public leads-- needs to know about Steve Bannon and any links to election interference?"
1146,Article 1146,"JAMES COMEY: I don't know. I don't know what the Southern District of New York is doing. I think this indictment surprised a lot of people because they did it like the pros they are. They didn't talk about it until they were ready to bring the case. But people can learn an awful lot about Russia and the Trump campaign just by reading the thousand pages that the Senate Intelligence Committee put out this week. It tells a story that blows up the President's nonsense about it being a hoax, that blows up Bill Barr's nonsense about there being nothing to investigate. There's a story there that the American people, if they're interested, can read and learn a whole lot about the kind of characters who were working with Russia during the 2016 campaign."
1148,Article 1148,"MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you more about that in a moment. We will have to take a break. But, very quickly, what do you see as the biggest threat to the rule of law right now?"
1150,Article 1150,JAMES COMEY: That even-handed law enforcement has disappeared from the Justice Department under Bill Barr and Donald Trump. It shouldn't matter whether Trump likes you or not. Everybody should get a fair shake. And that the truth is under attack--
1152,Article 1152,MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay.
1154,Article 1154,JAMES COMEY: --both by the attorney general and the President. Those things matter. That's why I'm speaking for the first time--
1156,Article 1156,MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay.
1158,Article 1158,JAMES COMEY: --ever at a political event this week.
1160,Article 1160,MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. We're going to take a break and come back and continue our conversation with former Director Comey in just a few minutes.
1162,Article 1162,(ANNOUNCEMENTS)
1164,Article 1164,"MARGARET BRENNAN: And this programming note, starting tomorrow night and running through Thursday, CBS will bring you coverage of the Republican National Convention led by CBS EVENING NEWS anchor Norah O'Donnell, along with our political team. Tune in. Beginning at 10 PM Eastern."
1166,Article 1166,(ANNOUNCEMENTS)
1168,Article 1168,MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back with more from former FBI director James Comey and later the latest on the coronavirus from Dr. Scott Gottlieb. Stay with us.
1170,Article 1170,(ANNOUNCEMENTS)
1172,Article 1172,MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION.
1174,Article 1174,"We're continuing our conversation with former FBI Director James Comey. I want to pick up where we left off, which was that Senate Intelligence report. This is a bipartisan report, meaning Republicans signed off on it. This was three years long. And the conclusion here was that Trump campaign chair Paul Manafort represented a, quote, ""grave counterintelligence threat"" to the U.S. because of his close work with Russian intelligence officer Konstantin Kilimnik. This goes farther than what Mueller concluded and made public. Why? Why is the public just now hearing about it?"
1176,Article 1176,"JAMES COMEY: Because the Senate Intelligence Committee was looking at all information they could gather. Mueller was approaching it as a prosecutor, trying to see what evidence he could bring into court to prove something beyond a reasonable doubt. And so the Senate Intelligence Committee could look much more broadly and, as you said, came to this conclusion that the head of Trump's campaign was funneling information to a Russian intelligence officer, someone he likely knew was a Russian intelligence officer. Let that sink in and then ask yourself, so there was nothing to investigate here, as Bill Barr says, it was a hoax? The Republicans have exploded that nonsense."
1178,Article 1178,"MARGARET BRENNAN: The report, though, also was critical of your old agency, the FBI. It said your bureau should have done more to alert DNC officials that Russian hackers had accessed their servers. Why didn't the FBI do this? This was a national security threat happening under the nose of the FBI."
1180,Article 1180,"JAMES COMEY: Yeah. That's-- I understand that. That's fair criticism. I think at the time, our folks thought that just telling an institution that the Russians are inside your house was enough. But I think part of what may have led to a lack of urgency at the DNC and at the FBI is that nobody anticipated this wasn't normal intelligence gathering by the Russians, this was an effort to weaponize. And if anybody had seen that, I think they would have yelled a little bit more loudly."
1182,Article 1182,"MARGARET BRENNAN: Was that a mistake on your part? I mean, how did the FBI miss that this was an active measures campaign by a foreign intelligence service?"
1184,Article 1184,"JAMES COMEY: That's a great question. I think the simple answer is because it had never happened before, but if I were still director of the FBI, that wouldn't be a good enough answer. I hope they're taking a look back across the intelligence community and asking, so why didn't we imagine that the Russians might do this? But the truth is that we didn't. Nobody in the intelligence community did."
1186,Article 1186,"MARGARET BRENNAN: When you were FBI director, you never imagined this scenario. I mean don't you think this was a mistake on your part?"
1188,Article 1188,"JAMES COMEY: I sure think it was a miss-- a-- a mistake, I'm not going to quibble on words. Yeah, it was a miss. I don't know why it didn't occur to us that the Russians were doing something that they had never done before, which is to weaponize and actually fire stolen material at our Democratic process. And, look, looking back in hindsight, it seems obvious. I don't know the answer as to why nobody in the intelligence community, none of the analysts, saw this coming. And it ought to be something that we're asking ourselves."
1190,Article 1190,MARGARET BRENNAN: Are we still this vulnerable?
1192,Article 1192,"JAMES COMEY: Yes, in a different way. I'm sure the Russians will use different tactics because we figured out what they were last time. They achieved their objectives in the last election. They've done incredibly well under President Trump. They want him to stay in office. They'll be coming again. And the problem for us as Americans is you can't effectively stop a threat that the President won't even acknowledge exists. And so, sure, they're going to be in our house again, messing with us. The only way we're going to kick Putin out of our elections is to elect Joe Biden President so someone finally puts real pain on the Russians."
1194,Article 1194,MARGARET BRENNAN: What does real pain look like? I mean we've been warned by the U.S. intelligence community that interference is happening again. President Trump is talking about election interference in very different terms. I actually want to play for you something that he said this week. He said that this will be the most fraudulent election in U.S. history. And he told this to Fox News.
1196,Article 1196,"PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP (on phone): We're going to have everything. We're going to have sheriffs, and we're going to have law enforcement, and we're going to have, hopefully, U.S. attorneys, and we're going to have everybody and attorney generals."
1198,Article 1198,"MARGARET BRENNAN: He's talking about fraud at the ballot box. He's talking about fraud in the mail. He's talking about fraud by receiving a ballot in the first place. What the President just described in that soundbite is, frankly, illegal in many states. It's up to local authorities when it comes to sending out local law enforcement, but he's making clear what he wants to see happen. What do you make of what he's laying out?"
1200,Article 1200,"JAMES COMEY: Well, I'm sure the next question Fox News asked was, what are the facts that support your allegations of fraud? And there were crickets. I trust state, local and federal law enforcement to honor their oath to the rule of law and to not be part of suppressing votes. There's a legitimate role for law enforcement to play in connection with elections. And I'm confident that the men and women in law enforcement at all levels will abide by their oath."
1202,Article 1202,"MARGARET BRENNAN: In other words, not do this. In terms of--"
1204,Article 1204,"JAMES COMEY: Yeah. We-- this is-- this is America. We don't-- we don't-- at least we don't anymore, we did it a whole lot to African-Americans when I was a child, we don't anymore use cops to scare people away from polling places. We just don't do it. And I'm confident that police officers around this country are not interested in being part of an illegitimate effort like that."
1206,Article 1206,MARGARET BRENNAN: I have to ask you the Justice Department is investigating the investigation into 2016. Do you know if you are a witness or a target or have you sat for an interview with John Durham as part of the investigation?
1208,Article 1208,"JAMES COMEY: Yeah, I have no idea. I've had no contact with him and haven't talked to him."
1210,Article 1210,MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you believe that that means you are a target?
1212,Article 1212,"JAMES COMEY: I can't imagine that I'm a target. I saw the news report that John Brennan-- Brennan was a witness. I-- given that I know what happened during 2016, which was a bunch of people trying to do the right thing consistent with the law, I'm not worried at all about that investigation of the investigation. Next, I'm sure will be an investigation of the investigation of the investigation. They just want to have an investigation to talk about."
1214,Article 1214,"MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about a tweet you sent this week. You sent out a picture of yourself wearing a T-shirt that said, you know, more women should be elected, more votes for women. Of course, it is the-- the week honoring ratification of the 19th Amendment. But it drew this response that we just put up for our viewers from Hillary Clinton, who is just sort of making a smirk. I know she's said in the past that she thought she was on the verge of winning in 2016 until you reopened that e-mail investigation. Do you see this as contradictory? Do you regret what happened then? Because she, clearly, sees this as a contradiction for you to say now."
1216,Article 1216,"JAMES COMEY: Yeah. Look, I think it's pretty funny. And I get why she would send something like that. She's better at Twitter than I am. But I-- I regret only being involved in the 2016 election. We were stuck, and I think we made the right decisions choosing between terrible options. And so I wasn't trying, nor was anybody else in the FBI trying to elect or not elect anyone. And I hope more women get elected to office. I'm proud of that shirt that my daughters and my wife gave me. And I think it's time for more women to be leaders in this country. We'll all be better off."

1232,Article 1232,"MARK STRASSMANN: Dozens of schools already have reversed plans. They've switched undergraduates to all virtual classrooms, and offered a course in consequences. Syracuse suspended twenty-three partiers; Purdue, thirty-six; St. Olaf in Minnesota, seventeen; North Carolina State University has had multiple COVID clusters."
1234,Article 1234,"DR. RANDY WOODSON (Chancellor, NC State University): We've seen behaviors off-campus that, frankly, are inconsistent with our community standards and have-- have had an impact on our ability to go forward."
1236,Article 1236,"MARK STRASSMANN: But human nature's always the X factor, and fingers crossed is a poor COVID defense. Students have blamed administrators for poor planning. At Notre Dame, three hundred seventy-two people have tested positive. The student paper's front-page editorial ""Don't make us write obituaries."" Across America, fewer people are dying from COVID. Death rates are down or flat in thirty-eight states and up in twelve. A month ago deaths were up in twenty-six states. But America's Heartland has more COVID troubles. Rising cases in twelve states, including North Dakota, Wyoming, Kansas, and Missouri. South Dakota's average daily case loads are up fifty-eight percent.

1252,Article 1252,"MARGARET BRENNAN: New cases have dropped below fifty thousand for about the eighth day. That seems, according to Johns Hopkins, a positive development. But the CDC director says it's really middle America that's getting stuck. Where do you think we are?"
1254,Article 1254,"SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Well, we're seeing some signs of good news here. We're seeing cases fall across the country, across the Sun Belt, where the epidemic was. We're seeing deaths start to fall, and I think we're going to see deaths fall below a thousand a day. They've been persistently at above a thousand a day now for almost four weeks. And we're seeing hospitalizations fall, which is probably the most important indicator to watch. They fell below forty thousand for the first time in a very long time. And this is being driven by declines in the Sun Belt where the coronavirus really was epidemic, the sort of second wave, if you will, of the epidemic, the first being located in the New York Tri-State region. But we're seeing more cases build in the Midwest and the West. And the concern is that if there is sort of a third wave, a third iteration of the national epidemic, it could be more diffuse spread across a broader section of the Midwest and the West, because cases are building in those parts of the country. And that's what's concerning people right now."
1256,Article 1256,"MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about some of the things that the President has said regarding your old agency, the FDA. Yesterday, he posted a tweet that I want to show our viewers. He said ""The deep state, or whoever, over at the FDA is making it very difficult for drug companies to get people in order to test the vaccines and therapeutics. They're hoping to delay the answer until after November 3rd. Most-- must focus on speed."" It sounds like the President is directly accusing the FDA of political motivations. What is he talking about?"
1258,Article 1258,"SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Well, I'm not sure exactly what he's talking about, but I can tell you about my direct experience at the agency. I served in that agency three times, twice under President Bush and once as the commissioner for two years under President Trump. And when it comes to regulatory decision-making in that agency, it's a foundational truth that guides that agency as science and a deeply seated sense of public health mission that permeates that agency. It's a part of the esprit de corps of the staff of that agency. And I know that they know the urgency of the moment. They put out sixty guidance documents to find new ways to bring products to the market more quickly. There are seven hundred and fifty drugs under mid or late stages of clinical development, clinical trials right now. So I firmly reject the idea that they would slow walk anything or accelerate anything for that matter, based on any kind of political consideration and any consideration other than what's best for the public health and a real sense of mission to patients."
1260,Article 1260,MARGARET BRENNAN: Well--
1262,Article 1262,SCOTT GOTTLIEB: As for the clinical trials they-- please.
1264,Article 1264,"MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the-- the chief of staff to the President doubled down on that today. He says sometimes you have to make them feel the heat if they do not see the light. He said a number of bureaucrats don't see the urgency. What urgency? What-- what-- what is the FDA being pressured to do?"
1266,Article 1266,"SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Well, look, I-- I think a lot of that was about plasma, that tweet, I think the President scoped into that tweet a comment on vaccines. But I will tell you and I sit on the board of Pfizer, one of the two U.S. companies furthest along and developing a vaccine, the vaccine trials have-- have enrolled very fast. Moderna and Pfizer, the two U.S. manufacturers who are the furthest ahead, enrolled twenty-five thousand patients into those trials in the four weeks that those trials have been stood up and they've really only been enrolling in earnest for three weeks. That's extraordinary. So to say that these products aren't moving at really historic pace I think is wrong. The-- there were delays or perceived delays in bringing plasma, authorizing plasma under an emergency use authorization, was reported this week that NIH had misgivings about FDA going forward with that authorization. But there's reasons people have some questions about that. The trial that that's going to be based on, seventy thousand patients, wasn't a very rigorously done trial. It was an open-label study where everyone got treated. So it's hard to draw conclusions. I believe plasma is probably beneficial. It's probably weakly beneficial in the setting of this treatment. But I think some people wanted to see more rigorous data to ground that decision. And I think that's part of what is going on here with respect to that tweet and questions about the FDA decision making."
1268,Article 1268,MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay.
1270,Article 1270,SCOTT GOTTLIEB: But I think the FDA is on firm ground taking their time to try to closely evaluate that information.
1272,Article 1272,MARGARET BRENNAN: The Pre-- the White House has said there will be a major therapeutic breakthrough on the virus announced today. Do you know what that is?
1274,Article 1274,"SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Well, I would guess it's the emergency use authorization for plasma. You know, the-- the issue here, though, is that patients are getting it. More than seventy thousand patients, again, have been dosed with that. So it's available. What the emergency use authorization will allow is probably more commercial distribution, and it will allow manufacturers of plasma products to more easily recoup the costs. Now, what plasma is is basically taking the antibodies from people who've recovered, so it's a blood product, and infusing them in people who are sick. And if you use it early enough in the course of the disease, there is some precedent for it being beneficial in the treatment of viruses. And so it is a good therapeutic to have in the overall armamentarium. But the bottom line is it's widely available right now, patients are getting it."
1276,Article 1276,MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.
1278,Article 1278,"SCOTT GOTTLIEB: The EUA, the emergency use authorization, will enable probably easier access in certain settings, but it's incremental, and you know, incremental gains--"

1284,Article 1284,"MARGARET BRENNAN: Quickly, before we let you go, I want to understand this study that came out this week showing from the Journal of Pediatrics that children have a more significant role in community spread than-- than believed initially. Does this mean kids are more contagious than we thought?"
1286,Article 1286,"SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Well, I think this study was consistent with other studies. What it showed-- it was nasopharyngeal swabs, so it was swabs from children comparing them to swabs from adults. There was some problems with this study in that they were swabbing the kids early in the course of the disease, comparing them to adults who were swabbed late in the course of the disease, albeit adults who are very sick, who were hospitalized. And they found that the kids had very high viral levels, in many cases higher than the adults. I think it confirms what other-- other studies have shown, which is that children do shed virus and they can transmit the virus. If they can't transmit the virus, we wouldn't be seeing these outbreaks in day camps in Missouri and Georgia. We saw the situation in Ohio where there was an outbreak in a church service and children were in the chain of transmission. So children can transmit the virus. The presumption is that when they're asymptomatic, they're less likely to transmit it. And that's true of adults too. The CDC says that when adults are asymptomatic, they're also less likely to transmit the infection."

1298,Article 1298,"MARGARET BRENNAN: Sure. How many students are coming back for in-person, in-class instruction, and will all of them be tested?"
1300,Article 1300,"DR. ROBERT ROBBINS: So all of the students that are living in our dormitories are being tested, that's mandatory. We've tested over five thousand students with twenty-six positives, so it's about 0.3 percent. The other students that are living off-campus are being strongly encouraged to be tested. And in total, there'll be about five thousand students that will be taking essential courses face to face, in person. Those would be things like organic chemistry lab, physics lab, gross anatomy lab, those kind of things. And we think we're going to have about thirty thousand, twenty-eight to thirty thousand students coming back to the Tucson area. Normally, we would have forty-five thousand."
1302,Article 1302,MARGARET BRENNAN: And your office told us that the only mandate for testing is for those living on campus. You just mentioned dorms there.
1304,Article 1304,DR. ROBERT ROBBINS: Right. Yes.
1306,Article 1306,MARGARET BRENNAN: It looks like five thousand of your students live in dorms. That-- that means the majority don't live on campus. So-- so isn't this exposing everyone if you can't mandate testing for those who don't live in a dorm?
1308,Article 1308,"DR. ROBERT ROBBINS: Well, I think-- I think that what we're going to do is we will try to test everyone that comes on campus. What I would like, and, of course, what we would all like is a ten second-- ten-cent test that we could test everyone every day. We-- we think that we can test everybody who comes back to campus in person, but we can't test them every day using an antigen test, which is what we're using to look at our students that are coming into-- to the dorms. We-- we think that we've got a random testing protocol that we've got in place, but I would like to see us test at least once a week everybody who comes on campus face to face."
1310,Article 1310,MARGARET BRENNAN: So Notre Dame mandated testing for students on campus. And I'm sure you know that they have had an outbreak–

1316,Article 1316,"DR. ROBERT ROBBINS: Well, I think that we've got extensive testing policies. I think they did the same thing that we did, which is test students when they came into the dorms, but I'm not sure if they were tested-- because they'd only been in class, just like at UNC Chapel Hill, they'd only been in class for a week or so. I think the big issue is off-campus activity."
1318,Article 1318,MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.
1320,Article 1320,"DR. ROBERT ROBBINS: I think we all know that we can control things in the classroom and on campus and in the student union and not having large gatherings of people on campus in official venues. The problem is, what I've seen is that others such as Kansas, even Arizona State, other universities, Purdue, have gone aggressively off campus to try to break up large gatherings and parties. And that's where most of the transmission has occurred."

We're anticipating there'll be some people who refuse to cover their face because of their expression of their individuality and freedom. But that is going to be-- that'll go through the dean of students and code of conduct. And, yes, they can be expelled. What-- what I think we're moving into is we-- we've done a very good job of testing, contact tracing. We've got COVID-19 Watch, which is a Google Apple app that uses Bluetooth. And we're the first university to use that. So, we feel good about our education. And we've been on with a weekly briefing every week and over social media.

1420,Article 1420,"The 2020 Atlantic hurricane season is racking up storms at breakneck speed. To date, the season is about two weeks ahead of record pace and it's only one third of the way through. On Wednesday, the news became more concerning as the research team at Colorado State University (CSU) — the standard bearer for seasonal forecasts — released the most dire forecast in their 37-year history."
1422,Article 1422,"Labeling the 2020 hurricane season ""extremely active,"" the team is now predicting 24 named storms, including 12 total hurricanes and 5 major hurricanes — each figure about double that of a normal season. If the forecast proves accurate, 2020 would be the second most active Atlantic hurricane season, behind only the record-shattering 2005 season which brought Hurricanes Katrina and Wilma."
1424,Article 1424,"Only 21 storm names are allotted each year because the letters Q, U, X, Y and Z are not used. As a result, if 24 tropical storms are indeed named, the National Hurricane Center will have to employ the Greek alphabet for overflow. This has only happened one time on record — in 2005 when the Atlantic experienced a total of 28 tropical and subtropical storms."

1429,Article 1429,"In addition, CSU is forecasting a 75% chance that the U.S. coast will be struck by a major hurricane — Category 3 or greater — during the 2020 season. This is significant because damage increases exponentially with wind speed. Category 3, 4 and 5 systems cause 85% of all hurricane damage."
1431,Article 1431,"On Thursday, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) upgraded its hurricane forecast as well. NOAA's updated outlook calls for 19 to 25 named storms, of which 7 to 11 will become hurricanes, including 3 to 6 major hurricanes."

""We encourage all Americans to do their part by getting prepared, remaining vigilant, and being ready to take action when necessary."""
1436,Article 1436,"Dr. Phil Klotzbach, the lead forecaster of the CSU team, tells CBS News that because the 2020 season is already on a record pace, and conditions remain ripe for activity, the forecast is not particularly far-fetched."
1439,Article 1439,"""Honestly, forecasting 15 additional named storms isn't that much of a stretch,"" he said. ""The average season in the active era (from 1995-2019) had 12 additional named storms after August 5."""

1449,Article 1449,"Some of the hotter-than-normal water may be driven by the warm phase of a natural cycle called the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), a long-accepted concept of warming and cooling. But the scientist who coined the term decades ago, Dr. Michael Mann of Penn State University, now says that new studies provide little support for this cyclical effect."

1462,Article 1462,"While warm waters and a wet African Sahel would already be enough to make for an active season, there are even more factors tipping the scales this season."
1464,Article 1464,"In July, atmospheric pressures were at record low levels in the Tropical Atlantic. Areas of low pressure go hand in hand with rising air. That rising air is a requirement for thunderstorms — the foundation for tropical storms — to fire up."
1467,Article 1467,"Along with rising air, wind shear, which tends to tear systems apart, is running near record lows this summer."
1470,Article 1470,"One factor that can lead to high wind shear in the Atlantic basin is El Niño. But this summer, there is not only an absence of El Niño, but instead the possibility of the opposite phenomenon: La Niña. La Niña's cooler-than-normal Tropical Pacific waters translates into weak winds in the Atlantic Ocean, a perfect setup for an active hurricane season."
1473,Article 1473,"As all signs point in an ominous direction, there is one bit of good news in the short term. For the next 10 days, the climate pattern in the Atlantic Basin will be unfavorable for development due to a cyclical pattern passing through. This will give residents of hurricane alley a short window of opportunity to prepare."

1815,Article 1815,"Los Angeles — As the clock struck midnight, there were new laws that took effect across the country. The new decade started with a nice bonus for millions of workers."
1817,Article 1817,"Twenty-one states are raising their minimum wage. Florida is raising the state minimum wage $0.10 an hour, while Washington State's minimum wage increased $1.50 to $13.50 an hour."
1819,Article 1819,"In California, gig workers, including rideshare and delivery drivers, are now considered employees, making them eligible for paid sick leave and other benefits.

1839,Article 1839,"January 6, 2020 / 3:53 PM EST / MoneyWatch"
1842,Article 1842,"As investors assess the threat of increasingly hostile relations between the U.S. and Iran, Eurasia Group says the conflict isn't the biggest threat facing global economic and political stability this year. Instead, the top risk in 2020 is likely to be America's politics."
1844,Article 1844,"""It's the first time in history of our firm that a domestic political risk is No. 1,"" said Ian Bremmer, president of the political risk consultancy, in a conference call to discuss the geopolitical advisory firm's annual risk-assessment forecast. The firm started in 1998, he noted."
1846,Article 1846,"At the heart of the issue is the November presidential election, with Bremmer predicting that many Americans will view the results as illegitimate no matter the outcome. The Senate is likely to acquit President Donald Trump in his forthcoming impeachment trial, heightening political tensions in an already polarized nation, he added. In a close election this fall, the losing side will claim the results were ""rigged,"" leading to instability and legal challenges, Bremmer said."
1848,Article 1848,"""Meaningful [France-style] social discontent becomes more likely in that environment, as does domestic, politically inspired violence,"" Eurasia Group wrote in an analysis issued on Monday."
1850,Article 1850,"In addition, legislation could stall because of what the firm called a ""non-functioning Congress,"" adding to mounting problems if the economy slows down, according to the Eurasia report."
1853,Article 1853,China headwinds
1854,Article 1854,"The second biggest risk for 2020 is one that has been in the headlines throughout the past year, according to Eurasia: The decision by China to reduce its technological dependence on the U.S. following Mr. Trump's trade war with the country."
1856,Article 1856,"""Caught off-guard by U.S. actions, President Xi Jinping has called for a new 'Long March' to break China's technological dependence on the U.S.,"" the report noted. ""At the same time, China will expand efforts to reshape international technology, trade and financial architecture to better promote its interests in an increasingly bifurcated world."""
1858,Article 1858,"That represents a shift away from decades of globalization, Bremmer said. He added that ""very soon"" the world's largest economy may no longer be America's capitalist system, but China's hybrid of state control and capitalism."
1860,Article 1860,Iran: Not at the top of the list
1861,Article 1861,"The threat of deteriorating U.S.-Iran relations ranks at No. 8, Eurasia Group said. That's partly because Bremmer said his group doesn't believe a full-scale military response will evolve from the U.S. killing of General Qassem Soleimani, the head of Iran's elite Quds military force and one of the most powerful figures in the Islamic Republic."
1864,Article 1864,"""Iran is a committed adversary of the United States but also has a clear understanding of U.S. military power … as well as (now) a better sense of Trump's red lines and deterrence capacity,"" the report noted."
1866,Article 1866,Below is Eurasia Group's list of the top 10 risks for 2020.
1868,Article 1868,"U.S. domestic politics: As noted above, a polarized nation is heading into an election that could be contested by both sides, leading to legislative and economic challenges."

1871,Article 1871,"The waning influence of multinational companies: Regulatory and trade restrictions will lessen big companies' ability to generate wealth, growth and jobs."
1872,Article 1872,"Pressure on India's Narendra Modi: Sectarian and religious conflicts are growing in India, which is facing a precarious fiscal situation."
1873,Article 1873,"The European Union pulls away: The EU is growing more independent, which creates regulatory and economic risks for other countries."
1874,Article 1874,"The politics versus economics of climate change: Political solutions to climate change aren't working, which increases the risks of economic disruptions and political instability."
1875,Article 1875,"Tensions with Iran and the Middle East: ""U.S. policy toward the major Shia-led nations in the Middle East is failing,"" increasing the risks of regional instability and higher gas prices, Eurasia Group said."
1876,Article 1876,Latin America's instability: Citizens in Latin American countries are angry about issues ranging from corruption to low-quality public services. That and other pressures are increasing risks across the region.
1877,Article 1877,"Turkey: ""President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has entered a period of steep political decline ... This year, his weakness will lead him to lash out. The response will further damage Turkey's already ailing economy,"" the group predicted."

1883,Article 1883,"December 22, 2020 / 4:31 AM EST / AP"
1886,Article 1886,"This is the deadliest year in U.S. history, with deaths expected to top 3 million for the first time — due mainly to the coronavirus pandemic. Final mortality data for this year won't be available for months, but preliminary numbers suggest the United States is on track to see more than 3.2 million deaths this year, or at least 400,000 more than in 2019."
1888,Article 1888,"U.S. deaths increase most years, so some annual rise in fatalities is expected. But the 2020 numbers amount to a jump of about 15% and could go higher once all the deaths from this month are counted."
1890,Article 1890,"That would mark the largest single-year percentage leap since 1918, when tens of thousands of U.S. soldiers died in World War I and hundreds of thousands of Americans died in a flu pandemic. Deaths rose 46% that year compared with 1917."
1892,Article 1892,"COVID-19 has killed more than 319,000 Americans and counting. Before it came along, there was reason to be hopeful about U.S. death trends."
1894,Article 1894,"The nation's overall mortality rate fell a bit in 2019, due to reductions in heart disease and cancer deaths. And life expectancy inched up - by several weeks - for the second straight year, according to death certificate data released Tuesday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention."
1896,Article 1896,"But life expectancy for 2020 could end up dropping as much as three full years, said Robert Anderson of the CDC."
1898,Article 1898,"The agency counted 2,854,838 U.S. deaths last year, or nearly 16,000 more than 2018. That's fairly good news: Deaths usually rise by about 20,000 to 50,000 each year, mainly due to the nation's aging, and growing, population."
1900,Article 1900,"Indeed, the age-adjusted death rate dropped about 1% in 2019, and life expectancy rose by about six weeks to 78.8 years, the CDC reported."
1902,Article 1902,"""It was actually a pretty good year for mortality, as things go,"" said Anderson, who oversees CDC death statistics."
1904,Article 1904,"The U.S. coronavirus epidemic has been a big driver of deaths this year, both directly and indirectly."
1906,Article 1906,"The virus was first identified in China last year, and the first U.S. cases were reported this year. But it has become the third leading cause of death, behind only heart disease and cancer. For certain periods this year, COVID-19 was the No. 1 killer."
1908,Article 1908,But some other types of deaths also have increased.
1910,Article 1910,"A burst of pneumonia cases early this year may have been COVID-19 deaths that simply weren't recognized as such early in the epidemic. But there also have been an unexpected number of deaths from certain types of heart and circulatory diseases, diabetes and dementia, Anderson said."
1912,Article 1912,"Many of those, too, may be related to COVID. The virus could have weakened patients already struggling with those conditions, or could have diminished the care they were getting, he said."
1914,Article 1914,"Early in the epidemic, some were optimistic that car crash deaths would drop as people stopped commuting or driving to social events. Data on that is not yet in, but anecdotal reports suggest there was no such decline."
1916,Article 1916,"Suicide deaths dropped in 2019 compared with 2018, but early information suggests they have not continued to drop this year, Anderson and others said."
1918,Article 1918,"Drug overdose deaths, meanwhile, got much worse."
1920,Article 1920,"Before the coronavirus even arrived, the U.S. was in the midst of the deadliest drug overdose epidemic in its history."
1922,Article 1922,"Data for all of 2020 is not yet available. But the CDC reported last week that there were more than 81,000 drug overdose deaths in the 12 months ending in May, making it the highest number ever recorded in a one-year period."
1924,Article 1924,Experts think the pandemic's disruption to in-person treatment and recovery services may have been a factor. People also are more likely to be taking drugs alone - without the benefit of a friend or family member who can call 911 or administer overdose-reversing medication.
1926,Article 1926,"But perhaps a bigger factor are the drugs themselves: COVID-19 caused supply problems for dealers, so they are increasingly mixing cheap and deadly fentanyl into heroin, cocaine and methamphetamine, experts said."
1928,Article 1928,"""I don't suspect there are a bunch of new people who suddenly started using drugs because of COVID. If anything, I think the supply of people who are already using drugs is more contaminated,"" said Shannon Monnat, a Syracuse University researcher who studies drug overdose trends."

1939,Article 1939,"Washington — Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro is dropping out of the presidential race, he announced in a video released by his campaign on Thursday."
1941,Article 1941,"""With only a month before the Iowa caucuses, and given the circumstances of this campaign season, I have determined that it simply isn't our time,"" Castro said in the video. ""So today it is with a heavy heart and profound gratitude that I will suspend my campaign for president."""
1944,Article 1944,"Castro, who served as mayor of San Antonio for five years before joining the Obama administration in 2014, struggled to find a foothold in a crowded Democratic primary field and lagged behind other candidates in terms of fundraising. In November, the campaign eliminated field offices in New Hampshire and South Carolina, and Castro failed to meet the threshold to appear at the most recent debate in December."
1946,Article 1946,"Castro, the only Latino candidate in the race, focused his campaign on issues like immigration, poverty and police brutality. In the video announcing the end of his campaign, Castro stressed his advocacy for the ""most vulnerable folks in this country"" and referenced the names of several black Americans killed by police officers in recent years."
1948,Article 1948,"His campaign noted he was the first candidate to travel to Puerto Rico as part of his campaign, and the first to publicly support opening an impeachment inquiry against President Trump."
1950,Article 1950,"In perhaps the most memorable moment of his bid, Castro clashed with former Vice President Joe Biden over health care during a debate in September. In a heated exchange, Castro suggested repeatedly that Biden had forgotten what he had just said. ""Are you forgetting what you said two minutes ago?"" Castro asked, a thinly veiled reference to Biden's gaffes that critics have attributed to his age."
1952,Article 1952,"Castro was reportedly on the short list to be Hillary Clinton's pick for vice president in 2016, and could once again be among those considered as a running mate for the eventual Democratic nominee in 2020. Reacting to his decision to drop out, Senator Elizabeth Warren called Castro a ""powerful voice"" who ""will continue to be a leader in our party and our country for many years to come."""
1954,Article 1954,"Castro's announcement on Thursday comes as other Democratic candidates announced huge fundraising hauls in the fourth quarter of 2019. Pete Buttigieg announced that his campaign raised $24.7 million in the fourth quarter, while Bernie Sanders raised $34 million."
1956,Article 1956,"The video announcing his departure ends with Castro saying ""ganaremos un día,"" or, ""we will win one day."""

2043,Article 2043,By Kate Gibson
2045,Article 2045,"Updated on: December 12, 2018 / 11:23 AM EST / MoneyWatch"
2048,Article 2048,"Considering that major corporations have been busy shedding workers, it follows that corporate finance leaders see a U.S. recession ahead. Evidence of a slowing economy has been popping up, including recent large-scale cuts in head count by U.S. corporations such as General Motors and Verizon."
2050,Article 2050,"Eighty-two percent of chief financial officers polled believe a recession will have started by the end 2020, and nearly 49 percent think the downturn will arrive sometime next year, according to the Duke University/CFO Global Business Outlook, released Wednesday."
2052,Article 2052,"""The end is near for the near-decade-long burst of global economic growth,"" said John Graham, a finance professor at Duke's Fuqua School of Business and director of the survey. ""The U.S. outlook has declined, and moreover the outlook is even worse in many other parts of the world, which will lead to softer demand for U.S. goods."""
2054,Article 2054,"Worst-case projections would see capital spending drop in 2019, accompanied by flat hiring, found the survey conducted Friday of more than 500 CFOs, including 226 from North America."
2056,Article 2056,Global agreement
2057,Article 2057,"CFOs were also pessimistic in other regions of the world, especially in Africa, where 97 percent said they believe their countries will be in recession no later than year-end 2019, the survey found."
2059,Article 2059,"""CFOs are getting ready for a recession in the next 18 months,"" said Campbell Harvey, a founding director of the survey and technology innovation professor at Fuqua. ""All of the ingredients are in place: a waning expansion that began in June 2009 -- almost a decade ago -- heightened market volatility, the impact of growth-reducing protectionism and the ominous flattening of the yield curve, which has predicted recessions accurately over the past 50 years."""
2062,Article 2062,"The Duke findings align with other signals indicating that some companies are girding for a slowdown. More than a half-million U.S. workers have been laid off so far this year, a 28 percent higher pace than this time last year, according to consultancy Challenger Gray & Christmas."
2064,Article 2064,"A gloomy forecast could also be heard in recent corporate explanations of cutbacks. GM Chairman and CEO Mary Barra said the automaker opted to close five plants and lay off tens of thousands of workers to ""stay in front of market conditions."""
2066,Article 2066,Glass half-full
2067,Article 2067,"Yet some economists give decidedly different odds of a recession hitting, at least in 2019. Oxford Economics' bond market-influenced ""yield-curve model"" puts the odds of a recession around 15 percent during the next 12 months, the firm said in a research note.

2473,Article 2473,By Camilo Montoya-Galvez
2475,Article 2475,"June 12, 2019 / 3:06 PM EDT / CBS News"
2478,Article 2478,"Washington — Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rosselló is spearheading an effort to move up the date of the island's 2020 Democratic primary to highlight the pressing issues facing the U.S. territory, which some progressives worry are being neglected on the campaign trail."
2480,Article 2480,"The measure, which is expected to pass the island's legislature in the coming weeks, would move the primary from the first Sunday in June to the last Sunday in March. Rosselló said the change would incentivize the two-dozen Democrats running for president to actively address proposals to remedy some of the island's woes, including stalled hurricane recovery efforts and a prolonged fiscal crisis."
2482,Article 2482,"""You have a platform there in Puerto Rico to really zero in. It can be kind of the ground zero of the discussions of some of the issues that are important for the Democratic candidates,"" the governor told CBS News during an exclusive interview in Washington. ""And I hope — and I expect — others to come to the island."""
2484,Article 2484,"If the measure passes as expected, Rosselló said Democratic presidential campaigns will make more an effort to win over the state's delegates. In 2016, Puerto Rico had 67 Democratic delegates in play, more than than over two dozen states and territories."
2486,Article 2486,The governor is also pushing the Democratic National Committee (DNC) to hold a presidential debate in Puerto Rico and said a formal request will be forthcoming.

2490,Article 2490,Dennis M. Rivera / AP
2491,Article 2491,"Rosselló said Puerto Rico — home to approximately 3.2 million U.S. citizens — can serve as a microcosm of issues that affect the entire nation but that are particularly pronounced on the island. ""These issues that are important to all of the candidates that resonate in Iowa, in New Hampshire, in California and elsewhere, they resonate in Puerto Rico,"" he added."
2493,Article 2493,"The governor said the ""extreme"" economic inequality on the island — which is the highest of any U.S. state or territory, based on the most widely recognized measure of income inequality — can help candidates highlight the issue of wealth disparity across the country."
2495,Article 2495,"On climate change, Rosselló said Puerto Rico can become a ""model"" for national efforts to reduce carbon emissions and expand renewable energy. He said the Caribbean island, unlike most areas in the mainland U.S., has felt the brunt of human-induced climate change by way of rising sea levels, severe droughts and powerful storms, like the pair that pummeled the U.S. territory in 2017."
2497,Article 2497,"Rosselló, an ardent supporter of Puerto Rican statehood, also believes the island represents the most compelling example of voter disenfranchisement in the U.S."
2499,Article 2499,"U.S. citizens in Puerto Rico can't vote in the general presidential election, as the island does not have electoral votes, unlike the District of Columbia, which also lacks voting representation in Congress but was granted electoral votes under the 23rd Amendment. Puerto Ricans who move to the mainland and register, however, can cast ballots in general elections."
2501,Article 2501,"Under the 1979 Guaranteed Presidential Vote U.S. citizens in Puerto Rico Act, U.S. citizens on the island can vote in party primaries."
2503,Article 2503,"""What better place to sort of highlight the effects of voter disenfranchisement than in Puerto Rico where you have 3.2 million U.S. citizens that are just disenfranchised?"" Rosselló asked."

2515,Article 2515,"MARGARET BRENNAN: Joining us now is Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at NIH. Dr. Fauci, it's good to have you here."
2517,Article 2517,DR. ANTHONY FAUCI: Good to be with you.
2519,Article 2519,MARGARET BRENNAN: We were just hearing about the State Department sending planes to help evacuate some of these Americans who were on that cruise ship. Debora said more than 40 now. What can you tell us in terms of the Americans have been exposed and infected?
2521,Article 2521,"DR. FAUCI: Well, 40 of them have gotten infected. They are not going to go anywhere. They're going to be in hospitals in Japan. People who have symptoms will not be able to get on the evacuation plane. Others are going to be evacuated starting imminently to Air Force bases in the United States. If people on the plane start to develop symptoms, they'll be segregated within the plane. So there's a very firm plan with this 747 that is going to take these passengers now who have been there. If you want to stay in Japan, your last chance would be to get on the plane and leave or you stay there. When you come back to the United States, importantly, they're still subjected to a 14 day quarantine. And the reason for that is that the degree of transmissibility on that cruise ship is essentially akin to being in a hot spot. A lot of transmissibility on that cruise ship."
2523,Article 2523,"MARGARET BRENNAN: So for the Americans who are infected, what does that actually mean? What is the state of their health?"
2525,Article 2525,"DR. FAUCI: Yeah, well, it varies. I mean, you could be infected and have minimal symptoms, but you still have the possibility of transmitting it to someone else."
2527,Article 2527,MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.
2529,Article 2529,DR. FAUCI: Or you could be infected and have some significant lung disease that would require hospitalization and perhaps even some serious intervention.
2531,Article 2531,"MARGARET BRENNAN: Now, Malaysian health authorities have also said there was an 83 year old American woman who had been on a different cruise ship which ended up docking in Cambodia. She landed in Malaysia and then tested positive. This kind of spread, does this indicate this is becoming a pandemic?"
2533,Article 2533,"DR. FAUCI: Well, a pandemic is when you have multiple countries throughout the world that have what's called sustained transmission from person to person to person, multiple generations. Right now, there are 24 countries in which there were over five hundred cases. Several of them are starting to get to the second and third transmission. So technically speaking, the WHO wouldn't be calling this a global pandemic, but it certainly is on the verge of that happening reasonably soon unless containment is more successful than it is right now."
2535,Article 2535,"MARGARET BRENNAN: As Debora said, there are experts landing in China this week."
2537,Article 2537,DR. FAUCI: Right.
2539,Article 2539,MARGARET BRENNAN: Americans will be among them.

2547,Article 2547,"MARGARET BRENNAN: --if, say, the CDC had been allowed in--"
2549,Article 2549,DR. FAUCI: Right.
2551,Article 2551,MARGARET BRENNAN: --versus the WHO?
2553,Article 2553,"DR. FAUCI: You know, MARGARET, to be honest with you, we really should not be talking about that because the sensitivity of coming out ahead of the Chinese of making any kind of announcement. But you're correct, there certainly--"
2555,Article 2555,MARGARET BRENNAN: But the Chinese ambassador was on this program last week and he indicated Americans were on that list.
2557,Article 2557,"DR. FAUCI: Well, then if he says it, then they're on that list. Yes."
2559,Article 2559,MARGARET BRENNAN: But- but what is the difference there? Why would it be more beneficial to have--
2561,Article 2561,"DR. FAUCI: Well, for two reasons--"
2563,Article 2563,"MARGARET BRENNAN: --your agency be able to send people, have CDC officials there?"
2565,Article 2565,"DR. FAUCI: Well, the reason is because first of all, this- our CDC are the best epidemiologists in the world. They can be helpful to the Chinese as well as get information firsthand, eyes, ears and boots on the ground. So it really is to be helpful as part of the WHO group."
2567,Article 2567,"MARGARET BRENNAN: Because the WHO has been criticized, perhaps being too careful around the Chinese government in their part of the U.N. agency. They receive international funding. China has tremendous power over them. Is that criticism fair?"
2569,Article 2569,"DR. FAUCI: You know, I don't know if it's fair or not, but certainly it's been spoken about. I mean, clearly, the director of WHO, Dr. Tedros, is really an outstanding person. And under very difficult circumstances, I think he's doing a very good job."
2571,Article 2571,MARGARET BRENNAN: The president has said at least twice so far that the virus could tick down in these warmer months ahead. He indicated--
2573,Article 2573,DR. FAUCI: Right.
2575,Article 2575,MARGARET BRENNAN: --President Xi told him that.
2577,Article 2577,DR. FAUCI: Right.
2579,Article 2579,MARGARET BRENNAN: Is that how the virus actually works?
2581,Article 2581,"DR. FAUCI: This virus, we don't know. But it is not unreasonable to say that influenza, for example, which peaks in the winter, you would certainly expect it by March, April and May to taper down, as well as typical common cold coronaviruses. That's not an unreasonable statement. However, we do not know what this particular virus is gonna do so. So we would think it would be a stretch to assume that it's going to disappear with the warm weather. We don't know that. It's completely unknown."
2583,Article 2583,MARGARET BRENNAN: You said recently that you could have some kind of vaccine within a year or so.
2585,Article 2585,"DR. FAUCI: Right, right."
2587,Article 2587,"MARGARET BRENNAN: How do you speed up that timeline and how do you fix the problem you said you have, which is finding a manufacturer?"
2589,Article 2589,"DR. FAUCI: Right. Well, first of all, MARGARET, that one year timeline would be the world's indoor record of ever getting a vaccine out, at least to be able to early deploy. You can't do any better than that. If you go any faster, you'll be cutting dangerous corners."
2591,Article 2591,"MARGARET BRENNAN: And no manufacturer, yet?"
2593,Article 2593,"DR. FAUCI: Oh yeah manufacturers. Once you get a vaccine that, you know works, the difficulty is having companies take that risk of hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars to scale up to make it available."
2595,Article 2595,MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. So you're still looking for a partner on that?
2597,Article 2597,DR. FAUCI: I think we're gonna get them--
2599,Article 2599,MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.
2601,Article 2601,DR. FAUCI: --because I'm seeing interest on the part of pharmaceutical companies that we did not see with SARS and other outbreaks.

2673,Article 2673,"""We seem to be migrating to, on the one camp, sort of nostalgia — let's just get rid, if you will, of the incumbent president and we can go back to doing what we used to do,"" he said. ""Or, you know, it's our way, our big idea, or no way. And neither of those, it seems to me, seizes the moment to pull the nation together."""
2675,Article 2675,"Patrick, 63, said on ""CBS This Morning"" in June, that it would be hard to ""break though"" the field of Democrats ""without being a celebrity or sensationalist."" However, on Thursday, he said ""you can't know if you can break through if you don't get out there and try."" Making his announcement less than three months before the Iowa caucus, he said his life experiences help him relate to struggling Americans today."

2679,Article 2679,"""I've been waiting for a moment like this my whole life,"" he said. ""I don't mean a moment to run for president but a moment when the appetite for big ideas is big enough for the size of the challenges we face in America."""

2683,Article 2683,"""I think a wealth tax is — makes a lot of sense directionally. My idea would be a much, much simpler tax system for everyone where we eliminate all or most of the deductions and we smooth out and simplify the system we have,"" he said."

On January 20, 2017, the day of President Donald Trump's inauguration, the index closed at 19,827. The S&P 500, which ended Thursday at 2,398, is just 227 points above its level when Mr. Trump formally took office."
2708,Article 2708,"The decline is noteworthy for its speed, with the losses mounting over the course of four weeks. The Dow had hit an all-time record on February 12, a little over a month ago, with the S&P and Nasdaq peaking a week later."
2711,Article 2711,"The widening pandemic, which has led to at least 109 deaths in the U.S., is prompting cities and states across the U.S. to order residents to stay home and to shut restaurants and bars and other gathering places.

The U.S. is likely already in a recession, according to Oxford Economics."

2736,Article 2736,"Wall Street firms are increasingly advising their clients to prepare for a ""Blue Wave"" of victories in next month's national election. Such an outcome would land Joe Biden in the White House and give Democrats a majority in both chambers of Congress."
2738,Article 2738,"In the past month, at least five of Wall Street's top strategists have sent reports to investors predicting a Democratic sweep. Goldman Sachs told clients in a research note earlier this week that the odds of Biden winning the presidency and Democrats gaining a majority in the Senate is roughly 65%. Analysts with the investment bank pointed out that stock prices have been rising since September, coinciding with political polls tilting increasingly toward Biden."
2740,Article 2740,"Goldman also wrote that stocks and other investments that tend to rise when investors expect more inflation have lead the market higher since mid-September. This ""reinflation trade,"" as it is called on Wall Street, is being fueled in part by expectations that a Blue Wave next month will increase the likelihood of lawmakers approving another major round of federal spending on unemployment benefits, cash payments for Americans and other stimulus measures."
2742,Article 2742,"Jason Draho, a strategist at UBS, told clients last week that markets were starting to price in a ""Blue Wave outcome."" That consensus, which has hardened over the last month, is emerging despite a recognition on Wall Street that the political polls showing Biden well ahead of President Donald Trump could be misleading — just as the polls largely failed to predict Mr. Trump's victory four years ago."
2744,Article 2744,"""The level of conviction that Hillary Clinton would win was high as well,"" Draho told CBS MoneyWatch. ""But there is less confidence in the polls this time around, and I don't remember the possibility of a Blue Wave being part of the conversation in 2016."""
2746,Article 2746,"Citigroup's top strategist, Tobias Levkovitz, also puts the odds of a Biden win at 65%. And earlier this week, Morgan Stanley's top U.S. stock strategist, Mike Wilson, said in a podcast published on the financial firm's website that investors now expect a ""blue sweep."""
2748,Article 2748,"Prediction markets, where people wager on who'll prevail on Election Day, also foresee a win for Democrats. According to the Iowa Election Market, which is maintained by the University of Iowa, Biden has a 77% chance of winning. The likelihood that Democrats will gain control of both the House and Senate is 60%, according to the market."
2750,Article 2750,"Although stock market strategists are generally cautious in forecasting how a change in presidential administrations could affect financial markets, a number of Wall Street analysts have recently sought to reassure investors about the potential impact of a Biden win and a clean sweep for Democrats."
2752,Article 2752,"""The consensus view is that a Democrat victory in November will be a negative for equities. However, we see this outcome as neutral to slightly positive,"" said Dubravko Lakos, a top strategist at JPMorgan Chase, in a recent report."
2754,Article 2754,Betting on more federal spending
2755,Article 2755,"The main reason investors appear sanguine: spending. Biden's economic blueprint would significantly boost government expenditures, which economists say is necessary to speed the country's recovery from the pandemic. Most market strategists also seem to think investors would welcome a larger stimulus package now even if that meant adding to the national debt, and possibly higher taxes in the future."

2801,Article 2801,"MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. We turn now to former FDA commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb. He joins us from outside his home in Connecticut. Doctor, good to have you back with us."
2803,Article 2803,DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Thanks.
2805,Article 2805,"MARGARET BRENNAN: You've been talking to Congress. You talked to the administration. And you've been clear that you believe there was a failure to plan in January for March. And you're saying now, in March, we need to be looking ahead and planning for May. Exactly what is it that all of us need to be planning for?"
2807,Article 2807,"DR. GOTTLIEB: Well, right now, we're engaging in broad based population based mitigation techniques, things like stay at home orders, closing schools. These are population level techniques to try to break off chains of transmission. That's the right thing to do in cities like San Francisco and New York, where we see hotspots, where we see epidemic spread. Unfortunately, we're not engaging in those tactics across the whole country. There should be some form of mitigation across the whole country because we're all at risk. But we need to start thinking about how we transition away from that. Come April, come May, when the epidemic curve starts coming down, we can't just take our foot off the brake immediately. We need to start it- start including and introducing what we call case based interventions, trying to do mass screening and identify people who either are infected or who've been in close contact with people who've been infected and go towards more of an individual person approach rather than a population level approach. That planning needs to be underway right now. We need to know how we're going to slowly transition into another paradigm. It's not a question of either or. It's a question of substituting in other techniques that are less intrusive to- for what we're doing now."
2809,Article 2809,MARGARET BRENNAN: You heard Dr. Fauci say there's no doubt we're going to get hit. He mentioned New York. There are some projections from New York hospitals that a peak could hit within the next 20 days. What is it that Americans need to be prepared for?
2811,Article 2811,"DR. GOTTLIEB: Well, I think that the scenes out of New York are going to be shocking. I think that the hospitals in the next two weeks are going to be at the brink of being overwhelmed and we're going to start to see places like Javits Convention Center and other facilities used to start to house people. They're going to start getting thousands of admissions coming into that city. And this was infection that started two weeks ago. The time to hospitalization is nine to 12 days. I think there's other cities that are at extreme risk. New Orleans is at very high risk and they're not taking appropriate measures. This is a sticky virus. We're learning that much more of the transmission probably happens from touching contaminated surfaces. So any city that has a mass transit system is probably at risk and needs to be taking very aggressive steps. Cities like Chicago, San Francisco, New York, Boston. You've seen San Francisco implement tough measures."
2813,Article 2813,MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.
2815,Article 2815,DR. GOTTLIEB: Illinois recently implemented tough measures. We need to continue that right now.
2817,Article 2817,MARGARET BRENNAN: Is there an existing antiviral drug that is effective and- in at least containing this or preventing someone from getting seriously ill?
2819,Article 2819,"DR. GOTTLIEB: No, there's drugs that look promising, there's drugs that are in- in proper trials. We really need to continue to conduct research to figure out what works. Right now, there is no drug that looks like it's proven so overwhelming in early stage clinical trials that we can say it's highly promising. There's drugs that suggest that they may have activity against this virus. But the other question is, when you introduce the drug, sometimes when you introduce an antiviral drug late in the course of the disease, after people are in the critical care unit and very sick, it may not provide a benefit. Sometimes you have to introduce an antiviral drug earlier. And that's how we treat the flu, for example, with drugs like Tamiflu. We introduced them earlier in the course of the illness and that's where they have the greatest benefit."
2821,Article 2821,"MARGARET BRENNAN: So you would agree with Dr. Fauci that there needs to be clinical trials of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, which the president said he thinks is already effective?"
2823,Article 2823,"DR. GOTTLIEB: Absolutely, and that may not be the drug that ends up holding to his promise. The study that looked at that drug and showed activity was- was a study that involved about 20 patients and only six in the arm that showed the benefit. And the benefit that they showed was that they decrease the amount of virus in their- in their noses when you did nasal swabs in those patients. So it could very well be that the drug is reducing viral shedding, but having no impact on the clinical course of those patients. So the data on that is very preliminary. What we need to do is what we call a master protocol, where we basically test a lot of drugs at once. We randomize patients to different treatments so everyone gets a treatment if they need it and we figure out which is working the best. That's what we did with Ebola. We came up with some very--"
2825,Article 2825,MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.
2827,Article 2827,DR. GOTTLIEB: --effective treatments against Ebola.
2829,Article 2829,"MARGARET BRENNAN: The Trump administration announced this past week that the first trial through NIH of a vaccine was started out in Seattle. Given the timeline for this, do resources need to be refocused from a vaccine into some of the treatments that- that you are talking about?"
2831,Article 2831,"DR. GOTTLIEB: I think absolutely. We could have a drug, a potential prophylactic drug that could prevent people from getting an infection or even treating infection as early as this summer, especially when you look at some of the approaches where companies are developing antibodies that directly target the virus. I think this is highly promising. We need to be putting a lot of resources into that. Senator Daines introduced a provision in Capitol Hill that may be included in the final package and what it would do is it would basically scale up manufacturing right away for the promising treatments that make it into the government's sanction trials. So that if one ends up working, we're ready to distribute it on a mass scale. You have literally millions of doses available. Now, what's going to happen is a lot of those drugs won't work and we're going to end up throwing away the drug that we manufactured. But I think that's a small price to pay for the benefit of having drug available, if in fact one proves that it's working."
2833,Article 2833,"MARGARET BRENNAN: In other words, tax payers helping to subsidize some of this research immediately. When do you see us being able to plan about going back to normal life?"
2835,Article 2835,"DR. GOTTLIEB: Well, I think it's going to be a slow transition. I think that the epidemic right now that's underway is probably going to peak sometime in April, probably late April and tail off into May and June and hopefully transmission will be broken off in July and August. We need to plan for what we're going to do in the fall to prevent another epidemic and outbreak. But life's never going to be perfectly normal till we get to a vaccine. We're always going to have to implement some measures, but they could be case based measures where we look at individuals and screened very aggressively for the virus and quarantine and isolate individual people rather than quarantining--"
2837,Article 2837,MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.
2839,Article 2839,DR. GOTTLIEB: --mass populations. That's what we need to get to. That's going to be a transition but we can get there. There is light at the end of this tunnel.

2887,Article 2887,"Decision to speed up 2020 census schedule not made by Census Bureau, internal watchdog finds"
2888,Article 2888,By Melissa Quinn
2890,Article 2890,"September 22, 2020 / 9:15 AM EDT / CBS News"
2893,Article 2893,Washington — The Department of Commerce's internal watchdog found that a recent decision to condense the 2020 census schedule was not made by officials within the bureau and warned the shortened schedule for the decennial population count increases the risks to obtaining a complete and accurate count.
2895,Article 2895,"According to the report from the department's inspector general, senior officials at the Census Bureau said they did not know who made the decision to speed up the schedule for the 2020 census. Some, however, ""speculated the decision came from the department, while others thought the decision likely came from the White House."""
2897,Article 2897,"The coronavirus pandemic led the Census Bureau to temporarily suspend certain operations for the 2020 census in March, but in mid-April, the Commerce Department and the Census Bureau said they would be seeking approval from Congress to extend the window for field data collection and self-response to the end of October. If Congress provided the relief, it would allow an additional 120 calendar days for apportionment counts to be delivered to the president, extending the deadline from December 31 to April 30, 2021."
2899,Article 2899,"One senior official with the Census Bureau told the inspector general's office the agency ""got feedback that both sides of both houses of [C]ongress were supportive"" of the proposal, and the report said bureau officials believed ""a statutory extension to the apportionment date would be forthcoming because there was no resistance to the extension."""
2901,Article 2901,"But over the summer months, the Commerce Department's inspector general said the landscape changed, calling into question support for the extensions. The Census Bureau began fielding questions about accelerating field operations and movement in Congress to pass legislation extending the December 31 deadline stalled. The Office of Management and Budget also said it would be requesting additional money for the Census Bureau to ""maintain timely delivery,"" and President Trump issued his memorandum excluding undocumented immigrants from the count used to apportion congressional seats."
2903,Article 2903,"Mr. Trump's order, however, is being challenged in federal courts."
2905,Article 2905,"In early August, after briefing Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross on options for meeting the initial apportionment deadline of December 31, the bureau announced it would be speeding up the schedule for the 2020 census."
2907,Article 2907,"In its review, the inspector general found that the shortened schedule ""increases the risks to the accuracy of the 2020 Census,"" which determines how much communities receive in federal funding and the number of congressional seats each state receives."
2909,Article 2909,"The Census Bureau sets a target to reach 99% of households, and a senior official with the bureau told the inspector general it ""no longer [has] the runway"" of time to correct errors through re-enumeration, which was needed in the 2000 and 2010 Censuses."
2911,Article 2911,"Top bureau officials also said they don't know what will happen if they don't hit the 99% target by September 30, which would allow for delivery of apportionment counts by year's end."

2922,Article 2922,Polamalu spent his entire 12-season career as a safety for the Pittsburgh Steelers.

2958,Article 2958,"93,000 people died of drug overdoses in U.S. during pandemic in 2020: ""A staggering loss of human life"""
2959,Article 2959,"Updated on: July 14, 2021 / 7:01 PM EDT / AP"
2962,Article 2962,"Overdose deaths soared to a record 93,000 last year in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, the U.S. government reported Wednesday."
2964,Article 2964,"That provisional estimate by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention far eclipses the high of about 72,000 drug overdose deaths reached the previous year and amounts to a 29% increase."
2966,Article 2966,"""This is a staggering loss of human life,"" said Brandon Marshall, a Brown University public health researcher who tracks overdose trends."
2968,Article 2968,"The nation was already struggling with its worst overdose epidemic but clearly ""COVID has greatly exacerbated the crisis,"" he added."
2970,Article 2970,"Lockdowns and other pandemic restrictions isolated those with drug addictions and made treatment harder to get, experts said."
2972,Article 2972,"Jordan McGlashen died of a drug overdose in his Ypsilanti, Michigan, apartment last year. He was pronounced dead on May 6, the day before his 39th birthday."
2974,Article 2974,Drug Overdoses Record
2975,Article 2975,"This August 2017 provided by the family shows Jordan McGlashen, left, and his brother, Collin. Jordan died of a drug overdose in his Ypsilanti, Mich, apartment in 2020."
2976,Article 2976,/ AP
2977,Article 2977,"""It was really difficult for me to think about the way in which Jordan died. He was alone, and suffering emotionally and felt like he had to use again,"" said his younger brother, Collin McGlashen, who wrote openly about his brother's addiction in an obituary."
2979,Article 2979,Jordan McGlashen's death was attributed to heroin and fentanyl.
2981,Article 2981,"While prescription painkillers once drove the nation's overdose epidemic, they were supplanted first by heroin and then by fentanyl, a dangerously powerful opioid, in recent years. Fentanyl was developed to treat intense pain from ailments like cancer but has increasing been sold illicitly and mixed with other drugs."
2983,Article 2983,"""What's really driving the surge in overdoses is this increasingly poisoned drug supply,"" said Shannon Monnat, an associate professor of sociology at Syracuse University who researches geographic patterns in overdoses. ""Nearly all of this increase is fentanyl contamination in some way. Heroin is contaminated. Cocaine is contaminated. Methamphetamine is contaminated."""
2985,Article 2985,"There's no current evidence that more Americans started using drugs last year, Monnat said. Rather, the increased deaths most likely were people who had already been struggling with addiction. Some have told her research team that suspensions of evictions and extended unemployment benefits left them with more money than usual. And they said ""when I have money, I stock up on my (drug) supply,"" she said."
2987,Article 2987,"Overdose deaths are just one facet of what was overall the deadliest year in U.S. history. With about 378,000 deaths attributed to COVID-19, the nation saw more than 3.3 million deaths."
2989,Article 2989,"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reviewed death certificates to come up with the estimate for 2020 drug overdose deaths. The estimate of over 93,000 overdose deaths translates to an average of more than 250 deaths each day, or roughly 11 every hour."
2991,Article 2991,"The 21,000 increase is the biggest year-to-year jump since the count rose by 11,000 in 2016."
2993,Article 2993,"More historical context: According to the CDC, there were fewer than 7,200 total U.S. overdose deaths reported in 1970, when a heroin epidemic was raging in U.S. cities. There were about 9,000 in 1988, around the height of the crack epidemic."
2995,Article 2995,The CDC reported that in 2020 drug overdoses increased in all but two states: New Hampshire and South Dakota.
2997,Article 2997,"Kentucky's overdose count rose 54% last year to more than 2,100, up from fewer than 1,400 the year before. There were also large increases in South Carolina, West Virginia and California. Vermont had the largest jump, of about 58%, but smaller numbers — 118 to 186."
2999,Article 2999,"The proliferation of fentanyl is one reason some experts do not expect any substantial decline in drug overdose deaths this year. Though national figures are not yet available, there is data emerging from some states that seems to support their pessimism. Rhode Island, for example, reported 34 overdose deaths in January and 37 in February - the most for those months in at least five years."
