The reason we have 20% inflation under a Biden-Harris administration right now is because of all of the attacks on energy, for example, the bureaucracy we need permitting reform, we need deregulation. We need to unlock American businesses to meet the needs of Americans. Basically, when you have municipalities stopping new developments for lot sizes and for first time homebuyers. That's the things you need to do. By increasing and throwing more money and giving- like think about it for a second, this ticket, and I know Governor Walz, I'm friends with him in the National Governors Association. He's a nice guy. I've met, I've met Vice President Harris a couple times. She seems like a nice person, but if you think about the Democratic ticket, they've never worked in the private sector. They've- so their policies are showing that. You can't give every single first-time home buyer $25,000 and expect the prices of houses to come down. That's just not the way the economy works.

But on the economy, your state has a law that prohibits an increase of more than 10% for the price of goods and services during emergencies.

I think that, like all people, when you are experiencing something, you want to be able to tell your own story. And a lot of the people who are Palestinian, Palestinian-American, Arabs and Muslims, were asking for that opportunity. So while, you know, we all obviously believe that there should be a ceasefire immediately and permanently, and that Palestinians, just like Israelis, deserve the right to self-determination. We have to do more than just say that we believe that. We have to actually take steps that are going to evidence that take steps that are going to show that we're willing to start to listen to people who have been outside of the political, I would say, conversation for so long, it's been a third rail, and there's going to be a lot more work that we have to do to show to this demographic that the Democratic Party is- includes them in its big tent, includes them in our foreign policy considerations, and also includes them in our conversations around humanity and human rights."

And I think that this was a continuation of it. To put on stage, first of all, I think it's important that we recognize that even the way we talk about the movement is in a way that sometimes is a little wide, it's broad. It doesn't always take into account what folks are arguing about. I think that whether it's the Black lives movement or the movement for Palestinian rights, there's always this rush to say that their movement, the ways that they protest, the tactics, the strategies, are inconvenient, and I think that that's just the way that we've done it. Especially when we're nervous about a presidential election that we all know is incredibly important. Defeating Trump is the top concern, but we can do that, and we can also give space, create space for people, voices that are marginalized. We missed an opportunity to do that here, and in doing so, what we are essentially saying is that every Palestinian thinks the exact same way, that all folks who are protesting, who are voicing their concerns are one group and not individuals, not all folks who are coming with different perspectives. I think that there was room and space to say that. There was room in the Democratic Party for that particular perspective as well."

We know that in the past, there were systems in place that- that created an easier pathway for folks who attain citizenship, for folks to work, for folks to contribute, and that's what people want now.

The reason we have 20% inflation under a Biden-Harris administration right now is because of all of the attacks on energy, for example, the bureaucracy we need permitting reform, we need deregulation. We need to unlock American businesses to meet the needs of Americans. Basically, when you have municipalities stopping new developments for lot sizes and for first time homebuyers. That's the things you need to do. By increasing and throwing more money and giving- like think about it for a second, this ticket, and I know Governor Walz, I'm friends with him in the National Governors Association. He's a nice guy. I've met, I've met Vice President Harris a couple times. She seems like a nice person, but if you think about the Democratic ticket, they've never worked in the private sector. They've- so their policies are showing that. You can't give every single first-time home buyer $25,000 and expect the prices of houses to come down. That's just not the way the economy works.

I think that, like all people, when you are experiencing something, you want to be able to tell your own story. And a lot of the people who are Palestinian, Palestinian-American, Arabs and Muslims, were asking for that opportunity. So while, you know, we all obviously believe that there should be a ceasefire immediately and permanently, and that Palestinians, just like Israelis, deserve the right to self-determination. We have to do more than just say that we believe that. We have to actually take steps that are going to evidence that take steps that are going to show that we're willing to start to listen to people who have been outside of the political, I would say, conversation for so long, it's been a third rail, and there's going to be a lot more work that we have to do to show to this demographic that the Democratic Party is- includes them in its big tent, includes them in our foreign policy considerations, and also includes them in our conversations around humanity and human rights."

LEE: I think that there has been, and I think that if you really look at this, long before October 7, it was almost taboo to talk about Palestinians, to talk about the experiences that they have and that they continue to have in our politics. And I think that this was a continuation of it. To put on stage, first of all, I think it's important that we recognize that even the way we talk about the movement is in a way that sometimes is a little wide, it's broad. It doesn't always take into account what folks are arguing about. I think that whether it's the Black lives movement or the movement for Palestinian rights, there's always this rush to say that their movement, the ways that they protest, the tactics, the strategies, are inconvenient, and I think that that's just the way that we've done it. Especially when we're nervous about a presidential election that we all know is incredibly important. Defeating Trump is the top concern, but we can do that, and we can also give space, create space for people, voices that are marginalized. We missed an opportunity to do that here, and in doing so, what we are essentially saying is that every Palestinian thinks the exact same way, that all folks who are protesting, who are voicing their concerns are one group and not individuals, not all folks who are coming with different perspectives. I think that there was room and space to say that. There was room in the Democratic Party for that particular perspective as well."

We're asking them- for them to run to them. You know, there's this idea that to say that, you know, having health care or equitable education, or even talking about, you know, immigration reform and the border in a humane way is somehow to the left, but I think that that's what the average American wants. And I think that in too many, in very many ways, we've ceded ground to Republicans, especially around immigration. They have the tendency of talking about it in an incredibly fear mongering and inhumane way. And I don't think that it's wise that we join them in that.

The reason we have 20% inflation under a Biden-Harris administration right now is because of all of the attacks on energy, for example, the bureaucracy we need permitting reform, we need deregulation. We need to unlock American businesses to meet the needs of Americans. Basically, when you have municipalities stopping new developments for lot sizes and for first time homebuyers. That's the things you need to do. By increasing and throwing more money and giving- like think about it for a second, this ticket, and I know Governor Walz, I'm friends with him in the National Governors Association. He's a nice guy. I've met, I've met Vice President Harris a couple times. She seems like a nice person, but if you think about the Democratic ticket, they've never worked in the private sector. They've- so their policies are showing that. You can't give every single first-time home buyer $25,000 and expect the prices of houses to come down. That's just not the way the economy works.

But on the economy, your state has a law that prohibits an increase of more than 10% for the price of goods and services during emergencies.

I think that, like all people, when you are experiencing something, you want to be able to tell your own story. And a lot of the people who are Palestinian, Palestinian-American, Arabs and Muslims, were asking for that opportunity. So while, you know, we all obviously believe that there should be a ceasefire immediately and permanently, and that Palestinians, just like Israelis, deserve the right to self-determination. We have to do more than just say that we believe that. We have to actually take steps that are going to evidence that take steps that are going to show that we're willing to start to listen to people who have been outside of the political, I would say, conversation for so long, it's been a third rail, and there's going to be a lot more work that we have to do to show to this demographic that the Democratic Party is- includes them in its big tent, includes them in our foreign policy considerations, and also includes them in our conversations around humanity and human rights."

And I think that this was a continuation of it. To put on stage, first of all, I think it's important that we recognize that even the way we talk about the movement is in a way that sometimes is a little wide, it's broad. It doesn't always take into account what folks are arguing about. I think that whether it's the Black lives movement or the movement for Palestinian rights, there's always this rush to say that their movement, the ways that they protest, the tactics, the strategies, are inconvenient, and I think that that's just the way that we've done it. Especially when we're nervous about a presidential election that we all know is incredibly important. Defeating Trump is the top concern, but we can do that, and we can also give space, create space for people, voices that are marginalized. We missed an opportunity to do that here, and in doing so, what we are essentially saying is that every Palestinian thinks the exact same way, that all folks who are protesting, who are voicing their concerns are one group and not individuals, not all folks who are coming with different perspectives. I think that there was room and space to say that. There was room in the Democratic Party for that particular perspective as well."

The reason we have 20% inflation under a Biden-Harris administration right now is because of all of the attacks on energy, for example, the bureaucracy we need permitting reform, we need deregulation. We need to unlock American businesses to meet the needs of Americans. Basically, when you have municipalities stopping new developments for lot sizes and for first time homebuyers. That's the things you need to do. By increasing and throwing more money and giving- like think about it for a second, this ticket, and I know Governor Walz, I'm friends with him in the National Governors Association. He's a nice guy. I've met, I've met Vice President Harris a couple times. She seems like a nice person, but if you think about the Democratic ticket, they've never worked in the private sector. They've- so their policies are showing that. You can't give every single first-time home buyer $25,000 and expect the prices of houses to come down. That's just not the way the economy works.

I think that, like all people, when you are experiencing something, you want to be able to tell your own story. And a lot of the people who are Palestinian, Palestinian-American, Arabs and Muslims, were asking for that opportunity. So while, you know, we all obviously believe that there should be a ceasefire immediately and permanently, and that Palestinians, just like Israelis, deserve the right to self-determination. We have to do more than just say that we believe that. We have to actually take steps that are going to evidence that take steps that are going to show that we're willing to start to listen to people who have been outside of the political, I would say, conversation for so long, it's been a third rail, and there's going to be a lot more work that we have to do to show to this demographic that the Democratic Party is- includes them in its big tent, includes them in our foreign policy considerations, and also includes them in our conversations around humanity and human rights."

LEE: I think that there has been, and I think that if you really look at this, long before October 7, it was almost taboo to talk about Palestinians, to talk about the experiences that they have and that they continue to have in our politics. And I think that this was a continuation of it. To put on stage, first of all, I think it's important that we recognize that even the way we talk about the movement is in a way that sometimes is a little wide, it's broad. It doesn't always take into account what folks are arguing about. I think that whether it's the Black lives movement or the movement for Palestinian rights, there's always this rush to say that their movement, the ways that they protest, the tactics, the strategies, are inconvenient, and I think that that's just the way that we've done it. Especially when we're nervous about a presidential election that we all know is incredibly important. Defeating Trump is the top concern, but we can do that, and we can also give space, create space for people, voices that are marginalized. We missed an opportunity to do that here, and in doing so, what we are essentially saying is that every Palestinian thinks the exact same way, that all folks who are protesting, who are voicing their concerns are one group and not individuals, not all folks who are coming with different perspectives. I think that there was room and space to say that. There was room in the Democratic Party for that particular perspective as well."
