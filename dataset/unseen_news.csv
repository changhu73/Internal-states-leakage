319,Article 319,"In what Israel is calling a preemptive strike against Hezbollah targets inside Lebanon and with what Iran-backed Hezbollah militants say is a retaliatory response, this morning, there remains hope of avoiding a wider conflict in the Mideast. We will have a report from Tel Aviv. And Trump administration National Security Adviser Lieutenant General H.R. McMaster will also be here."
320,Article 320,"Plus: How will the Harris/Walz campaign keep their momentum going following their glitzy Chicago convention? The record $540 million raised in the last month will certainly help. But how will they tackle tough challenges on the economy, the Mideast and immigration policy?"

334,Article 334,"Overnight, there has been a military escalation in the Mideast with what could be the long-anticipated opening salvo in an expanded regional conflict. The U.S. did not participate in the Israeli strike against Hezbollah, but President Biden's top military adviser, General C.Q. Brown, is expected in Israel today."
335,Article 335,"This escalation has not disrupted the diplomacy under way in Cairo, where CIA Director Bill Burns continues to broker a cease-fire in Gaza, as well as a hostage and prisoner exchange between Israel and Hamas."
336,Article 336,"Here in the U.S., these developments are being very closely watched from the campaign trail as the countdown to Election Day continues."
337,Article 337,We begin with CBS News' foreign correspondent Imtiaz Tyab in Tel Aviv.
338,Article 338,(Begin VT)
339,Article 339,IMTIAZ TYAB (voice-over): Israeli missile defenses intercept rockets in the skies above Northern Israel. The Iran-backed Hezbollah movement in Lebanon says it fired over 300 missiles and drones into Israeli territory.
340,Article 340,"But Israel's military said the attack could have been much larger had it not carried out a massive overnight preemptive strike inside Southern Lebanon, apparently involving around 100 fighter jets. Hezbollah has said its strikes were in retaliation for the assassination of Fuad Shukr, one of the group's most senior commanders, in Beirut last month."
341,Article 341,We were at his memorial service shortly after he was killed.
342,Article 342,The calls to avenge Fuad Shukr's death in that Israeli assassination are only growing. People here want revenge.
343,Article 343,A revenge attack that took Hezbollah nearly a month to carry out.

347,Article 347,(End VT)
348,Article 348,IMTIAZ TYAB: And at least three fighters were killed in the Israeli strikes on Lebanon.
349,Article 349,"And Hezbollah says it killed one soldier in Israel. And while it's hoped the threat of an all-out regional war stays contained, Margaret, Hezbollah is already warning this morning's attack was only the first phase."
350,Article 350,MARGARET BRENNAN: Imtiaz Tyab in Tel Aviv.
351,Article 351,"And we're joined by the Israeli ambassador to the United States, Michael Herzog."
352,Article 352,"Ambassador, good to have you here."
353,Article 353,"MICHAEL HERZOG (Israeli Ambassador to the United States): Good morning, Margaret."
354,Article 354,"MARGARET BRENNAN: So, we just heard about the casualties."
355,Article 355,"Tell me, was this friendly fire? Did Hezbollah, as they claim, actually cause some Israeli casualties?"
356,Article 356,"AMBASSADOR MICHAEL HERZOG: So, what happened yesterday is that we identify concrete planning and preparation by Hezbollah to launch a massive missile and drone attack into Israel, and we carried the real-time operation in order to degrade those capabilities that were about to be launched at Israel."
357,Article 357,"We were successful. Nevertheless, they launched several hundred rockets into Israel and also drones that were aimed at Central Israel, and we intercepted all of them. One of our soldiers was killed by the debris of Israeli interceptors."
358,Article 358,MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you assess at this point that we are escalating towards a regional war or that we are taking a step back? Is there risk of escalation?
359,Article 359,AMBASSADOR MICHAEL HERZOG: I believe that the success of our operation yesterday prevented an escalation to a major war.
360,Article 360,The threat is still there. We still need a settlement with Hezbollah in Southern Lebanon. They followed Hamas by launching the war with Israel on October 8. And they have been firing thousands of rockets into Israel since then.
361,Article 361,"We give a chance to diplomacy, and we hope it works. But, if not, we have nearly 70,000 people in Israel, Northern Israel, away from their homes, refugees in their own country, and we have to make sure they can go back safely to their homes."
362,Article 362,"MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm, and – and many in Southern Lebanon also unable to return to their homes."
363,Article 363,It's being reported that Israel and Hezbollah have been trading messages back and forth not to escalate. I know that the Qatari prime minister is headed to Iran tomorrow with a message not to escalate. Do you believe that you can avoid a direct attack by Iran on Israel?
364,Article 364,AMBASSADOR MICHAEL HERZOG: I believe so.
365,Article 365,"I think the Iranians are contemplating an attack on Israel, but decided for now to put it on hold. And I think the main reason for that was deterrent messages from Israel and the U.S. and a very strong U.S. posture in the region, which tells you that you can deter them."
366,Article 366,"MARGARET BRENNAN: There are 40,000 U.S. troops now in the region. What is it that you think General C.Q. Brown will do when he arrives in Israel later today? Is this further planning for potential attacks?"
367,Article 367,"AMBASSADOR MICHAEL HERZOG: Well, as I said, we do not seek war, and we don't believe that they seek war."
368,Article 368,"However, there is room for miscalculation. And I think part of his regional visit is to make sure that everything is under control. Again, the U.S. posture in the region is very strong and I think played a role in deterring Iran."
369,Article 369,"MARGARET BRENNAN: In Cairo, you mentioned the diplomacy that is under way. The CIA director, Bill Burns, is there, Brett McGurk, one of the president's top advisers, as well."
370,Article 370,"Hamas has sent a political delegation to Cairo. Now, we know it is Yahya Sinwar who is the ultimate decider here, but do you see that there is momentum in these talks? Is a breakthrough that brings home the hostages possible?"
371,Article 371,"AMBASSADOR MICHAEL HERZOG: We certainly hope so. As we speak, we have an Israeli delegation in Cairo, along with all the mediators and a Hamas representative, and we hope to make progress."
372,Article 372,"As Secretary Blinken said a few days ago, the U.S. put forward a bridging proposal, which was accepted by Israel, and now it's up to Hamas to say if they accept it or not. So they did send their representative. But we're still not 100 percent sure that they are in the game. We certainly hope so. And, if that is the case, we can make progress towards a deal."
373,Article 373,"MARGARET BRENNAN: The secretary of state did say the bridging proposal was accepted. But then your prime minister has said things publicly that seem to contradict that in terms of the specifics, particularly among that Philadelphi Corridor."
374,Article 374,What is reality?
375,Article 375,AMBASSADOR MICHAEL HERZOG: The reality is that we are not obliged to leave the Philadelphi Corridor at this phase. We are reducing our forces there.
376,Article 376,We had constructive talks in Egypt a few days ago. We are well-coordinated with the U.S. administration. We're waiting for Hamas to see if they are in the game.
377,Article 377,"MARGARET BRENNAN: When you say in this phase, are you being specific in saying that's not part of phase one of this multiphase diplomatic deal the U.S. is trying to broker?"
378,Article 378,"AMBASSADOR MICHAEL HERZOG: The deal is multiphase, as you said, but we are now focusing on phase one."
379,Article 379,"And phase one, we hope to get as many live hostages out as possible. It comes with a pause in our military operation for at least 42 days. And, in that period, we hope that, again, we can release as – get out as many live hostages as possible. Every day that passes endangers their lives."
380,Article 380,"MARGARET BRENNAN: Ambassador Herzog, thank you."
381,Article 381,AMBASSADOR MICHAEL HERZOG: Thank you.
382,Article 382,"MARGARET BRENNAN: I know it's been a long night, so I appreciate you being live with us this morning."
383,Article 383,AMBASSADOR MICHAEL HERZOG: Thank you.
384,Article 384,"MARGARET BRENNAN: And we are joined now by CBS News foreign policy and national security contributor retired Lieutenant General H.R. McMaster. He has a new book out, ""At War With Ourselves: My Tour of Duty in the Trump White House,"" about his service there as national security adviser."
385,Article 385,Welcome back to the program.
386,Article 386,"Just on the news of the moment, CENTCOM has about 40,000 U.S. troops in the region, this real muscular show of force. How concerned are you about miscalculation and blowback to those U.S. forces?"
387,Article 387,LT. GEN. H.R. MCMASTER (RET.): Yes.
388,Article 388,"Well, what I'm concerned about, Margaret, is that those forces will be constrained in what they're able to do in response. I think what we have seen is a reluctance to act like we know what the return address is for this violence."
389,Article 389,"And, of course, the return address is Iran. And I think all Americans…"
390,Article 390,MARGARET BRENNAN: What does that mean exactly? What do you want to do..
391,Article 391,(CROSSTALK)
392,Article 392,"LT. GEN. H.R. MCMASTER (RET.): Well, what it means is, Iran is pursuing a strategy that – in which it is willing to expend every Arab life, every Palestinian life, every Lebanese life, in pursuit of its objective of destroying Israel."
393,Article 393,"Meanwhile, Iran is continuing to funnel weapons not only into Southern Lebanon, but to essentially a proxy army in Syria, into the West Bank. And this is why the Philadelphi Corridor is so important to Israel…"
394,Article 394,MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.
395,Article 395,LT. GEN. H.R. MCMASTER (RET.): … is to keep Hamas isolated from a resupply from the Iranians as well.
396,Article 396,"At the same time, Iran is racing to produce a nuclear device. So I think what we have to recognize is this horrible situation in the region that's been going on for 40 years, right?"
397,Article 397,MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.
398,Article 398,"LT. GEN. H.R. MCMASTER (RET.): It's important to remember that Shukr, the Hezbollah commander…"
399,Article 399,MARGARET BRENNAN: Hezbollah.
400,Article 400,LT. GEN. H.R. MCMASTER (RET.): … who was killed and who the – the – Hezbollah is now trying to launch these attacks in retribution for that.
401,Article 401,"I mean, he was responsible in part…"
402,Article 402,MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.
403,Article 403,"LT. GEN. H.R. MCMASTER (RET.): … for the 1983 bombings that killed 241 Marines, so – in 1983."
404,Article 404,MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.
405,Article 405,"LT. GEN. H.R. MCMASTER (RET.): So, this has been going on for decades. And I think that the narrative that you constantly hear about turning down the temperature, escalation management…"
406,Article 406,MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.
407,Article 407,"LT. GEN. H.R. MCMASTER (RET.): … the reluctance really to confront Iran directly and impose costs on Iran, that actually gives Iran license to escalate on their own terms with impunity."
408,Article 408,"MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, this is just one of many extremely serious situations that the next commander in chief will be walking into."
409,Article 409,It doesn't go away in January.
410,Article 410,LT. GEN. H.R. MCMASTER (RET.): Right.
411,Article 411,MARGARET BRENNAN: And that's why I want to get to some of what you wrote about in your book. You had this front-row seat. You advised Donald Trump on very sensitive national security matters.
412,Article 412,"You write he found it difficult to distinguish – quote – ""between those who brought him sound analysis and those real or imagined who brought him hackneyed bromides. He'd say outlandish things, like go bomb the drugs in Mexico, or why don't we take out the whole North Korean army during one of their parades?"""
413,Article 413,"If Trump wins reelection, will he be able to recruit high-quality advisers who can actually help him make sound decisions?"
414,Article 414,"LT. GEN. H.R. MCMASTER (RET.): Margaret, I think so, especially in confirmed positions, and if it's a Trump administration."
415,Article 415,MARGARET BRENNAN: Because Congress would stop him from putting someone who isn't quality? Is that what you're saying?
416,Article 416,"LT. GEN. H.R. MCMASTER (RET.): Well, I think so. You know, I think so, and there are people who are willing to serve who can help do what we tried to do in that first year."
417,Article 417,"And the narrative around that first year was all about chaos. But we got a lot done. And, in fact, the story is largely about overcoming that kind of infighting, that war with ourselves…"
418,Article 418,MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.
419,Article 419,LT. GEN. H.R. MCMASTER (RET.): … to produce policy outcomes that advanced America's interests.
420,Article 420,"One of those was a dramatic reversal of the Obama administration Iran policy, which, sadly, the Biden administration has put back into place."
421,Article 421,"MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Iran continued with its nuclear development after Trump exited the nuclear deal, against the advice of his secretary of state and his defense secretary."
422,Article 422,So…
423,Article 423,"LT. GEN. H.R. MCMASTER (RET.): I'm talking more about like the sanctions relief, Margaret…"
424,Article 424,MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.
425,Article 425,"LT. GEN. H.R. MCMASTER (RET.): … and the degree to which not enforcing the Trump era sanctions had really resulted in about $100 billion transferred to the Iranians, which they have used to intensify their proxy wars in the region, from Iraq to Yemen to Syria to Lebanon and obviously to Gaza with the October 7 attacks."
426,Article 426,"MARGARET BRENNAN: You detail specific examples of China's Xi Jinping, Vladimir Putin, even Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu manipulating Donald Trump."
427,Article 427,LT. GEN. H.R. MCMASTER (RET.): Right.
428,Article 428,MARGARET BRENNAN: And you saw it as it happened.
429,Article 429,"You wrote that: ""Trump's lack of historical knowledge made him susceptible to Xi Jinping's efforts to generate sympathy.'"
430,Article 430,"So what is the scenario you fear, that, in a second term, Donald Trump pulls U.S. troops out of Asia or that he brokers a transaction to give up Taiwan?"
431,Article 431,LT. GEN. H.R. MCMASTER (RET.): Right.
432,Article 432,"Well, I write in the book, Margaret, about this dissonance that Donald Trump carries with him, these opposing ideas that sometimes he finds it difficult to reconcile. And that's why I think it's important that he has a competent team around him to help him identify his own agenda."
433,Article 433,"I mean, the story in ""At War With Ourselves"" is in large measure my effort to guard his independence of judgment, because, in any administration, there are people who try to manipulate a president into decisions. They don't want to give a president options."
434,Article 434,"What my experience was during that first year and a period in which we put into place a lot of these big shifts in policy is, if you give him best analysis, if you give him multiple options, it's in the comparison of those options that he can consider the long-term costs and consequences and make sound decisions."
435,Article 435,"Also in the book, though, Margaret, I write about at times he finds it tough to stick with those decisions…"
436,Article 436,MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.
437,Article 437,"LT. GEN. H.R. MCMASTER (RET.): … because people know kind of how to push his buttons, especially buttons associated with maintaining the complete support of his political base."
438,Article 438,MARGARET BRENNAN: Manipulate him.
439,Article 439,"You also wrote a specific example where Trump wrote a flattering note to Vladimir Putin in 2018, and it happened to be the same time that this poisoning…"
440,Article 440,LT. GEN. H.R. MCMASTER (RET.): Yes.
441,Article 441,MARGARET BRENNAN: … had happened on the soil of a U.S. ally by Russia.
442,Article 442,LT. GEN. H.R. MCMASTER (RET.): Right.
443,Article 443,"MARGARET BRENNAN: When you got home, you said to your wife: ""After a year in this job, I cannot understand Putin's hold on Trump."""
444,Article 444,LT. GEN. H.R. MCMASTER (RET.): Yes.
445,Article 445,MARGARET BRENNAN: How do you explain that now?
446,Article 446,"LT. GEN. H.R. MCMASTER (RET.): Well, I explained it in the book."
447,Article 447,"I try to place the president's belief that he could have a good deal with Vladimir Putin in context of the two previous presidents who thought that they could have a good deal with Putin. But, also, President Trump – and people know this – he likes big, splashy deals."
448,Article 448,He liked – he was pursuing that with Putin. He was pursuing that with Xi Jinping.
449,Article 449,MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.
450,Article 450,"LT. GEN. H.R. MCMASTER (RET.): And, of course, Putin is the best liar in the world."
451,Article 451,"And so I struggled, Margaret, should I write about how Putin tried to manipulate President Trump or not? And I thought, well, Putin knows how he was trying to do it, so maybe, in writing about how Putin was trying to press Donald Trump's buttons, that will make a future President Trump, if he's elected, less susceptible to those kind of tactics."
452,Article 452,"MARGARET BRENNAN: Because he, on the campaign trail, argues these counterfactuals, that Putin was afraid of him, that Putin wouldn't have invaded Ukraine if he had been president."
453,Article 453,"LT. GEN. H.R. MCMASTER (RET.): Well, he has a point in a couple of areas."
454,Article 454,"In that first year of the Trump administration, I tell the story of how we imposed more sanctions on Russian entities in that one year than the previous eight years of the Obama administration."
455,Article 455,MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.
456,Article 456,"LT. GEN. H.R. MCMASTER (RET.): And the really critical decision, though, Margaret, I think, was to provide the Ukrainians with defensive capabilities, especially in the form of Javelin missiles."
457,Article 457,MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.
458,Article 458,"LT. GEN. H.R. MCMASTER (RET.): But in the area of inconsistency, I also tell the story about how that support was suspended to get evidence of the Biden family's corrupt activities in Ukraine."
459,Article 459,MARGARET BRENNAN: The grounds for impeachment…
460,Article 460,"LT. GEN. H.R. MCMASTER (RET.): Right, absolutely."
461,Article 461,MARGARET BRENNAN: … which basically you're saying were justified.
462,Article 462,LT. GEN. H.R. MCMASTER (RET.): Right. So there is…
463,Article 463,MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.
464,Article 464,LT. GEN. H.R. MCMASTER (RET.): There's an element in the story about how he can make really sound decisions and disrupt things that need to be disrupted in terms of foreign policy and national security…
465,Article 465,MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.
466,Article 466,LT. GEN. H.R. MCMASTER (RET.): … but oftentimes struggles to hang on to those decisions and see them through.
467,Article 467,"MARGARET BRENNAN: H.R. McMaster, thank you. It's an interesting read."
468,Article 468,"LT. GEN. H.R. MCMASTER (RET.): Thanks, Margaret. Thank you, Margaret."
469,Article 469,MARGARET BRENNAN: We will be right back.
470,Article 470,(ANNOUNCEMENTS)
471,Article 471,MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to Pennsylvania Democratic Congresswoman Summer Lee. She joins us from Pittsburgh.
472,Article 472,"Good morning to you, Congresswoman."
473,Article 473,REPRESENTATIVE SUMMER LEE (D-Pennsylvania): Good morning.
474,Article 474,"MARGARET BRENNAN: Our CBS polling shows that a majority of Americans, 59 percent of them, think the U.S. should encourage Israel to stop or decrease its military actions in Gaza."
475,Article 475,At the Democratic Convention. Vice President Harris received loud applause for these remarks:
476,Article 476,(Begin VT)
477,Article 477,"KAMALA HARRIS (Vice President of the United States (D) and U.S. Presidential Candidate): President Biden and I are working to end this war such that Israel is secure, the hostages are released, the suffering in Gaza ends, and the Palestinian people can realize their right to dignity, security, freedom and self-determination."
478,Article 478,(CHEERING)
479,Article 479,(APPLAUSE)
480,Article 480,(End VT)
481,Article 481,MARGARET BRENNAN: Now that is largely just restating existing U.S. policy.
482,Article 482,Do you think that's sufficient outreach to those who felt the administration hasn't expressed empathy?
483,Article 483,"REPRESENTATIVE SUMMER LEE: You know, I think that – you know, I think people who are experiencing this, right, who are – who are outside of the arena, who have been organizing since October, you know, that is a step."
484,Article 484,"But I think that what they really were asking for was a – of course, the opportunity to speak for themselves. I think that, like all people, when you are experiencing something, you want to be able to tell your own story. And a lot of the people who are Palestinian, Palestinian-American, Arabs and Muslims were asking for that opportunity."
485,Article 485,"So while, you know, we all obviously believe that there should be a cease- fire immediately and permanently, and that Palestinians, just like Israelis, deserve the right to self-determination, we have to do more than just say that we believe that. We have to actually take steps that are going to evidence that, take steps that are going to show that we're willing to start to listen to people who have been outside of the political, I would say, conversation for so long."
486,Article 486,"It's been a third rail. And there's going to be a lot more work that we have to do to show to this demographic that the Democratic Party is – includes them in its big tent, includes them in our foreign policy considerations, and also includes them in our conversations around humanity and human rights."
487,Article 487,MARGARET BRENNAN: You're talking about the decision at the DNC to deny anyone from the Uncommitted Movement or Palestinian-American to take the stage.
488,Article 488,"Congressman Ro Khanna tweeted: ""It was a tragic mistake, perpetuating the erasure of the Palestinian story and voice."""
489,Article 489,"Why do you think Democratic leaders resisted it, and is it a self-inflicted wound?"
490,Article 490,"REPRESENTATIVE SUMMER LEE: I think that there has been – and I think that, if you really look at this, long before October 7, it was almost taboo to talk about Palestinians, to talk about the experiences that they have and that they continue to have in our politics."
491,Article 491,"And I think that this was a continuation of it. To put on stage – first of all, I think it's important that we recognize that even the way we talk about the movement is in a way that sometimes is a little wide – it's broad."
492,Article 492,MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.
493,Article 493,REPRESENTATIVE SUMMER LEE: It doesn't always take into account what folks are arguing about.
494,Article 494,"I think that, whether it's the Black lives movement or the movement for Palestinian rights, there's always this rush to say that their movement, the ways that they protest, the tactics, the strategies are inconvenient. And I think that that's just the way that we've done it, especially when we're nervous about a presidential election that we all know is incredibly important."
495,Article 495,"Defeating Trump is the top concern, but we can do that, and we can also give space, create space for people, voices that are marginalized. We missed an opportunity to do that here. And in doing so, what we are essentially saying is that every Palestinian thinks the exact same way, that all folks who are protesting who are voicing their concerns are one group, and not individuals, not all folks who are coming with different perspectives."
496,Article 496,I think that there was room and space to say that…
497,Article 497,MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.
498,Article 498,REPRESENTATIVE SUMMER LEE: … there is room in the Democratic Party for that particular perspective as well.
499,Article 499,"MARGARET BRENNAN: This was a historic nomination of Vice President Harris as the first black, first South Asian nominee of a major party."
500,Article 500,She's chosen really not to talk about the historic nature of that. Do you think that she should?
501,Article 501,REPRESENTATIVE SUMMER LEE: I think that it speaks for itself.
502,Article 502,"You know, I think that there is, you know, zero chance that folks all across America do not recognize that she would be the first Black woman, the first South Asian woman in person, to be not just our party's nominee, but hopefully our president."
503,Article 503,"So, to talk about it, it's almost a filler. I think that what's – I think that what they're doing and what they should be doing is talking about the issues…"
504,Article 504,MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.
505,Article 505,REPRESENTATIVE SUMMER LEE: … talking about the things that not…
506,Article 506,MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.
507,Article 507,"REPRESENTATIVE SUMMER LEE: … are not just unique to women, black women, Asian women…"
508,Article 508,MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.
509,Article 509,REPRESENTATIVE SUMMER LEE: … but actually the things that make her qualified for the job…
510,Article 510,MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.
511,Article 511,"REPRESENTATIVE SUMMER LEE: … her – her resume, the policies that that bring Democrats to – to vote…"
512,Article 512,"MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes, let's – let's talk about those things…"
513,Article 513,"REPRESENTATIVE SUMMER LEE: … you know, on November 5. Those are things that we're going to need to focus on. We all know there's history here."
514,Article 514,"MARGARET BRENNAN: Congresswoman, let's talk about those things on the other side of this next break."
515,Article 515,Stay with us.
516,Article 516,(ANNOUNCEMENTS)
517,Article 517,"MARGARET BRENNAN: Just ahead, we talk to former FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb, as well as New York Congressman Pat Ryan, and Oklahoma Republican Governor Kevin Stitt."
518,Article 518,"So, stay with us."
519,Article 519,(ANNOUNCEMENTS)
520,Article 520,MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION.
521,Article 521,We're continuing our conversation now with Congresswoman Summer Lee of Pennsylvania.
522,Article 522,"Congresswoman, you were talking before the break about the need to focus on issues for - for the campaign. This past week former Speaker Pelosi stated Vice President Harris will, quote, ""have to govern from the center because that's where the public is."""
523,Article 523,"I know you are a progressive Democrat. Do you think that this pivot to the center, particularly on issues like the border and immigration and crime, are they going to hurt support for the Harris-Walz ticket or is it - what's required?"
524,Article 524,"REPRESENTATIVE SUMMER LEE (D-PA): Yes. So, I have to say, and I - and I like to hope that we're able to do this. I have to - I have to disagree a bit. I think that we have data, we have polling, we have anecdotal evidence from American – Americans all over the country, but especially out in Pennsylvania, in a swing state, where we're not actually asking for our - our candidates to run away from progressive ideals. We're asking them for - for them to run to them."
525,Article 525,"You know, there's this idea that to say that, you know, having health care or an equitable education or even talking about, you know, immigration reform and the border in a humane way is somehow to the left. But I think that that's what the average American wants. And I think that in too many - in very many ways we've ceded ground to Republicans, especially around immigration. They have the tendency of talking about it in incredibly fear mongering and inhumane way. And I don't think that it's wise that we join them in that. I think people want to see us distinguish ourselves as a party. I think they want to see that we offer solutions for working class people, for marginalized people. And I think that we can do that vocally and proudly and still bring people to the party and not have them run away from it."
526,Article 526,"MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. So, that means you disagree with the Harris endorsement of the bipartisan border bill, which was a fairly conservative bill, and that's the policy stated for what the vice president would enact if she's elected?"
527,Article 527,"REPRESENTATIVE SUMMER LEE: I think that what I'd like to hope - I hope that - what I think so many of us want to see, and not just progressives, I mean even just Democrats, is that we can recognize that we need comprehensive immigration reform. That there are millions of folks in America who are impacted by this. Folks who want to come here for a better life. Who are looking for opportunities. And they are finding that the pathway, the window to achieving those opportunities is shutting, not opening."
528,Article 528,"We know that in the past there were systems in place that - that created a - an easier pathway for folks to obtain citizenship, for folks to work, for folks to contribute. And that's what people want now. And I think that we need to be real about the solutions, what's driving folks to our border."
529,Article 529,MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.
530,Article 530,REPRESENTATIVE SUMMER LEE: And what's driving folks to want to make a life here in the United States at the same time.
531,Article 531,"MARGARET BRENNAN: All right, Congresswoman Lee, thank you for your perspective."
532,Article 532,"For a slightly different one from a fellow Democrat, we are joined now by New York Congressman Pat Ryan."
533,Article 533,Good morning.
534,Article 534,"REPRESENTATIVE PAT RYAN (D-NY): Hey, how are you doing, Margaret?"
535,Article 535,MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm doing well.
536,Article 536,"You know, you were at the DNC this week speaking on stage. You were one of the very first House Democrats to call out and publicly say Joe Biden needed to pass the torch."
537,Article 537,"You're in a tight re-election race in - in Hudson Valley, New York. Do you think that having Kamala Harris at the top of the ticket makes it easier for you to win than if Joe Biden had stayed?"
538,Article 538,"REPRESENTATIVE PAT RYAN: Without question. I mean, coming out of the DNC, and - and for the last now month plus we have just seen such energy, such enthusiasm, such true joy and optimism at a time when even, this morning in your coverage, it's a challenging, dark and divided time. And that's what people in my district are - are desperate for. That - that is what we've been working on."
539,Article 539,"When Kamala Harris talks about freedom, patriotism, reproductive freedom, economic freedom, freedom to breathe clean air and water, that is what folks, regardless of party, they want to believe in something, to be for something. And she has delivered that. And I think over the next 72 days we're going to see that momentum continue to build."
540,Article 540,MARGARET BRENNAN: The former speaker points to five seats in New York state as determining the difference between Democrats having a minority or majority spot in Congress. You are one of those seats. Do you think that now Democrats have a better shot at gaining the majority?
541,Article 541,"REPRESENTATIVE PAT RYAN: Yes, no doubt."
542,Article 542,MARGARET BRENNAN: Definitely?
543,Article 543,"REPRESENTATIVE PAT RYAN: No doubt. It's just been a sea change. I mean, I won my last race by 1.3 percent."
544,Article 544,MARGARET BRENNAN: Exactly.
545,Article 545,"REPRESENTATIVE PAT RYAN: Very attune to what's happening in my district and talking to folks all day, every day. It has been just kind of putting rocket fuel into a jet engine and seeing blast off. It's such - it's so important, I think, to understand, it's one thing to be against a set of things -"
546,Article 546,MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.
547,Article 547,"REPRESENTATIVE PAT RYAN: But - but to be for a set of things and a set - and for core freedoms, that is - that's rallying people."
548,Article 548,"MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, so then let's put this in specific terms because some of the policies aren't that different from Joe Biden's policies. In fact, they're exactly the same on - on the border. And you, when you issued that statement calling for Biden to step aside, you called for him to restore order at the border. Your district has been hit with a lot of migrants being sent from New York City up to the Hudson Valley. What is any different about the Harris platform on the border?"
549,Article 549,"REPRESENTATIVE PAT RYAN: I served 27 months in combat. I know what it means to secure a border. And I think foundational to the responsibilities of a nation state is to secure the border. That - that's not a partisan thing, that's a widely held view. So, I - I did, you know, call on and sort of call out President Biden in not doing enough. They've - they've - they've -"
550,Article 550,MARGARET BRENNAN: But that was the Biden-Harris policy.
551,Article 551,"REPRESENTATIVE PAT RYAN: They've stepped up. And wat we heard from Vice President Harris at the convention, in her speech, was exactly what folks in my district want to hear, which is, we're going to secure the border, restore order at the border, but not lose who we are as Americans to welcome folks that want to come here, make a better life, serve our country, make it better and stronger. We can do both. We will do both."
552,Article 552,"MARGARET BRENNAN: So, but it's still not articulated as a different policy in the specifics. We haven't heard the vice president at least say things in detail."
553,Article 553,"But on the issue of abortion, which is already protected in New York state up to 24 weeks, after that point it has to be that the mother's life is at risk for that procedure to be taken, but it's going to be on the ballot in some form or fashion in November. Do you think that this is just about driving up turnout?"
554,Article 554,REPRESENTATIVE PAT RYAN: The whole founding -
555,Article 555,MARGARET BRENNAN: It's already protected (INAUDIBLE).
556,Article 556,REPRESENTATIVE PAT RYAN: The whole founding ideology of our country is about freedom. People don't forget that just two years ago the - Trump's appointees to the Supreme Court ripped away a fundamental freedom. There have been more states across the country now taking away American freedoms.
557,Article 557,"You want to piss off the American people, take their freedom away."
558,Article 558,And so this is - this is not like a political thing again. This gets to the core of who we are.
559,Article 559,"And so in New York, things like the Comstock Act that are on the books, outlined in Project 2025, even without congressional action, the Trump - hypothetical Trump administration says they can put in place essentially a backdoor national abortion ban. We are stand ug up against that, as Democrats, really as Americans though. And that will be a huge issue in my district."
560,Article 560,MARGARET BRENNAN: Trump and Vance haven't been very clear on the Comstock Act. I asked vice - I asked J.D. Vance a lot of questions about it just a few weeks ago.
561,Article 561,"Just to put that aside, though, I want to ask you about Afghanistan, because in your - in your call for Joe Biden to step aside, you also pointed to that as a Biden-Harris problem. In fact, you said it was a strategic and a moral failure, that withdraw. The vice president says she was that last person in the room on that decision. Is that failure also hers?"
562,Article 562,REPRESENTATIVE PAT RYAN: We've got to stop assigning partisan blame on fundamental things like our national security.
563,Article 563,MARGARET BRENNAN: You said that.
564,Article 564,"REPRESENTATIVE PAT RYAN: I - I said it as an American. I said it as someone who served in combat, who had friends that served in Afghanistan. If we can't make mistakes and - and wrestle with that, with a little bit of space to do better in the future, how do we expect to continue on the next 250 years as this great country that we are?"
565,Article 565,"So, we have to be - and I've called on presidents of both parties when I disagree with them, on behalf of my constituents, on behalf of what I think is right for the country. So, we have to be able to do that."
566,Article 566,MARGARET BRENNAN: I bring that up because we are coming up on the three- year anniversary of that withdraw and that fatal attack at Abbey Gate where 13 service people lost their lives in the ISIS-k suicide bombing. The family members of some of those service people took the stage at the RNC and said that President Biden hasn't spoken their names and how hurtful that was to them.
567,Article 567,Do you think the vice president should speak to that now this week?
568,Article 568,"REPRESENTATIVE PAT RYAN: Well, I'll let the vice president make her decisions about things like that. What I do think we need to recognize is, you want to talk about how we're speaking to veterans and military families. Just ten days ago Donald Trump got up and said, Medal of Honor recipients, the most revered hero's in our country's history, there's only 62 living Medal of Honor recipients in the United States, he directly denigrated and insulted them, on top of years of insulting gold star families, calling our troops suckers and losers. That's something I spoke about at the convention."
569,Article 569,"And I believe we're in a place where the Democratic Party is a party of patriots. Folks voting for Kamala Harris can feel that they are doing - and I certainly feel - their patriotic duty to bring our country together, stop insulting veterans and military families that have made the ultimate sacrifice. And Kamala Harris has done that and - and will continue to do that."
570,Article 570,MARGARET BRENNAN: But it would mean something to those in your district if that loss was acknowledged this week?
571,Article 571,"REPRESENTATIVE PAT RYAN: Wel, I think that it would mean a lot to the family members, of course, to acknowledge their - their loss."
572,Article 572,MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.
573,Article 573,"REPRESENTATIVE PAT RYAN: And, you know, we've lost far too many veterans, not just in active duty combat -"
574,Article 574,MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.
575,Article 575,"REPRESENTATIVE PAT RYAN: But we've talked about this before, coming home. We've now lost more Iraq and Afghanistan veterans to suicide than we lost in active duty."
576,Article 576,MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.
577,Article 577,"REPRESENTATIVE PAT RYAN: So, we need to properly fund the VA. Another thing that Donald Trump failed to do."
578,Article 578,MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.
579,Article 579,"REPRESENTATIVE PAT RYAN: And so it's a - these are important, stark choices ahead."
580,Article 580,"MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman - Congressman, good to have you here."
581,Article 581,"REPRESENTATIVE PAT RYAN: Thanks, Margaret."
582,Article 582,MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back.
583,Article 583,(ANNOUNCEMENTS)
584,Article 584,MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to Republican Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt from Oklahoma City.
585,Article 585,"Good morning to you, Governor."
586,Article 586,"GOVERNOR KEVIN STITT (R-OK): Hey, good morning. Good to be with you."
587,Article 587,"MARGARET BRENNAN: So, one of the biggest drivers of inflation right now are shelter costs. And I know in a previous life you founded a mortgage business. So, I want to tap in to something that's also a problem in Oklahoma, and that is the housing shortage."
588,Article 588,Donald Trump was asked earlier this week when he was out campaigning in Nevada his plan. And he said he would like to release more federal lands to allow homes to be built.
589,Article 589,Is that sufficient?
590,Article 590,"GOVERNOR KEVIN STITT: Well, first off, thanks for - thanks for having me on."
591,Article 591,"You know, I'll tell you this, as a businessman before I became governor, I was in the mortgage business. And the last thing that you want to do is the Kamala - the Vice President Harris plan, which is to put $25,000 more into every single person's pocket for the purpose of buying houses, because if you increase demand without fixing this -"
592,Article 592,MARGARET BRENNAN: But for first-time home owners.
593,Article 593,"GOVERNOR KEVIN STITT: For first-time home buyers, that's correct. But if you throw the demand side up without fixing supply, what happens to pricing? You're actually exasperating the problem. Prices for housing goes up."
594,Article 594,"So, the solution that President Trump's talking about, and it's the correct solution, is to eliminate permitting reform, get permitting reform, make it easier for developers, make it easier for people to develop and build houses, get rid of regulations. That's the - that's the free market principles that we believe in. And we know are the correct way to do it."
595,Article 595,I mean if - when you think about it -
596,Article 596,MARGARET BRENNAN: Well -
597,Article 597,GOVERNOR KEVIN STITT: Listen – go ahead.
598,Article 598,"MARGARET BRENNAN: Sorry. The vice president said she also wants to create 3 million homes. So, she is talking about adding to supply. But on the Republican Party platform, because we went to look at it, it says that Republicans will reduce mortgage rates by slashing inflation - that's really a Fed decision, right - but also open portions of federal lands to allow for new home construction. Sounds very much the same as the Harris plan. And then promote home ownership through tax incentives and support for first-time buyers. Also sounds very similar to the Harris plan. So, what's different?"
599,Article 599,"GOVERNOR KEVIN STITT: Well, first off, there are so many first-time home buyer programs right now. And my question to you - and this is a great question for Vice President Harris - who's going to build the 3 million homes?"
600,Article 600,MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.
601,Article 601,"GOVERNOR KEVIN STITT: I mean, basically, we believe either in a free market system or we believe in government intervention. And so the bottom line is, you're going to drive up the cost - the reason we have 20 percent inflation under a Biden-Harris administration right now is because of all of the attacks on energy, for example, the bureaucracy. We need permitting reform. We need deregulation. We need to unlock American businesses to meet the needs of Americans."
602,Article 602,"Basically, when you have municipalities stopping new developments for lot sizes and for first-time home buyers, that's the things you need to do. By increasing and throwing more money and giving - like, think about it for a second. This ticket - and I know Governor Walz. I'm friends with him in the National Governors Association. He's a nice guy. I've met - I've met Vice President Harris a couple times. She seems like a nice person."
603,Article 603,"But if you think about the Democratic ticket, they've never worked in the private sector. They've - and so their policies are showing that. You can't give every single first-time home buyer $25,000 and expect the prices of houses to come down. That's just not the way the economy works. That's -"
604,Article 604,MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.
605,Article 605,GOVERNOR KEVIN STITT: That's socialism. That's - that's communism.
606,Article 606,"MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, yes. It's not clear what the Republican platform means when they say tax incentives and support for first-time buyers. So, it's not - it's not clear to - how - what their detailed option is when they say also helping those first-time buyers."
607,Article 607,"But on the economy, your state has a law that prohibits an increase of more than 10 percent for the price of goods and services during emergencies. The Harris campaign wants federal restrictions on those kind of price jumps. Why do you oppose it at the federal level if you have something at the state level?"
608,Article 608,"GOVERNOR KEVIN STITT: Well, what we're talking about on the state level, if we have a natural disaster. For example, if there's a tornado that comes through our of our communities, we don't want out-of-state people coming in and price gouging as far as roofing, materials. So, when I declare a national - an executive order and say this area of the state has been hurt, it's for a short period of time. It's maybe for a month. And that's just to protect the people from really people coming in to - to - to try to make money off of this disaster. So, that's totally different than what I see this administration, the Vice President Harris, recommending. So, she's saying - here's - here's the problem that doesn't make sense to the American people, and you need to question her on this. OK, so she's going to tell grocery stores that the maximum you can pay -"
609,Article 609,MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.
610,Article 610,"GOVERNOR KEVIN STITT: For milk and charge for milk is $1.99. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. Well, they're saying they're not doing that."
611,Article 611,"GOVERNOR KEVIN STITT: Well, what happens to the famers if the costs are more than that?"
612,Article 612,MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.
613,Article 613,"GOVERNOR KEVIN STITT: OK, what are they saying they're doing?"
614,Article 614,"MARGARET BRENNAN: I would love to put those questions, but -"
615,Article 615,GOVERNOR KEVIN STITT: What's price control then?
616,Article 616,"MARGARET BRENNAN: I got you for - for a question. You are backing President Trump. Early on you had supported the governor of Florida, Ron DeSantis. And he had warned Republicans about this."
617,Article 617,(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
618,Article 618,GOVERNOR RON DESANTIS (R-FL): You're not going to be talking about the border. You're not going to be talking about the economy. You're going to be talking about all these things to make the election a referendum on Donald Trump.
619,Article 619,"Whereas, if I'm the nominee, we'll be solely focused on the issues that matter to the American people."
620,Article 620,(END VIDEO CLIP)
621,Article 621,MARGARET BRENNAN: Is President Trump getting in his own way on his own messaging?
622,Article 622,"GOVERNOR KEVIN STITT: You know, I'm not going to defend what Vice President Harris said in the convention against President Trump or what President Trump is saying. This is - this is not about winning an argument. And I - and I think the American people are really tired of that."
623,Article 623,Let's - we have to get back to asking questions about policy.
624,Article 624,MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.
625,Article 625,"GOVERNOR KEVIN STITT: And Vice President Harris' policies have led to 20 percent increase in inflation. And I think the American people, at the end of the day -"
626,Article 626,MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.
627,Article 627,"GOVERNOR KEVIN STITT: When they ask themselves, were they better off -"
628,Article 628,MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.
629,Article 629,GOVERNOR KEVIN STITT: When President Trump was in office? The answer is going to be yes.
630,Article 630,MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.
631,Article 631,"GOVERNOR KEVIN STITT: And so, President Trump's the - the nominee. He has the best policies. And I believe he's going to win in November."
632,Article 632,"MARGARET BRENNAN: Governor, thank you for joining us."
633,Article 633,We'll be back in a moment.
634,Article 634,(ANNOUNCEMENTS)
635,Article 635,"MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're joined by former FDA Commissioner, and Pfizer board member, Dr. Scott Gottlieb."
636,Article 636,Good to have you here.
637,Article 637,SCOTT GOTTLIEB (former FDA Commissioner): Good morning.
638,Article 638,"MARGARET BRENNAN: So, this is a Covid summer surge. The CDC says we may be at the peak or about to pass it now."
639,Article 639,The Biden administration has just made free testing available that will come at the end of the month. The new booster shot was just approved. Is this just playing catch up here?
640,Article 640,SCOTT GOTTLIEB: I don't think so. I think the timing's about right in terms of rolling out the vaccine and the tests that will be available for people in the winter time.
641,Article 641,"Look, we've had these summer surges and then a subsequent winter surge now a couple of seasons in a row. So, I think we need to start to understand, this is probably the predictable pattern for this virus for the foreseeable future."
642,Article 642,"It's going to be hard to have a vaccine available earlier than they have had it this year. They've got the vaccine out earlier than they have in the past, in part to try to time it with the flu vaccine, so that when people go into the pharmacy, they can get both a Covid vaccine and a flu vaccine, which I think is going to be important for a lot of older Americans."
643,Article 643,"It is the case that we do see these summer surges, and we will have to think about how we protect people better in the future. I think the idea of having a dual vaccine, having two vaccines per year, that may be a difficult thing just from a manufacturing and a production standpoint."
644,Article 644,"MARGARET BRENNAN: So, this booster is about KP.2 variant."
645,Article 645,SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Right.
646,Article 646,MARGARET BRENNAN: KP.3 is what is swirling around now apparently. It will still protect you?
647,Article 647,"SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Yes, so the data right now, it's pre-clinical data. So, it's data looking at whether or not the antibodies that are produced as a result of getting vaccinated from KP.2 will also neutralize this KP.3 strain. That data looks encouraging. And we rely on that data. That neutralizing antibody days. We've historically relied on it. And it's been a good proxy for how effective the vaccine is going to be."
648,Article 648,"So, this vaccine should protect against KP.3. About a third of the cases of KP.3 right now. I don't believe that the winter surge, and we're likely to see a winter surge of Covid, is going to be from KP.3. Right now, if you look across the country, Covid cases are starting to decline in most parts of the country. Perhaps the northeast is still rising, parts of the west. States like Utah and Colorado. But we should be through most of this summer surge. Cases should start to continue to come down. And in what ultimately emerges in the wintertime, we don't know yet."
649,Article 649,"MARGARET BRENNAN: So, when do you get it? The vaccine, that is. And the guidance from the CDC is, once your fever breaks, count five days and you're good to go. That's not necessarily going to stop transmission, is it?"
650,Article 650,"SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Yes, look, I think people who get Covid and recover from Covid, probably should use an antigen test to see when they're no longer infectious. If you're still registering on an antigen test, you're likely still shedding some virus, although your infectivity probably has come down a lot when you're five, six days out."
651,Article 651,"I think for Americans who are going into settings where there's people who are at risk, where they work in confined spaces, where people may be vulnerable, they may need to take some added precautions if they're recovering from an infection and still testing positive on the antigen test. There's no really, you know, golden rule in terms of when people aren't infective anymore. If you want to be vigilant, use an antigen test to look for that."
652,Article 652,"In terms of when to get the vaccine, for most Americans getting it sometime in September, or maybe early October is going to be sufficient to try to protect them from that winter surge. I think a lot of Americans were worried about the current surge and there's still a lot of virus around, could go out and get the vaccine right now because they could still catch Covid from this current wave of infection."
653,Article 653,"For people who have been infected, they likely have several months of good protection from that recent infection. So, they may want to wait a little bit longer, that way when they do get vaccinated, maybe late October, that vaccine will extend further. Because we know that the immunity provided by the vaccines only lasts a defined period of time, three, four, five months."
654,Article 654,"MARGARET BRENNAN: And it's - it's a serious strain, I'll - I'll - I'll say that. The CDC said that they saw a high number of children under five going to the ER. Why are kids being impacted like that?"
655,Article 655,"SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Well, part of that is that kids don't have baseline immunity. So, a lot of adults have baseline immunity. So, when you look at the statistics on who's going to the emergency room, overall, about 2.4 percent of all emergency room visits are for Covid right now. But for the cohort over the age of 65, that's about 3.4 percent. So, 3.4 percent of all people over the age of 65 who go to the emergency room for any reason are going there for Covid."
656,Article 656,"In children under the age of five, it's 5.8 percent. So, a higher proportion of kids who go to the emergency room are going to the emergency room for Covid. They're getting sick because they don't have baseline immunity. They haven't been infected before. They haven't been vaccinated."
657,Article 657,"I think part of it's also that parents are more likely to take a sick child to the emergency room than take themselves to the emergency room. So, that's some of what's baked into that."
658,Article 658,MARGARET BRENNAN: It's hard to get a kid vaccinated though.
659,Article 659,SCOTT GOTTLIEB: It's hard to -
660,Article 660,MARGARET BRENNAN: To find a -
661,Article 661,SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Find a place that vaccinates toddlers.
662,Article 662,"So, I - if you think of CVS, for example, most of their pharmacies won't vaccinate toddlers. It's only the pharmacies that have mini (ph) clinics. A lot of pediatricians don't stock the under five vaccine because a lot of parents aren't asking for it. If your pediatrician doesn't have the vaccine, and you want to vaccinate your child, you can ask them to order it and it should be available within 24 to 48 hours."
663,Article 663,"MARGARET BRENNAN: All right, Dr. Gottlieb, I have so many more questions for you but we have to leave it there for right now."
664,Article 664,SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Thanks a lot.
665,Article 665,MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back.

678,Article 678,"The following is a transcript of an interview with Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt on ""Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan"" that aired on Aug. 25, 2024."
679,Article 679,"MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to Republican Oklahoma governor, Kevin Stitt from Oklahoma City. Good morning to you. Governor."
680,Article 680,"GOV. KEVIN STITT: Hey, good morning. Good to be with you."
681,Article 681,"MARGARET BRENNAN: So, one of the biggest drivers of inflation right now are shelter costs. And I know in a previous life, you founded a mortgage business, so I want to tap into something that's also a problem in Oklahoma, and that is the housing shortage. Donald Trump was asked earlier this week, when he was out campaigning in Nevada, his plan, and he said he would like to release more federal lands to allow homes to be built. Is that sufficient?"
682,Article 682,"GOV. KEVIN STITT: Well, first off, thanks for- thanks for having me on. You know, I'll tell you this, as a businessman, before I became governor, I was in the mortgage business. And the last thing that you want to do is the Vice President Harris plan, which is to put $25,000 more into every single person's pocket for the purpose of buying houses, because if you increase demand without fixing--"
683,Article 683,MARGARET BRENNAN:-- That's for first time home homeowners--
684,Article 684,"GOV. KEVIN STITT: -- For first time homebuyers, that's correct. But if you throw the demand side up without fixing supply, what happens to pricing? You're actually exasperating the problem, prices for housing goes up. So, the solution that President Trump's talking about is the correct solution is to eliminate permitting reform. Get permitting reform. Make it easier for developers. Make it easier for people to develop and build houses. Get rid of regulations. That's the- that's the free-market principles that we believe in and we know are the correct way to do it. I mean, when you think about it, listen- go ahead."
685,Article 685,"MARGARET BRENNAN: Sorry. The vice president said she also wants to create 3 million homes, so she is talking about adding to supply. But on that the Republican Party platform, because we went to look at it, it says that Republicans will reduce mortgage rates by slashing inflation. That's really a Fed decision, right? But also open portions of federal lands to allow for new home construction, sounds very much the same as the Harris plan, and then promote home ownership through tax incentives and support for first time buyers, also sounds very similar to the Harris plan. So, what's different?"
686,Article 686,"GOV. KEVIN STITT: Well, first off, there are so many first-time homebuyer programs right now, and my question to you, and this is a great question for Vice President Harris, who's going to build the 3 million homes? I mean, basically, we believe either in a free-market system or we believe in government intervention, and so the bottom line is, you're going to drive up the cost. The reason we have 20% inflation under a Biden-Harris administration right now is because of all of the attacks on energy, for example, the bureaucracy we need permitting reform, we need deregulation. We need to unlock American businesses to meet the needs of Americans. Basically, when you have municipalities stopping new developments for lot sizes and for first time homebuyers. That's the things you need to do. By increasing and throwing more money and giving- like think about it for a second, this ticket, and I know Governor Walz, I'm friends with him in the National Governors Association. He's a nice guy. I've met, I've met Vice President Harris a couple times. She seems like a nice person, but if you think about the Democratic ticket, they've never worked in the private sector. They've- so their policies are showing that. You can't give every single first-time home buyer $25,000 and expect the prices of houses to come down. That's just not the way the economy works. That's socialism. That's- that's communism."
687,Article 687,"MARGARET BRENNAN: Well- yeah, it's not clear what the Republican platform means when they say tax incentives and support for first time buyers. So it's not- it's not clear to what their detailed option is when they say, also helping those first time buyers. But on the economy, your state has a law that prohibits an increase of more than 10% for the price of goods and services during emergencies. The Harris campaign wants federal restrictions on those kind of price jumps. Why do you oppose it at the federal level, if you have something at the state level?"
688,Article 688,"GOV. KEVIN STITT: Well, what we're talking about on the state level, if we have a natural disaster, for example, if there's a tornado that comes through one of our communities, we don't want out-of-state people coming in and price gouging as far as roofing materials. So, when I declare a national- an executive order and say, this area of the state has been hurt, it's for a short period of time. It's maybe for a month, and that's just to protect the people from really- people coming in to try to make money off of this disaster. So that's totally different than what I see this administration that Vice President Harris recommending. So, she's saying, here's -here's the problem that doesn't make sense to the American people, and you need to question her on this. Okay- She's going to tell grocery stores that the maximum you can pay for milk and charge for milk is $1.99. But what happens to the farmers if the costs are more than that--"
689,Article 689,MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.
690,Article 690,"GOV. KEVIN STITT: Okay, what are they saying they're doing?"
691,Article 691,MARGARET BRENNAN: I would love to put those questions.
692,Article 692,GOV. KEVIN STITT: What's price control then?
693,Article 693,"MARGARET BRENNAN: I got you for a question. You are backing President Trump. Early on, you had supported the governor of Florida, Ron DeSantis, and he had warned Republicans about this."
694,Article 694,[START SOUND ON TAPE]
695,Article 695,"GOV. RON DESANTIS: You're not going to be talking about the border, you're not going to be talking about the economy. You're going to be talking about all these things to make the election a referendum on Donald Trump, whereas, if I'm the nominee, we'll be solely focused on the issues that matter to the American people."
696,Article 696,[END SOUND ON TAPE]
697,Article 697,MARGARET BRENNAN: Is President Trump getting in his own way on his own messaging?
698,Article 698,"GOV. KEVIN STITT: You know, I'm not going to defend what Vice President Harris said in the convention against President Trump, or what President Trump is saying this. This is not about winning an argument. And I think the American people are really tired of that. Let's- we have to get back to asking questions about policy. And Vice President's Harris ' policies have led to a 20% increase in inflation. And I think the American people at the end of the day, when they- when they ask themselves, were they better off when President Trump was in office? The answer is going to be yes, and so President Trump's the nominee. He has the best policies, and I believe he's going to win in November."
699,Article 699,MARGARET BRENNAN: Governor. Thank you for joining us. We'll be back in a moment.

707,Article 707,"The following is a transcript of an interview with Rep. Summer Lee, Democrat of Pennyslvania, on ""Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan"" that aired on Aug. 25, 2024."
708,Article 708,"MARGARET BRENNAN: Good morning to you, Congresswoman."
709,Article 709,REP. SUMMER LEE: Good morning.
710,Article 710,"MARGARET BRENNAN: Our CBS polling shows that a majority of Americans, 59% of them, think the U.S. should encourage Israel to stop or decrease its military actions in Gaza. At the Democratic Convention. Vice President Harris received loud applause for these remarks:"
711,Article 711,"VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: President Biden and I are working to end this war such that Israel is secure, the hostages are released, the suffering in Gaza ends, and the Palestinian people can realize their right to dignity, security, freedom and self-determination."
712,Article 712,"MARGARET BRENNAN: Now that is largely just restating existing U.S. policy. Do you think that's sufficient outreach to those who felt the administration hasn't expressed empathy,"
713,Article 713,"REP. LEE: You know, I think that, you know, I think people who are experiencing this, right, who were- who were outside of the arena, who have been organizing since October, you know, that is a step, but I think that what they really were asking for was a, of course, the opportunity to speak for themselves. I think that, like all people, when you are experiencing something, you want to be able to tell your own story. And a lot of the people who are Palestinian, Palestinian-American, Arabs and Muslims, were asking for that opportunity. So while, you know, we all obviously believe that there should be a ceasefire immediately and permanently, and that Palestinians, just like Israelis, deserve the right to self-determination. We have to do more than just say that we believe that. We have to actually take steps that are going to evidence that take steps that are going to show that we're willing to start to listen to people who have been outside of the political, I would say, conversation for so long, it's been a third rail, and there's going to be a lot more work that we have to do to show to this demographic that the Democratic Party is- includes them in its big tent, includes them in our foreign policy considerations, and also includes them in our conversations around humanity and human rights."
714,Article 714,"MARGARET BRENNAN: You're talking about the decision at the DNC to deny anyone from the Uncommitted Movement or Palestinian-American to take the stage. Congressman Ro Khanna tweeted, ""it was a tragic mistake perpetuating the erasure of the Palestinian story and voice."" Why do you think Democratic leaders resisted it, and is it a self-inflicted wound?"
715,Article 715,"REP. LEE: I think that there has been, and I think that if you really look at this, long before October 7, it was almost taboo to talk about Palestinians, to talk about the experiences that they have and that they continue to have in our politics. And I think that this was a continuation of it. To put on stage, first of all, I think it's important that we recognize that even the way we talk about the movement is in a way that sometimes is a little wide, it's broad. It doesn't always take into account what folks are arguing about. I think that whether it's the Black lives movement or the movement for Palestinian rights, there's always this rush to say that their movement, the ways that they protest, the tactics, the strategies, are inconvenient, and I think that that's just the way that we've done it. Especially when we're nervous about a presidential election that we all know is incredibly important. Defeating Trump is the top concern, but we can do that, and we can also give space, create space for people, voices that are marginalized. We missed an opportunity to do that here, and in doing so, what we are essentially saying is that every Palestinian thinks the exact same way, that all folks who are protesting, who are voicing their concerns are one group and not individuals, not all folks who are coming with different perspectives. I think that there was room and space to say that. There was room in the Democratic Party for that particular perspective as well."
716,Article 716,"MARGARET BRENNAN: This was a historic nomination of Vice President Harris as the first Black, first South Asian nominee of a major party. She's chosen, really, not to talk about the historic nature of that. Do you think that she should?"
717,Article 717,"REP. LEE: I think that it speaks for itself. You know, I think that there is, you know, zero chance that folks all across America do not recognize that she would be the first Black woman, the first South Asian woman in person, to be not just our party's nominee, but hopefully our president. So to talk about it, it's almost a filler. I think that what's- I think that what they're doing and what they should be doing is talking about the issues. Talking about the things that not are not just unique to women, Black women, Asian women, but actually the things that make her qualified for the job, her resume, the policies that that bring Democrats to- to vote, you know on November 5, those are the things we need to focus on, we all know there's history here."
718,Article 718,"MARGARET BRENNAN: Congresswoman, let's talk about those things on the other side of this next break, stay with us."
719,Article 719,– COMMERCIAL BREAK –
720,Article 720,"MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to Face The Nation. We're continuing our conversation now with Congresswoman Summer Lee of Pennsylvania. Congresswoman, you were talking before the break about the need to focus on issues for- for the campaign. This past week, former Speaker Pelosi stated Vice President Harris will, quote, ""have to"" govern from the center, because ""that's where the public is."" I know you are a progressive Democrat. Do you think that this pivot to the center, particularly on issues like the border and immigration and crime, are they going to hurt support for the Harris-Walz ticket, or is it what's required?"
721,Article 721,"REP. LEE: Yeah, so I have to say, and I like to hope that we're able to do this. I have to- I have to disagree a bit. I think that we have data, we have polling, we have anecdotal evidence from American- Americans all over the country, but especially out in Pennsylvania, in a swing state where we're not actually asking for our candidates to run away from progressive ideals. We're asking them- for them to run to them. You know, there's this idea that to say that, you know, having health care or equitable education, or even talking about, you know, immigration reform and the border in a humane way is somehow to the left, but I think that that's what the average American wants. And I think that in too many, in very many ways, we've ceded ground to Republicans, especially around immigration. They have the tendency of talking about it in an incredibly fear mongering and inhumane way. And I don't think that it's wise that we join them in that. I think people want to see us distinguish ourselves as a party. I think they want to see that we offer solutions for working class people, for marginalized people, and I think that we can do that vocally and proudly and still bring people to the party and not have them run away from it."
722,Article 722,"MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, so that means you disagree with the Harris endorsement of the bipartisan border bill, which was a fairly conservative bill, and that's the policy stated for what the Vice President would enact if she's elected."
723,Article 723,"REP. LEE: I think that what I like to hope- I hope that what I think so many of us want to see, and not just progressives, I mean, even just Democrats, is that we can recognize that we need comprehensive immigration reform. That there are millions of folks in America who are impacted by this, folks who want to come here for a better life, who are looking for opportunities, and they are finding that the pathway, the window to achieving those opportunities, is shutting, not opening. We know that in the past, there were systems in place that- that created an easier pathway for folks who attain citizenship, for folks to work, for folks to contribute, and that's what people want now. And I think that we need to be real about the solutions. What's driving folks to our border and what's driving folks to want to make a life here in the United States at the same time."
724,Article 724,"MARGARET BRENNAN: All right, Congresswoman Lee, thank you for your perspective."

728,Article 728,Title: Notable Deaths in 2024
730,Article 730,Watch CBS News
731,Article 731,ByDavid Morgan
732,Article 732,"Updated on:  August 19, 2024 / 1:29 PM EDT/ CBS News"
733,Article 733,"A look back at the esteemed personalities who left us this year, who'd touched us with their innovation, creativity and humanity."
734,Article 734,By CBSNews.com senior producer David Morgan. The Associated Press contributed to this gallery.
735,Article 735,"BroadcasterPhil Donahue(December 21, 1935-August 18, 2024) pioneered the modern daytime talk show by incorporating audience participation, with guests as varied as Hollywood celebrities and white supremacists, who were questioned by members of the audience and live phone callers."
736,Article 736,"The format of ""The Phil Donahue Show"" set it apart from other daytime shows. Begun in Dayton, Ohio, in 1967, the program was syndicated beginning in 1970. Amiable and deferential to his guests, Donahue could be fearless in addressing hot-button, even taboo topics (his first guest was atheist Madalyn Murray O'Hair). He explored such issues as feminism, homosexuality, civil rights, race, religion, abortion, the Vietnam war, segregation, natural childbirth, orgies, pornography, and new directions in male fashion (which allowed him to wear a skirt). He also hosted movie stars, athletes and politicians, who would face an hour of questions from a demanding audience."
737,Article 737,"Ina 2001 interview with the Television Academy, Donahue proudly proclaimed that his program was the first to feature male strippers. ""I'd like to tell you it was my idea! It wasn't. In fact, when it was suggested — by a woman — first thing I said was, 'Well, where are you gonna put the microphone?' And then when they're not stripping, I mean, what do we talk about? I didn't want to go near this program."" But he did, and it was the audience that came up with question topics: ""They included your mama, your wife, your grandmother, and your baby sister, too,"" he said."
738,Article 738,"""We were naughty before anybody ever heard of shock jocks. We never featured nudity, but we were naughty, and we got our mail and we had sponsors cancel."" They also ran nationally for 26 years, producing more than 6,000 episodes, and won 20 Emmys and  a Peabody Award."
739,Article 739,"Donahue inspired many later talk show hosts, from Oprah Winfrey to Ellen Degeneres. But his willingness to feature titillating topics also inspired Jerry Springer, Morton Downey Jr, and other purveyors of trash TV. As more sensational shows entered the market, Donahue's ratings suffered, and the show ended in 1996. He returned briefly to MSNBC in 2002, but was cancelled after six months."
740,Article 740,"In 2020, Donahue, a self-described feminist,talked with ""CBS Sunday Morning""about his show's popularity among women: ""Well, I had Gloria Steinem on my program very early. All the feminists somehow seemed to, sooner or later, show up on the 'Donahue' show. And we were thrilled with that, because they were good guests, including (Marlo Thomas)."""
741,Article 741,"He met the actress while she was a guest in 1977. They married three years later. In 2020, the year of their 40th anniversary, they jointly wrote a book, ""What Makes a Marriage Last: 40 Celebrated Couples Share with Us the Secrets to a Happy Life."""
742,Article 742,"The smoldering good looks and vulnerable performances of French actorAlain Delon(November 8, 1935-August 18, 2024), whether playing tough guys or tender lovers, made him one of the most appealing stars in world cinema in the 1960s and '70s. He was best known for his work with directors Luciano Visconti (""The Leopard"") and Jean-Pierre Melville (""Le Samouraï"")."
743,Article 743,"Delon made his first big impression in 1960's ""Purple Noon,"" an adaptation of the Patricia Highsmith thriller ""The Talented Mr. Ripley."" He followed with Visconti's ""Rocco and His Brothers""; Michelangelo Antonioni's ""L'Eclisse"" (costarring Monica Vitti); and ""The Leopard,"" as a young and seductive opportunist. The film co-starred Claudia Cardinale and Burt Lancaster."
744,Article 744,"Delon made brief sojourns in Hollywood films, including ""The Yellow Rolls-Royce"" (with Shirley MacLaine), ""Once a Thief"" (with Ann-Margret), and ""Scorpio,"" but most of his successes were in Europe: ""The Girl on a Motorcycle"" (with Marianne Faithfull), ""La Piscine"" (Romy Schneider and Jane Birkin), ""Le cercle rouge,"" ""Borsalino,"" ""The Assassination of Trotsky,"" ""Un flic,"" ""Swann in Love,"" and ""Mr. Klein,"" among the most notable."
745,Article 745,"While also working as a producer, Delon announced his retirement from acting in 1999, only to return in Bertrand Blier's ""Les Acteurs"" that same year. He also appeared in several police shows on TV, and on stage, in 2011, in ""An Ordinary Day,"" with his daughter, Anouchka."
746,Article 746,"He finally did quit acting in 2018,telling British GQwhat he really thought about the film industry today: ""It's a shallow, worthless era soured by money. We no longer film with a moving camera but a digital thing stuck on the end of your fist. No one gives a s*** about anything anymore. … Those who use the phrase 'It was better in my day' are old fools. But when I say it, it's different, because it's true: in my day, it was something else, it really was better. …"
747,Article 747,"""Look, I had incredible luck. I've been happy all my life; I filmed with the best. I did what I wanted, with who I wanted, when I wanted. I dwell on the past more than I think about the future, yes, because my past was extraordinary. Today just doesn't compare. A life like I had doesn't come around twice. That's why when it comes to retirement, I have no regrets."""
748,Article 748,"Though he was criticized for controversial statements he made in his later years regarding women, LGBTQ+ rights, and migrants, and for his support of France's far-right National Front, he was praised upon his death as ""a great friend of animals"" and ""a man with a big heart"" by the Brigitte Bardot Foundation, an organization dedicated to animal protection."
749,Article 749,"Two-time Oscar-nomineeGena Rowlands(June 19, 1930-August 14, 2024) was not only one of the most accomplished and celebrated actresses to appear in front of a camera; she was also a partner with her husband, director John Cassavetes, in crafting groundbreaking films that helped birth the independent cinema movement in the 1960s and '70s – an American counterpart to the French New Wave. Over four decades, Rowlands and Cassavetes made 10 uncompromising films outside the studio system, including ""Faces,"" ""Minnie and Moskowitz,"" ""A Woman Under the Influence,"" ""Opening Night,"" ""Gloria,"" and ""Love Streams."""
750,Article 750,"Speaking to the Associated Press in 2015 about Cassavetes (who died in 1989), Rowlands said, ""He had a particular sympathetic interest in women and their problems in society, how they were treated and how they solved and overcame what they needed to, so all his movies have some interesting women."""
751,Article 751,"Rowlands earned Oscar nominations for her performances in 1974's ""A Woman Under the Influence,"" playing a housewife and mother whose drinking barely masks her vulnerability and chaotic efforts to please; and ""Gloria"" (1980), as a chain-smoking, gun-toting former mobster's moll trying to protect a young boy from murderers while wearing five-inch heels."
752,Article 752,"In 2001 she told The Guardian, ""We totally financed all the films ourselves, except for 'A Woman Under the Influence,' for which [co-star] Peter Falk and his wife paid half. After John had done the screenplay for it, everyone said: 'Why does anyone want to see a picture about a crazy middle-aged dame?' But we were luckier than a lot of young directors now, because we were both established actors, and when we ran out of money (which was all the time), we would stop and each make a movie. It's harder for young writers and directors now, unless they are very wealthy, because whoever puts up the money always has a lot to say."""
753,Article 753,"She and Cassavetes met at the American School of Dramatic Arts, and married four months later. As Cassavetes pursued acting and directing (he financed his first feature, ""Shadows,"" with the money he earned from the TV series ""Johnny Staccato""), Rowlands appeared on live TV and the stage. A role in Paddy Chayefsky's play ""Middle of the Night"" opposite Edward G. Robinson took her to Hollywood, to appear in ""The High Cost of Loving."" Other films included ""Lonely Are the Brave"" with Kirk Douglas; ""The Spiral Road""; ""A Child Is Waiting"" (directed by Cassavetes); ""Two Minute Warning""; ""Tempest"" (directed by Paul Mazursky, and co-starring Cassavetes and Molly Ringwald in her screen debut); Woody Allen's ""Another Woman""; Paul Schrader's ""Light of Day""; and Jim Jarmusch's ""Night on Earth."" She also starred in the TV movie ""An Early Frost,"" as the mother of a young man with AIDS."

757,Article 757,"With a Panama hat, a kazoo, and boundless optimism, entrepreneurWallace ""Wally"" Amos(July 1, 1936-August 13, 2024) created a cookie empire that made his name famous."
758,Article 758,"Born in Tallahassee, Florida, Amos moved to New York City at age 12 because of his parents' divorce. He lived with an aunt, Della Bryant, who taught him how to make chocolate chip cookies. A high school dropout, Amos joined the Air Force, then worked his way up from mailroom clerk to talent agent at the William Morris Agency – the first Black agent in the business, his son, Shawn Amos, said."
759,Article 759,"With $25,000 borrowed from the singers Marvin Gaye and Helen Reddy, Wally launched his cookie business, opening a cookie store on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles in 1975. By its second year, ""Famous Amos"" was selling a million dollars' worth of cookies annually."
760,Article 760,"He eventually lost control of the company, along with rights to the Famous Amos name. In one of his eight books, ""Man With No Name: Turn Lemons Into Lemonade,"" Amos explained how he lost Famous Amos even before it was sold for $63 million to a Taiwanese company in 1991. Despite robust sales, by 1985, the business was losing money, so Amos brought in outside investors. ""The new owners gobbled up more of my share until all of a sudden, I found I had lost all ownership in the company I founded,"" Amos wrote. The company changed ownership four times."
761,Article 761,"Daughter Sarah Amos said that, after parting ways with Famous Amos, her dad stopped baking for about two years. After rediscovering a love of baking, he opened a new cookie store in Honolulu, called Chip & Cookie, in 1991. He also helped build a muffin company, using his own name, Uncle Wally's."
762,Article 762,"Amos had said the Famous Amos cookies sold today are unlike his cookies, which had lots of chocolate, real butter, and pure vanilla extract. ""You can't compare a machine-made cookie with handmade cookie,"" he told the Associated Press. ""It's like comparing a Rolls Royce with a Volkswagen."""
763,Article 763,"He also gave motivational talks to corporations, universities and other groups, and became a children's literacy advocate, serving as spokesperson for Literacy Volunteers of America for 24 years, and cofounding the Chip & Cookie Read Aloud Foundation.

764,Article 764,"Abdul ""Duke"" Fakir(December 26, 1935-July 22, 2024) was the last surviving original member of the Motown group The Four Tops, known for such hits as ""I Can't Help Myself (Sugar Pie, Honey Bunch),"" ""Reach Out I'll Be There,"" and ""Baby I Need Your Loving."""
765,Article 765,"Fakir was not related to his singing partners – Levi Stubbs, Renaldo ""Obie"" Benson, and Lawrence Payton – but they were brothers on the stage since 1954 when they started as the Four Ames, poor kids growing up in Detroit singing on street corners. They spent their early years in small, often segregated clubs, polishing their stage act and versatile vocal style."
766,Article 766,"They finally burst forth in 1964, when Barry Gordy's Motown Records put out ""Baby, I Need Your Loving."" It was a hit. ""We were selling records with 'Baby, I Need Your Loving,'"" Fakir recalled for ""Sunday Morning"" in 1990. ""My mama was really in a bad way. I just asked Barry for an advance. He said, 'Well, how much you need?' And I said, 'About 10,000.' He said, 'What is this for?' And I said, 'I'm going to buy my mama a house.' He said, 'Well, here, take 20,000.' So I just went and bought her a house. Then I bought me 50 pairs of shoes and a Cadillac."""
767,Article 767,"Between 1964 and 1967, The Four Tops had 11 Top 20 hits, including ""It's the Same Old Song,"" ""Something About You,"" ""Shake Me, Wake Me (When It's Over),"" ""Standing in the Shadows of Love,"" ""Bernadette,"" and ""You Keep Running Away."" They also released three albums paired with The Supremes."
768,Article 768,"The hits were fewer after 1970, though 1973's ""Ain't No Woman (Like the One I Got),"" reached #4 when released by ABC/Dunhill, and 1981's ""When She Was My Girl,"" on the Casablanca label, hit #11. But the group, which had separated from Motown when Gordy moved the company to Los Angeles, had money in the bank, and a plan. Fakir recalled, ""We had a meeting about that – 'Look, I think it's slowing down here. It's not coming in every day. It's not falling out the sky, OK? And it's not going to keep doing that. So, now we've got to prepare. If you're not prepared, then let's start preparing for the future and let's take this nice little calm period, enjoy your families, and we'll work when we work and we'll just cool off.'"""
769,Article 769,"Between 1981 and 1995 they released six albums, including ""Indestructible."" But the band's lineup changed with the deaths of Payton in 1997, Benson in 2005, and Stubbs in 2008. Fakir continued touring with new members (including Payton's son, Lawrence Jr.)."
770,Article 770,"""As each one of them (the original members) passed a little bit of me left with them,"" Fakir told UK Music Reviews in 2021. ""When Levi left us, I found myself in a quandary as to what I was going to do from that moment on, but after a while I realized that the name together with the legacy that they had left us simply had to carry on, and judging by the audience reaction, it soon became pretty evident that I did the right thing and I really do feel good about that."""
771,Article 771,"The Four Tops were voted into the Rock Hall of Fame and the Grammy Hall of Fame. Fakir wrote a 2022 memoir, ""I'll Be There,"" and was working on a planned Broadway musical based on their lives."

The writer of ""I'm Your Witchdoctor"", ""Crawling Up a Hill"" and ""Don't Waste My Time,"" Mayall was still performing in his late 80s – and was proud of his low profile."
773,Article 773,"""I've never had a hit record, I never won a Grammy Award, and Rolling Stone has never done a piece about me,"" he said in an interview with the Santa Barbara Independent in 2013.

774,Article 774,"Often called the ""father of British blues,"" Mayall's Bluesbreakers would feature a changing roster of players that included some of the most noteworthy musicians of the era, including Clapton, Fleetwood, McVie, Peter Green, Dick Heckstall-Smith, Jon Hiseman, Harvey Mandel, Jon Mark, Randy Resnick, Larry Taylor, Mick Taylor, Rick Vito and Ernie Watts."
775,Article 775,"Mick Taylor, who succeeded Green as a Bluesbreaker in the late 1960s, said in a 1979 interview with writer Jas Obrecht that Mayall gave his fellow bandmates wide latitude to solo. ""You'd have complete freedom to do whatever you wanted,"" Taylor said. ""You could make as many mistakes as you wanted, too."""
776,Article 776,"Mayall made a permanent move to the U.S. in the late '60s, marked by his 1968 album ""Blues from Laurel Canyon.""

A minimalist, his observational humor, delivered with perfect deadpan timing, cloaked a subversive streak in conjuring ridiculous situations, as when a newly-minted guard at the Empire State Building struggles to find in his employee's manual how to deal with King Kong climbing the façade."
781,Article 781,"""That's the way I've always considered my comedy, is being the last sane man and going to people and saying, 'Excuse me, but isn't this crazy?'""he told ""Sunday Morning"" in 2002."
782,Article 782,"Born outside of Chicago during the Great Depression, with a stammer that only seemed to accentuate his dry wit, Newhart served in the Army, flunked out of law school, and became an accountant. He admits he wasn't good with numbers, but hewasgood at making people laugh. Delivery was key. He admitted that while his pieces might not seem funny on paper (a Madison Avenue ad man criticizing Abe Lincoln's Gettysburg Address), his cadences would sell them."
783,Article 783,"He actually started off with a writing partner, but after they split up, Newhart performed solo, reacting to an unseen partner on the other end of his phone conversations – which made the bits even funnier. Here he is imagining the boss back in Old England getting a phone call from Sir Walter Raleigh about a New World discovery: ""Are, are you sayingsnuff, Walt? Uh-huh. And what's snuff? … You take a pinch of tobacco and … and you stick it up your nose, and … and it makes you sneeze. I imagine it would, Walt, yeah."""

Broadcast in 1973-74, the show, which featured several future cast members of ""Saturday Night Live"" (including John Belushi, Chevy Chase, Bill Murray, Brian Doyle-Murray, Gilda Radner, Christopher Guest and Billy Crystal), was a wild and inventive parody of the media world that helped birth a generation of comedic talents in TV and films."
792,Article 792,"Tischler recorded the actors' improvisations in a studio built at the National Lampoon magazine offices in New York City, then cut the tape with razor blades. (This was pre-digital.) Some of the more outré material cost the show sponsors (7-Up didn't appreciate their commercial being led in to by a reference to Nazis), and radio stations would pre-empt the show if it were too outrageous (such as their episode devoted to bringing back the death penalty). ""Basically, our assignment was to do whatever the hell we wanted to do,"" Tischler wrote in the liner notes of a 1996 ""Radio Hour"" box set. ""No executives or censors were to be involved. … Except for a few of the more courageous record companies, national advertisers stayed away in droves."""

Tischler produced albums for Belushi's Blues Brothers act, including the #1 hit, ""Briefcase Full of Blues.""

Duvall would go on to appear in Altman's ""McCabe & Ms. Miller,"" ""Thieves Like Us,"" ""Nashville,"" ""Buffalo Bill and the Indians, or Sitting Bull's History Lesson,"" ""Popeye,"" and ""3 Women,"" for which she won the best actress award at the Cannes Film Festival."

But her most vivid role was as Wendy Torrance, trapped at the isolated Overlook Hotel with a husband going insane, in ""The Shining.""

829,Article 829,"Towne cut his teeth on TV (""The Man from U.N.C.L.E.,"" ""The Outer Limits,"" ""The Lloyd Bridges Show"") and B-movies for producer Roger Corman (""Last Woman on Earth,"" ""Tomb of Ligeia""). In a showbiz story that rivals Lana Turner being discovered at the soda counter at Schwab's Pharmacy, Towne was said to owe his first big break to his psychiatrist, through whom he met a fellow patient, Warren Beatty. The actor-producer asked Towne to revise the Robert Benton-David Newman script for ""Bonnie and Clyde,"" and invited him to the set during filming."
830,Article 830,"The movie, though controversial for its violence, became a modern classic. And while Benton and Newman shared an Oscar nomination, the anonymous Towne launched a career as an uncredited ghostwriter and script doctor. He contributed to the screenplays of ""The Godfather"" (creating Vito and Michael Corleone's father-son talk in the garden), ""Drive, He Said, "" ""McCabe & Mrs. Miller,"" ""The Parallax View,"" ""The Missouri Breaks"" and ""Heaven Can Wait"" – films that heralded a revolutionary new cinema in the 1970s."
831,Article 831,"He won an Oscar for his original screenplay for ""Chinatown,"" Roman Polanski's acidic take on corruption in 1930s Los Angeles. Inspired by the works of Raymond Chandler, and by the real-life machinations behind L.A.'s expansion, Towne crafted a film noir classic that featured iconic performances by Jack Nicholson (Towne's former roommate), Faye Dunaway and John Huston."
832,Article 832,"In 2009 he told The Hollywood Reporterthe origin of ""Chinatown"" was a book he checked out of the library called ""Southern California Country: Island on the Land,"" which covered the perilous history of water in Los Angeles. ""I thought, 'Why not do a picture about a crime that's right out in front of everybody? Instead of a jewel-encrusted falcon, make it something as prevalent as water faucets, and make a conspiracy out of that. And after reading about what they were doing, dumping water and starving the farmers out of their land, I realized the visual and dramatic possibilities were enormous. So, that was really the beginning of it."""
833,Article 833,"But the ending became a source of contention; Towne wanted Huston's character to die and Dunaway's to live; Polanski wanted the opposite, and filmed it that way."
834,Article 834,"Towne wrote what was essentially half a screenplay for ""Greystoke,"" building on the legend of Tarzan, and traded away his rights to the hot property for money to complete his directorial debut, ""Personal Best."" ""Chariots of Fire"" director Hugh Hudson came in and finished ""Greystoke"" with another writer. Dismissive of the finished product, Towne took his name off the script, replacing it with that of his sheepdog. Hollywood being Hollywood, the dog, ""P.H. Vazak,"" earned an Oscar nomination for best adapted screenplay."
835,Article 835,"Towne directed his own script for ""Tequila Sunrise,"" and wrote a sequel to ""Chinatown,"" called ""The Two Jakes,"" which Nicholson directed.

842,Article 842,"Friedman, the son of Russian Jewish immigrants, earned a cult following, and a reputation as a provocateur. In the 1970s he led a country band mischievously named Kinky Friedman and the Texas Jewboys, singing such songs as ""They Ain't Makin' Jews Like Jesus Anymore,"" ""The Ballad of Charles Whitman"" (an ode to the Texas Tower sniper), and ""Get Your Biscuits in the Oven and Your Buns in Bed."" [The National Organization of Women did not approve.] Friedman also toured with Bob Dylan and Willie Nelson."

845,Article 845,"Friedman ran for Texas Governor in 2006 as an independent, with the slogan, ""How Hard Could It Be?"" Some saw the campaign as another Friedman joke, but he insisted it was serious. His platform called for legalizing medical marijuana, boosting public education spending through casino gambling, and backing same-sex marriage. ""I support gay marriage,"" he told ""Sunday Morning,"" ""because I believe they have a right to be just as miserable as the rest of us."" He came in fourth, with 12.4% of the vote."
846,Article 846,"But not all of his energies were to the humorous, or the Quixotic. In the 1990s he founded an animal rescue, Utopia Animal Rescue Ranch, in Medina, Texas, where he saved more than a thousand dogs and cats from being euthanized, and housed strays awaiting adoption. ""I have always felt that what we do when a stray spirit crosses our path – how we react to the hungry, homeless stranger – is indubitably a measure of our own humanity,""he wrote in Texas Monthly in 2005."

848,Article 848,"Canadian actorDonald Sutherland(July 17, 1935-June 20, 2024) brought a terrific off-kilter quality to his performances in a six-decade career that stretched from heroes to anti-heroes, from leading man to reliable character actor. He became most identified with his roles in the counter-culture war comedy ""MASH,"" the wrenching family drama ""Ordinary People,"" the farcical ""National Lampoon's Animal House,"" the conspiracy thriller ""JFK,"" and the dystopian ""Hunger Games"" series – a testament to his incredible range."
849,Article 849,"In his time Sutherland portrayed a wealth of rebels, ruffians and iconoclasts, whose distaste for playing by the rules was searing, and often very funny. So strong was the stamp of a Sutherland rebel that, when he did play a figure of authority, tradition, or cloak-and-dagger subterfuge, the audience was forgiven for believing that his tongue - when speaking of order and control - was very much in his cheek."
850,Article 850,"Born in New Brunswick and raised in Nova Scotia, Sutherland switched his studies from engineering to English and began acting while at university. He later attended the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art, and appeared on stage in the West End and on U.K. television. His early film credits included the British ""Dr. Terror's House of Horrors."""
851,Article 851,"His first major Hollywood role was in ""The Dirty Dozen"" (1967), as the psychopathic prisoner-turned-commando Vernon Pinkley. Sutherland's star burned even brighter with his roles in a pair of anti-establishment war films: as nonconformist Army surgeon Hawkeye Pierce in Robert Altman's ""MASH,"" and as a tank commander (nicknamed ""Oddball"") who helps plot a gold heist in the WWII comedy ""Kelly's Heroes."""
852,Article 852,"""There is more challenge in character roles,"" Sutherland told The Washington Post in 1970. ""There's longevity. A good character actor can show a different face in every film and not bore the public."""

860,Article 860,"The talent, drive and exuberance ofWillie Mays(May 6, 1931-June 18, 2024) made him one of baseball's greatest players, and possibly the most beloved by fans."
861,Article 861,"The son of a Negro League player, Mays himself was a gifted athlete who began his professional career in the Negro Leagues in 1948, before being brought into the majors by the New York Giants. But when he first arrived, Mays was hitless in his first series. In 1979he told ""Sunday Morning""how Giants manager Leo Durocher boosted his confidence: ""Leo gave me what you call motivation. The only thing he told me, just a couple lines: 'You'll be my center fielder as long as I'm manager here, and you really don't have to hit. Just go out and play center field.' And I think by saying that, I think I relaxed a little bit, and I just started hitting without any problem."" In fact, in his first year with the Giants, Mays hit .274 with 127 hits, including 20 homers, and scored 59 runs, earning him the National League Rookie of the Year Award."
862,Article 862,"Over 23 seasons, beginning with the Birmingham Black Barons in the Negro Leagues, and then with the Giants, in New York and San Francisco, and then back in New York with the Mets, Mays racked up 3,293 hits, including 660 home runs (only Babe Ruth and Hank Aaron, at that time, had more), 1,909 RBIs, and a .301 batting average, not to mention 339 stolen bases, a Gold Glove, and two MVP Awards."
863,Article 863,"But from his entire career on the field, his most memorable play was undoubtedly ""The Catch,"" in Game 1 of the 1954 World Series. With the score tied in the top of the eighth and with two men on base, Cleveland's Vic Mertz hit a drive deep to center field. Racing to the wall, Mays made a basket catch over his shoulder, his back to home plate, and quickly turned to fire the ball back to the infield, preventing two or three runs. The Giants won the game, and the championship."
864,Article 864,"Mays talked with ""Sunday Morning"" about the importance of being what he called a ""complete ball player."" ""You can't just run and not hit, or hit home runs, or hit for a batting average. I was active on the ball field, and I had to please the stand just as well as [if] I was on stage or something. When I went to the ball park, I tried to do things a little different sometimes and make sure the fans got their money's worth."""
865,Article 865,"Mays' exuberance earned him the nickname ""Say Hey Kid,"" and his attention to young fans earned him lasting affection. In 2011, visiting the site of the Polo Grounds in Manhattan, Mays talked of how youngsters would invite him to play in their stickball games. ""I used to have maybe 10 kids come to my window,"" he said. ""Every morning, they'd come at 9 o'clock. They'd knock on my window, get me up. … They'd give me a chance to go shower. They'd give me a chance to eat breakfast. But I had to be out there at 9:30, because that's when they wanted to play. So, I played with them for about maybe an hour."""
866,Article 866,Mays was voted into the Hall of Fame in 1979 (his first year of eligibility). In 2015 he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom.
867,Article 867,"""It was ironic that we'd done all this work to come and explore the moon, and what we really discovered was the Earth,"" astronautWilliam Anders(Oct. 17, 1933-June 7, 2024), a member of the Apollo 8 crew,told ""CBS Sunday Morning"" in 2018."
868,Article 868,"Fifty years prior, on Christmas Eve, Anders, James Lovell and Frank Borman became the first humans to orbit the moon. Describing the crater-covered lunar surface proved almost as difficult as getting there. ""I said that it looked like dirty beach sand,"" Anders recalled. ""That's how I described it, thus gaining the wrath of poets worldwide!"""
869,Article 869,"But it was a photo that Anders took of the Earth, rising above the moon like a big blue marble, that brought all of humanity – everything that mankind had ever known – together in a brilliant, fragile image. Anders took some of the precious little film they had on board – film that was supposed to be used for capturing the moon – to take the picture of our home world. Anders said, ""Even though that wasn't in the flight plan ... hell with that, you know? Here was a beautiful shot."""
870,Article 870,"Known as ""Earthrise,"" it became one of the most reproduced images ever, in part because no other photograph summed up our place in the universe quite like it. It was reproduced on a postage stamp, and became a catalyst for the environmental movement. Life magazine featured it on the cover of its 2003 anthology, ""100 Photographs That Changed the World."""
871,Article 871,"Born in Hong Kong (his father was a Navy officer), Anders was graduated from the Naval Academy, but accepted his wings in the Air Force, rising to major. He also earned a master's degree in nuclear engineering, before joining NASA."
872,Article 872,"Retiring from active duty following the Apollo mission, Anders served on the National Aeronautics and Space Council, the Atomic Energy Commission, and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and as ambassador to Norway. He retired from the Air Force Reserve as a major general in 1988, and co-founded the Heritage Flight Museum in Bellingham, Wash."
873,Article 873,"""Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious"" may appear unspeakable, but it's one of the most fondly remembered lyrics from the songwriting team the Sherman Brothers, who created catchy classics for ""Mary Poppins,"" ""The Jungle Book"" and ""Chitty Chitty Bang Bang"" – songs that were infectious, ubiquitous and unforgettable."
874,Article 874,"""They call it an earworm – you know, you can't get it out of your ear. It just crawls in there and stays,""Richard Sherman(June 12, 1928-May 25, 2024)told ""CBS Sunday Morning"" in 2013. He was clear-eyed about their theme park perennial, ""It's a Small World (After All),"" introduced at the 1964 World's Fair. In a 2011 appearance at the Walt Disney Family Museum in San Francisco, Sherman said of the reaction to that song, ""People either want to kiss us or kill us!"""
875,Article 875,"Growing up, older brother Robert Sherman aspired to write novels; Richard, symphonies. One day their songwriting father gave them a challenge: ""'I bet you couldn't team up together and write a song that some kid would give up his lunch money to buy a record of it … Yeah, I don't think you have enough brains to do that.' And he turned around and left,"" Richard recalled."
876,Article 876,"Within a decade the brothers had had hits recorded by Annette Funicello (""Tall Paul,"" ""Wild Willie""), Johnny Burnette (""You're Sixteen""), and Fabian (""Got the Feeling"")."

878,Article 878,"But their most famous tunes were from ""Mary Poppins,"" inspired by P.L. Travers' magical nanny. ""A Spoonful of Sugar,"" ""Chim Chim Cher-ee,"" ""Jolly Holiday,"" ""Let's Go Fly a Kite,"" and the irrepressibly bouncy ""Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious."""

881,Article 881,"In a 1969 interview with the Los Angeles Times, Robert Sherman (who died in 2012) explained the songwriting approach taken by himself and Richard: ""We don't like the dark side of things, and we only want to entertain people.

882,Article 882,"""I wouldn't describe myself as a miserable person, but there are those who would say that my outlook on humanity is pretty miserable,"" writerCaleb Carr(August 2, 1955-May 23, 2024)told ""CBS Sunday Morning"" in 2005. He came to wide attention with his bestselling 1994 novel ""The Alienist,"" about the hunt for a serial killer in 19th century New York City, in a neighborhood that, he wrote, ""knew little of laws, man-made or otherwise."""
883,Article 883,"He followed ""The Alienist"" with a sequel, ""The Angel of Darkness,"" and with a Sherlock Holmes mystery, ""The Italian Secretary."" ""It was just supposed to be a little cottage industry that would give me a stipend to live off of while I was doing the work that I had always done and was trained to do,"" he explained."
884,Article 884,"Carr's true calling was military history, as an editor of the Quarterly Journal of Military History, and as a college professor at Bard College outside New York City."
885,Article 885,"He grew up on New York's Lower East Side, a then-crime-filled neighborhood where violence was a part of everyday life, including at home. ""My father was a violent person by nature,"" Carr said. ""He was a tempestuous person, and my father told me repeatedly nobody likes a smart-ass."" And what effect did that have? ""Made me that much more of a smart-ass every time he said it. It's what happens with children if it's accompanied by a swift smack to the back of your head."""
886,Article 886,"His father, Lucien, a news editor and member of the Beat poets' coterie, killed a man when he was 19, and served two years in prison before being pardoned. Carr said his father never spoke about it, which gave him more of a desire to figure out where personal violence comes from."
887,Article 887,"In the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, Carr published ""The Lessons of Terror."" He traced 2,000 years of war, arguing that strategies that target civilians have always ultimately failed. ""We must develop a way for American military power to be projected in a more enlightened fashion,"" he said. ""We have to, or the entire world – even more of the world that hates us now – will hate us later."""
888,Article 888,"He also co-wrote ""America Invulnerable: The Quest for Absolute Security from 1812 to Star Wars"" (1989), and ""Killing Time"" (2000), a dystopian murder mystery set in the Information Age."
889,Article 889,"And beyond military history and period thrillers, Carr also worked on the libretto of an opera, ""Merlin,"" about the magician in King Arthur's court. ""Traditional styles are very comforting to me,"" he said. ""The modern world is a very uncomfortable place for me. … It's hard to look at the modern world as a student of the things that I study and see it as anything but pretty horrendous. It's not a comfortable place in terms of where our values are going. We are heading into a very dark age."""
890,Article 890,"His final published work was the 2024 memoir of his devoted cat, Masha: ""My Beloved Monster: Masha, the Half-Wild Rescue Cat Who Rescued Me."""
891,Article 891,"But despite his intimations of misery, he praised his students, who are studying the past in hopes of changing the future. ""They're all interested in it.

895,Article 895,"He carried the character over into the spinoff series, ""Fernwood Tonight."""
896,Article 896,"Then came the revenge comedy ""9 to 5,"" in which he played Franklin Hart, the sexist, conspiratorial boss who gets his comeuppance from female staffers played by Jane Fonda, Lily Tomlin and Dolly Parton.

In 1959, New York's Museum of Modern Art put some of his ""Black Paintings"" in a show, and then bought one. The New Yorker would later write that Stella's impact on abstract art was akin to Bob Dylan's on music."

And the audience has a high level of expectation and, if they get something that they like and then they're told it'snotgreat, they feel that they've done something wrong. I mean, they feel they should only focus on the 'great' things. And the artists feel that they should only make 'great' paintings, you know?

925,Article 925,"As Stella pushed the boundaries of abstraction with his paintings and prints, along the way he developed a few artistic obsessions. The painted surfaces of canvases and paper became the painted surfaces of assemblages and sculptures made out of slick fiberglass or aluminum tubing, including some in the shape of a star. (Frank's surname in Italian does meanstar.) Carbon fiber materials and 3-D printing allowed Stella to explore ever-more challenging shapes, creating stars that stood 21 feet high."
926,Article 926,"Stella said he wasn't one to consider his legacy. ""I went from being a young artist to a middle-aged artist to a mature artist, and now I'm an 'is-he-still-alive?' artist,"" the octogenarian told ""Sunday Morning"" in 2021. ""It would be probably a lot more satisfying to people if I'd started out likethis, and then ended up with the black paintings.

Pinder played keyboards, and helped promote the Mellotron (an electronic instrument with two keyboards that incorporated tape loops) to become a familiar sound in rock music."
935,Article 935,"Having worked at the Mellotron factory, Pinder was familiar with the instrument's quirks, and mastered it in the band's second album, ""Days of Future Passed"" (1967).

936,Article 936,"Ina 2018 interview with Rolling Stone, Pinder explained his fascination with the Mellotron: ""I grew up listening to the music of Mantovani and the layers of rich and melodious string arrangements that were his trademark. The Mellotron enabled me to create my own variations of string movements. I could play any instrument that I wanted to hear in the music. If I heard strings, I could play them with the Mellotron. If I heard cello, brass, trumpets or piano, I could play them."""
937,Article 937,"With ""Days of Future Passed"" (which was originally envisioned by Decca as a demonstration album of its recording technology for both classical and rock fans), the Moody Blues connected their progressive rock tracks with orchestral arrangements by Peter Knight, into a concept album of a day's passing.

941,Article 941,"A descendant of Canadian fiddlers, Betts was born and raised in Florida, and played the ukulele and banjo before focusing on electric guitar, because it impressed girls. After he and Berry Oakley played together in the band Second Coming, the two joined forces with Gregg and Duane Allman, Butch Trucks and Jai Johanny ""Jaimoe"" Johanson to form the Allman Brothers Band in 1969. They were pioneers for ignoring the traditional formula of pop songs (individual tracks might take up the entire side of an LP), and for being a biracial group from the Deep South. Betts shared lead guitar duties with Duane Allman."

You learn so much and become a richer person by surrounding yourself with people who are different from you.

986,Article 986,"A native of San Francisco, Serra originally studied painting at Yale University but turned to sculpting in the 1960s. His choice of materials may have been inevitable; his father worked in a shipyard, and Serra put himself through college as a steelworker. This lifelong familiarity with weight and mass is probably the reason he was unfazed by what it takes to make, move and install works that weigh tons."
987,Article 987,"His sculptures have always been about changing perceptions of time and space – of weight and weightlessness. ""The content of the pieces is really determined by the viewer,""Serra told ""Sunday Morning"" in 1998. ""The subject of these pieces is the viewer. You're the subject of these pieces."""

995,Article 995,"""Every time, you try and figure something individual that works for the character. If you're playing a villain, you don't play villain. My character in 'Blood Simple,' Visser, doesn't think of himself as particularly bad or evil. He's on the edge of what's legal, but he's having a lot of fun with all that. He's a simple fella trying to make an extra buck and going a little further than he'd normally go in his business enterprises."""

""I haven't done monologues since 1982 – all because of Letterman,"" he said. ""He changed my life as a comedian when he got his show. He gave me my first big break.

1017,Article 1017,"An attorney who did a fellowship at Yale University, Navalny gained notoriety by attacking corruption within Russia's political and business worlds. By focusing on the notion of ordinary Russians being cheated rather than on human rights abuses, Navalny's investigations (such as revealing the ostentatious country estates of the politically-connected) went viral on social media, resonating with younger Russians far from Moscow and St. Petersburg. It helped him establish a network of regional offices for his group, the Anti-Corruption Foundation, and allowed unprecedented rallies against the ruling party, protesting suspicious election results."
1018,Article 1018,"He was convicted in 2013 of embezzlement (he denounced the charges as political retribution) and was sentenced to five years in prison, but later released, his sentence suspended following protests in the capital."

1064,Article 1064,"But not everyone in the audience was a fan. ""We actually had a death threat in the newsroom,"" Osgood recalled in 2016. ""Somebody called up and he said, 'Tell Osgood that if he does any more of those stupid poems, I'm gonna kill him!'"""
1065,Article 1065,"Among his broadcasting honors, Osgood received the George Foster Peabody Award, the National Association of Broadcasters Distinguished Service Award, and five Emmys, including a lifetime achievement honor in 2017. He was inducted into the National Association of Broadcasters Hall of Fame in 1990, and the Broadcasting and Cable Hall of Fame in 2000."
1066,Article 1066,"He also wrote numerous books, including ""A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the White House,"" ""Nothing Could Be Finer Than a Crisis That Is Minor in the Morning,"" ""There's Nothing I Wouldn't Do if You Would Be My POSSLQ,"" and his childhood reminiscence, ""Defending Baltimore Against Enemy Attack."""
1067,Article 1067,"But he was more than a storyteller; he could also play piano, organ, banjo, violin, and was an accomplished composer and lyricist. (He had a Top 40 hit in 1966 with his ballad for the armed forces, ""Gallant Men."") He also performed with The New York Pops, The Boston Pops and The Mormon Tabernacle Choir."
1068,Article 1068,"Musical satiristPeter Schickele(July 17, 1935-January 16, 2024) made a name for himself as a performer and a composer of music for the concert hall and films. But his name was overshadowed by that of his creation: P.D.Q. Bach, described as the least talented of Johann Sebastian Bach's 20-ish children, whose compositions would, in the words of Schickele, ""catapult him into obscurity."" No one knew the composer even existed until Schickele said he discovered one of P.D.Q. Bach's manuscripts being used as a coffee strainer at a castle in Bavaria."
1069,Article 1069,"The satirist actually created P.D.Q. while on the faculty of the Juilliard School of Music in New York, creating works for the concert hall that lampooned classical music tropes, while adding unusual instruments (shower hose, police siren) in the mix. Schickele's musical heroes included Bach, Beethoven, Brahms, and Spike Jones. ""I grew up with the Three Stooges, as well as Bach and Mozart, and it's all there,"" he told ""Sunday Morning"" in 1984."
1070,Article 1070,"""Most satirists make fun of what they like, not what they don't like; and so, musically, it's very much a satire of love,"" Schickele said. ""I think the only aspect of it that I wouldn't mind seeing changed a bit is the aura of sort of sacredness that surrounds the concert scene."""
1071,Article 1071,"The titles were punny enough: ""Hansel & Gretel & Ted & Alice"" (which Schickele called ""an opera in one unnatural act""),   ""Concerto for Horn and Hardart,"" ""Eine Kleine Nichtmusik,"" ""Erotica Variations,"" ""Fanfare for the Common Cold,"" ""The Short-Tempered Clavier,"" ""Concerto for Piano vs. Orchestra,"" ""The Only Piece Ever Written for Violin and Tuba,"" and a ""simply grand"" opera titled ""The Abduction of Figaro."""
1072,Article 1072,"He would spend half the year writing serious compositions, and the other half doing P.D.Q. Bach music, which was released as albums, such as ""The Stoned Guest,"" ""Music You Can't Get Out of Your Head,"" and ""1712 Overture and Other Musical Assaults."" His book, ""The Definitive Biography of P.D.Q. Bach,"" sold 100,000 copies."
1073,Article 1073,"If there is one characteristic of P.D.Q. Bach's music that stands out above all others, it's what Schickele referred to as ""manic plagiarism."" ""Now, many 18th century composers, sometimes even the greatest ones, like Haydn and Mozart, would occasionally use a theme by one of their colleagues, but I think P.D.Q. Bach was the only composer who worked on tracing paper,"" Schickele said, introducing one of P.D.Q.'s pieces."
1074,Article 1074,"Classical music may be serious business, but not when Schickele was involved. At performances in which he introduced the discoveries of yet more P.D.Q. works, he might arrive via a rope dangling from the balcony."
1075,Article 1075,"Schickele told ""Sunday Morning"" that rehearsals are important, if only to prevent fits of laughter from affecting the musicians' playing: ""One of the reasons we have rehearsals is so that musicians can laugh. But, hopefully, in the performance, musicians are going to have heard the music enough so that they can control themselves, particularly the wind players, of course, we're concerned about, because the string players can laugh and still keep going, but the wind players definitely pose a problem."""
1076,Article 1076,"Veteran stage and television actorJoyce Randolph(October 21, 1924-January 13, 2024) was best remembered as Trixie, the wife of the dim Ed Norton, on the classic sitcom ""The Honeymooners."" She was the last surviving cast member of the beloved sitcom that also starred Jackie Gleason, Audrey Meadows and Art Carney."
1077,Article 1077,"Originating as a skit on Gleason's 1950s variety show, ""Cavalcade of Stars,"" ""The Honeymooners"" became a series of its own in 1955. Its one season on CBS, comprised of 39 episodes, would entertain generations in syndicated reruns."
1078,Article 1078,"Randolph retired from acting once the show ended, partly because the oversized impact of the character meant she was typecast. Active with fundraisers, Broadway openings and the U.S.O., Randolph said she didn't fully realize the impact of the show until her son attended college in the early 1980s. ""He came home and said, 'Did you know that guys and girls come up to me and ask, 'Is your mom really Trixie?'"" she told The San Antonio Express in 2000. ""I guess he hadn't paid much attention before then."""
1079,Article 1079,"Ina 2007 interview with The New York Times, Randolph said she received no royalties from the syndication of the original episodes, but did so once ""lost"" episodes – sketches repackaged from Gleason's variety shows – were aired."
1080,Article 1080,"British actressGlynis Johns(October 5, 1923-January 4, 2024) was best-known on screen for her portrayal of a suffragette and mother in the Disney classic ""Mary Poppins,"" and on stage for her Tony-winning turn in Stephen Sondheim's ""A Little Night Music."""
1081,Article 1081,"Johns was the fourth generation of actors in her family (she was born in Pretoria, South Africa, because her parents were touring at the time), and was first carried on stage at age three weeks. She was performing on London's West End by age 14. Her early film credits included ""49th Parallel,"" ""The Magic Box,"" ""The Sword and the Rose,"" ""Rob Roy: The Highland Rogue,"" ""The Beachcomber,"" ""The Court Jester,"" ""Around the World in 80 Days,"" ""Loser Take All,"" ""Another Time, Another Place,"" ""Shake Hands with the Devil,"" ""The Spider's Web,"" ""The Chapman Repot,"" and ""The Sundowners,"" for which she received an Oscar nomination for best supporting actress."
1082,Article 1082,"In 1963 she starred in the comedy series ""Glynis,"" playing a mystery writer-turned-amateur sleuth."
1083,Article 1083,"The following year she played Mrs. Banks opposite Julie Andrews' magical nanny in ""Mary Poppins."" Meeting with Walt Disney (who had produced a couple of her '50s films), she agreed to consider taking the role if she had a solo number in the musical. Disney promised her that he had one specially for her – and then, raced over to the Sherman Brothers to ask them to hurriedly write a solo number for Mrs. Banks."
1084,Article 1084,"On stage Johns starred in a 1956 Broadway production of George Bernard Shaw's ""Major Barbara,"" directed by Charles Laughton, and, in 1963, Shaw's ""Too True to Be Good."" She also starred in a stage version of the comedy ""Harold and Maude."" In 1973 she won a Tony for ""A Little Night Music,"" starring as Desiree Armfeldt, an actress whose fame is fading. Sondheim wrote the show's breakout song, the melancholy ""Send in the Clowns,"" for Johns' distinctive husky voice, while she was in rehearsals."
1085,Article 1085,"""I've had other songs written for me, but nothing like that,"" Johns told the AP in 1990. ""It's the greatest gift I've ever been given in the theater."""
1086,Article 1086,"She also starred in the 1989 Broadway revival of W. Somerset Maugham's romantic comedy ""The Circle,"" with Rex Harrison and Stewart Granger."
1087,Article 1087,"Known as a perfectionist, she took roles that were complicated and multi-faceted. ""As far as I'm concerned, I'm not interested in playing the role on only one level,"" she told The Associated Press in 1990. ""The whole point of first-class acting is to make a reality of it. To be real. And I have to make sense of it in my own mind in order to be real."""
1088,Article 1088,"Though she had, by her accounts, retired ""many times,"" she kept returning to acting, with appearances on TV (""Batman,"" ""Little Gloria … Happy at Last,"" ""The Love Boat,"" ""Cheers,"" ""Murder, She Wrote"") and films (""The Ref,"" ""While You Were Sleeping,"" ""Superstar""). ""The theater is just part of my life,"" she told the AP. ""It probably uses my highest sense of intelligence, so therefore I have to come back to it, to realize that I've got the talent. I'm not as good doing anything else."""

1565,Article 1565,"Tell me, was this friendly fire? Did Hezbollah, as they claim, actually cause some Israeli casualties?"
1566,Article 1566,"AMBASSADOR MICHAEL HERZOG: So, what happened yesterday is that we identify concrete planning and preparation by Hezbollah to launch a massive missile and drone attack into Israel, and we carried the real-time operation in order to degrade those capabilities that were about to be launched at Israel."
1567,Article 1567,"We were successful. Nevertheless, they launched several hundred rockets into Israel and also drones that were aimed at Central Israel, and we intercepted all of them. One of our soldiers was killed by the debris of Israeli interceptors."

1569,Article 1569,AMBASSADOR MICHAEL HERZOG: I believe that the success of our operation yesterday prevented an escalation to a major war.
1570,Article 1570,The threat is still there. We still need a settlement with Hezbollah in Southern Lebanon. They followed Hamas by launching the war with Israel on October 8. And they have been firing thousands of rockets into Israel since then.

1573,Article 1573,It's being reported that Israel and Hezbollah have been trading messages back and forth not to escalate. I know that the Qatari prime minister is headed to Iran tomorrow with a message not to escalate. Do you believe that you can avoid a direct attack by Iran on Israel?
1574,Article 1574,AMBASSADOR MICHAEL HERZOG: I believe so.
1575,Article 1575,"I think the Iranians are contemplating an attack on Israel, but decided for now to put it on hold. And I think the main reason for that was deterrent messages from Israel and the U.S. and a very strong U.S. posture in the region, which tells you that you can deter them."
1576,Article 1576,"MARGARET BRENNAN: There are 40,000 U.S. troops now in the region. What is it that you think General C.Q. Brown will do when he arrives in Israel later today? Is this further planning for potential attacks?"

1578,Article 1578,"However, there is room for miscalculation. And I think part of his regional visit is to make sure that everything is under control. Again, the U.S. posture in the region is very strong and I think played a role in deterring Iran."
1579,Article 1579,"MARGARET BRENNAN: In Cairo, you mentioned the diplomacy that is under way. The CIA director, Bill Burns, is there, Brett McGurk, one of the president's top advisers, as well."

1582,Article 1582,"As Secretary Blinken said a few days ago, the U.S. put forward a bridging proposal, which was accepted by Israel, and now it's up to Hamas to say if they accept it or not. So they did send their representative. But we're still not 100 percent sure that they are in the game. We certainly hope so. And, if that is the case, we can make progress towards a deal."
1583,Article 1583,"MARGARET BRENNAN: The secretary of state did say the bridging proposal was accepted. But then your prime minister has said things publicly that seem to contradict that in terms of the specifics, particularly among that Philadelphi Corridor."
1584,Article 1584,What is reality?
1585,Article 1585,AMBASSADOR MICHAEL HERZOG: The reality is that we are not obliged to leave the Philadelphi Corridor at this phase. We are reducing our forces there.
1586,Article 1586,We had constructive talks in Egypt a few days ago. We are well-coordinated with the U.S. administration. We're waiting for Hamas to see if they are in the game.
1587,Article 1587,"MARGARET BRENNAN: When you say in this phase, are you being specific in saying that's not part of phase one of this multiphase diplomatic deal the U.S. is trying to broker?"
1588,Article 1588,"AMBASSADOR MICHAEL HERZOG: The deal is multiphase, as you said, but we are now focusing on phase one."
1589,Article 1589,"And phase one, we hope to get as many live hostages out as possible. It comes with a pause in our military operation for at least 42 days. And, in that period, we hope that, again, we can release as – get out as many live hostages as possible. Every day that passes endangers their lives."

1598,Article 1598,"Well, what I'm concerned about, Margaret, is that those forces will be constrained in what they're able to do in response. I think what we have seen is a reluctance to act like we know what the return address is for this violence."

1609,Article 1609,MARGARET BRENNAN: Hezbollah.
1610,Article 1610,LT. GEN. H.R. MCMASTER (RET.): … who was killed and who the – the – Hezbollah is now trying to launch these attacks in retribution for that.
1611,Article 1611,"I mean, he was responsible in part…"
1612,Article 1612,MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.
1613,Article 1613,"LT. GEN. H.R. MCMASTER (RET.): … for the 1983 bombings that killed 241 Marines, so – in 1983."
1614,Article 1614,MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.
1615,Article 1615,"LT. GEN. H.R. MCMASTER (RET.): So, this has been going on for decades. And I think that the narrative that you constantly hear about turning down the temperature, escalation management…"
1616,Article 1616,MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.
1617,Article 1617,"LT. GEN. H.R. MCMASTER (RET.): … the reluctance really to confront Iran directly and impose costs on Iran, that actually gives Iran license to escalate on their own terms with impunity."
1618,Article 1618,"MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, this is just one of many extremely serious situations that the next commander in chief will be walking into."
1619,Article 1619,It doesn't go away in January.
1620,Article 1620,LT. GEN. H.R. MCMASTER (RET.): Right.
1621,Article 1621,MARGARET BRENNAN: And that's why I want to get to some of what you wrote about in your book. You had this front-row seat. You advised Donald Trump on very sensitive national security matters.
1622,Article 1622,"You write he found it difficult to distinguish – quote – ""between those who brought him sound analysis and those real or imagined who brought him hackneyed bromides. He'd say outlandish things, like go bomb the drugs in Mexico, or why don't we take out the whole North Korean army during one of their parades?"""
1623,Article 1623,"If Trump wins reelection, will he be able to recruit high-quality advisers who can actually help him make sound decisions?"
1624,Article 1624,"LT. GEN. H.R. MCMASTER (RET.): Margaret, I think so, especially in confirmed positions, and if it's a Trump administration."
1625,Article 1625,MARGARET BRENNAN: Because Congress would stop him from putting someone who isn't quality? Is that what you're saying?
1626,Article 1626,"LT. GEN. H.R. MCMASTER (RET.): Well, I think so. You know, I think so, and there are people who are willing to serve who can help do what we tried to do in that first year."
1627,Article 1627,"And the narrative around that first year was all about chaos. But we got a lot done. And, in fact, the story is largely about overcoming that kind of infighting, that war with ourselves…"
1628,Article 1628,MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.
1629,Article 1629,LT. GEN. H.R. MCMASTER (RET.): … to produce policy outcomes that advanced America's interests.
1630,Article 1630,"One of those was a dramatic reversal of the Obama administration Iran policy, which, sadly, the Biden administration has put back into place."
1631,Article 1631,"MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Iran continued with its nuclear development after Trump exited the nuclear deal, against the advice of his secretary of state and his defense secretary."
1632,Article 1632,So…
1633,Article 1633,"LT. GEN. H.R. MCMASTER (RET.): I'm talking more about like the sanctions relief, Margaret…"
1634,Article 1634,MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.
1635,Article 1635,"LT. GEN. H.R. MCMASTER (RET.): … and the degree to which not enforcing the Trump era sanctions had really resulted in about $100 billion transferred to the Iranians, which they have used to intensify their proxy wars in the region, from Iraq to Yemen to Syria to Lebanon and obviously to Gaza with the October 7 attacks."
1636,Article 1636,"MARGARET BRENNAN: You detail specific examples of China's Xi Jinping, Vladimir Putin, even Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu manipulating Donald Trump."
1637,Article 1637,LT. GEN. H.R. MCMASTER (RET.): Right.
1638,Article 1638,MARGARET BRENNAN: And you saw it as it happened.
1639,Article 1639,"You wrote that: ""Trump's lack of historical knowledge made him susceptible to Xi Jinping's efforts to generate sympathy.'"
1640,Article 1640,"So what is the scenario you fear, that, in a second term, Donald Trump pulls U.S. troops out of Asia or that he brokers a transaction to give up Taiwan?"
1641,Article 1641,LT. GEN. H.R. MCMASTER (RET.): Right.
1642,Article 1642,"Well, I write in the book, Margaret, about this dissonance that Donald Trump carries with him, these opposing ideas that sometimes he finds it difficult to reconcile. And that's why I think it's important that he has a competent team around him to help him identify his own agenda."
1643,Article 1643,"I mean, the story in ""At War With Ourselves"" is in large measure my effort to guard his independence of judgment, because, in any administration, there are people who try to manipulate a president into decisions. They don't want to give a president options."
1644,Article 1644,"What my experience was during that first year and a period in which we put into place a lot of these big shifts in policy is, if you give him best analysis, if you give him multiple options, it's in the comparison of those options that he can consider the long-term costs and consequences and make sound decisions."
1645,Article 1645,"Also in the book, though, Margaret, I write about at times he finds it tough to stick with those decisions…"
1646,Article 1646,MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.
1647,Article 1647,"LT. GEN. H.R. MCMASTER (RET.): … because people know kind of how to push his buttons, especially buttons associated with maintaining the complete support of his political base."
1648,Article 1648,MARGARET BRENNAN: Manipulate him.
1649,Article 1649,"You also wrote a specific example where Trump wrote a flattering note to Vladimir Putin in 2018, and it happened to be the same time that this poisoning…"
1650,Article 1650,LT. GEN. H.R. MCMASTER (RET.): Yes.
1651,Article 1651,MARGARET BRENNAN: … had happened on the soil of a U.S. ally by Russia.
1652,Article 1652,LT. GEN. H.R. MCMASTER (RET.): Right.
1653,Article 1653,"MARGARET BRENNAN: When you got home, you said to your wife: ""After a year in this job, I cannot understand Putin's hold on Trump."""
1654,Article 1654,LT. GEN. H.R. MCMASTER (RET.): Yes.
1655,Article 1655,MARGARET BRENNAN: How do you explain that now?
1656,Article 1656,"LT. GEN. H.R. MCMASTER (RET.): Well, I explained it in the book."
1657,Article 1657,"I try to place the president's belief that he could have a good deal with Vladimir Putin in context of the two previous presidents who thought that they could have a good deal with Putin. But, also, President Trump – and people know this – he likes big, splashy deals."
1658,Article 1658,He liked – he was pursuing that with Putin. He was pursuing that with Xi Jinping.
1659,Article 1659,MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.
1660,Article 1660,"LT. GEN. H.R. MCMASTER (RET.): And, of course, Putin is the best liar in the world."
1661,Article 1661,"And so I struggled, Margaret, should I write about how Putin tried to manipulate President Trump or not? And I thought, well, Putin knows how he was trying to do it, so maybe, in writing about how Putin was trying to press Donald Trump's buttons, that will make a future President Trump, if he's elected, less susceptible to those kind of tactics."
1662,Article 1662,"MARGARET BRENNAN: Because he, on the campaign trail, argues these counterfactuals, that Putin was afraid of him, that Putin wouldn't have invaded Ukraine if he had been president."
1663,Article 1663,"LT. GEN. H.R. MCMASTER (RET.): Well, he has a point in a couple of areas."
1664,Article 1664,"In that first year of the Trump administration, I tell the story of how we imposed more sanctions on Russian entities in that one year than the previous eight years of the Obama administration."
1665,Article 1665,MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.
1666,Article 1666,"LT. GEN. H.R. MCMASTER (RET.): And the really critical decision, though, Margaret, I think, was to provide the Ukrainians with defensive capabilities, especially in the form of Javelin missiles."
1667,Article 1667,MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.
1668,Article 1668,"LT. GEN. H.R. MCMASTER (RET.): But in the area of inconsistency, I also tell the story about how that support was suspended to get evidence of the Biden family's corrupt activities in Ukraine."
1669,Article 1669,MARGARET BRENNAN: The grounds for impeachment…
1670,Article 1670,"LT. GEN. H.R. MCMASTER (RET.): Right, absolutely."
1671,Article 1671,MARGARET BRENNAN: … which basically you're saying were justified.
1672,Article 1672,LT. GEN. H.R. MCMASTER (RET.): Right. So there is…
1673,Article 1673,MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.
1674,Article 1674,LT. GEN. H.R. MCMASTER (RET.): There's an element in the story about how he can make really sound decisions and disrupt things that need to be disrupted in terms of foreign policy and national security…
1675,Article 1675,MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.
1676,Article 1676,LT. GEN. H.R. MCMASTER (RET.): … but oftentimes struggles to hang on to those decisions and see them through.
1677,Article 1677,"MARGARET BRENNAN: H.R. McMaster, thank you. It's an interesting read."
1678,Article 1678,"LT. GEN. H.R. MCMASTER (RET.): Thanks, Margaret. Thank you, Margaret."
1679,Article 1679,MARGARET BRENNAN: We will be right back.
1680,Article 1680,(ANNOUNCEMENTS)
1681,Article 1681,MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to Pennsylvania Democratic Congresswoman Summer Lee. She joins us from Pittsburgh.
1682,Article 1682,"Good morning to you, Congresswoman."
1683,Article 1683,REPRESENTATIVE SUMMER LEE (D-Pennsylvania): Good morning.
1684,Article 1684,"MARGARET BRENNAN: Our CBS polling shows that a majority of Americans, 59 percent of them, think the U.S. should encourage Israel to stop or decrease its military actions in Gaza."
1685,Article 1685,At the Democratic Convention. Vice President Harris received loud applause for these remarks:
1686,Article 1686,(Begin VT)
1687,Article 1687,"KAMALA HARRIS (Vice President of the United States (D) and U.S. Presidential Candidate): President Biden and I are working to end this war such that Israel is secure, the hostages are released, the suffering in Gaza ends, and the Palestinian people can realize their right to dignity, security, freedom and self-determination."
1688,Article 1688,(CHEERING)
1689,Article 1689,(APPLAUSE)
1690,Article 1690,(End VT)
1691,Article 1691,MARGARET BRENNAN: Now that is largely just restating existing U.S. policy.
1692,Article 1692,Do you think that's sufficient outreach to those who felt the administration hasn't expressed empathy?
1693,Article 1693,"REPRESENTATIVE SUMMER LEE: You know, I think that – you know, I think people who are experiencing this, right, who are – who are outside of the arena, who have been organizing since October, you know, that is a step."
1694,Article 1694,"But I think that what they really were asking for was a – of course, the opportunity to speak for themselves. I think that, like all people, when you are experiencing something, you want to be able to tell your own story. And a lot of the people who are Palestinian, Palestinian-American, Arabs and Muslims were asking for that opportunity."
1695,Article 1695,"So while, you know, we all obviously believe that there should be a cease- fire immediately and permanently, and that Palestinians, just like Israelis, deserve the right to self-determination, we have to do more than just say that we believe that. We have to actually take steps that are going to evidence that, take steps that are going to show that we're willing to start to listen to people who have been outside of the political, I would say, conversation for so long."
1696,Article 1696,"It's been a third rail. And there's going to be a lot more work that we have to do to show to this demographic that the Democratic Party is – includes them in its big tent, includes them in our foreign policy considerations, and also includes them in our conversations around humanity and human rights."
1697,Article 1697,MARGARET BRENNAN: You're talking about the decision at the DNC to deny anyone from the Uncommitted Movement or Palestinian-American to take the stage.
1698,Article 1698,"Congressman Ro Khanna tweeted: ""It was a tragic mistake, perpetuating the erasure of the Palestinian story and voice."""
1699,Article 1699,"Why do you think Democratic leaders resisted it, and is it a self-inflicted wound?"
1700,Article 1700,"REPRESENTATIVE SUMMER LEE: I think that there has been – and I think that, if you really look at this, long before October 7, it was almost taboo to talk about Palestinians, to talk about the experiences that they have and that they continue to have in our politics."
1701,Article 1701,"And I think that this was a continuation of it. To put on stage – first of all, I think it's important that we recognize that even the way we talk about the movement is in a way that sometimes is a little wide – it's broad."
1702,Article 1702,MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.
1703,Article 1703,REPRESENTATIVE SUMMER LEE: It doesn't always take into account what folks are arguing about.
1704,Article 1704,"I think that, whether it's the Black lives movement or the movement for Palestinian rights, there's always this rush to say that their movement, the ways that they protest, the tactics, the strategies are inconvenient. And I think that that's just the way that we've done it, especially when we're nervous about a presidential election that we all know is incredibly important."
1705,Article 1705,"Defeating Trump is the top concern, but we can do that, and we can also give space, create space for people, voices that are marginalized. We missed an opportunity to do that here. And in doing so, what we are essentially saying is that every Palestinian thinks the exact same way, that all folks who are protesting who are voicing their concerns are one group, and not individuals, not all folks who are coming with different perspectives."
1706,Article 1706,I think that there was room and space to say that…
1707,Article 1707,MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.
1708,Article 1708,REPRESENTATIVE SUMMER LEE: … there is room in the Democratic Party for that particular perspective as well.
1709,Article 1709,"MARGARET BRENNAN: This was a historic nomination of Vice President Harris as the first black, first South Asian nominee of a major party."
1710,Article 1710,She's chosen really not to talk about the historic nature of that. Do you think that she should?
1711,Article 1711,REPRESENTATIVE SUMMER LEE: I think that it speaks for itself.
1712,Article 1712,"You know, I think that there is, you know, zero chance that folks all across America do not recognize that she would be the first Black woman, the first South Asian woman in person, to be not just our party's nominee, but hopefully our president."
1713,Article 1713,"So, to talk about it, it's almost a filler. I think that what's – I think that what they're doing and what they should be doing is talking about the issues…"
1714,Article 1714,MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.
1715,Article 1715,REPRESENTATIVE SUMMER LEE: … talking about the things that not…
1716,Article 1716,MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.
1717,Article 1717,"REPRESENTATIVE SUMMER LEE: … are not just unique to women, black women, Asian women…"
1718,Article 1718,MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.
1719,Article 1719,REPRESENTATIVE SUMMER LEE: … but actually the things that make her qualified for the job…
1720,Article 1720,MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.
1721,Article 1721,"REPRESENTATIVE SUMMER LEE: … her – her resume, the policies that that bring Democrats to – to vote…"
1722,Article 1722,"MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes, let's – let's talk about those things…"
1723,Article 1723,"REPRESENTATIVE SUMMER LEE: … you know, on November 5. Those are things that we're going to need to focus on. We all know there's history here."
1724,Article 1724,"MARGARET BRENNAN: Congresswoman, let's talk about those things on the other side of this next break."
1725,Article 1725,Stay with us.
1726,Article 1726,(ANNOUNCEMENTS)
1727,Article 1727,"MARGARET BRENNAN: Just ahead, we talk to former FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb, as well as New York Congressman Pat Ryan, and Oklahoma Republican Governor Kevin Stitt."
1728,Article 1728,"So, stay with us."
1729,Article 1729,(ANNOUNCEMENTS)
1730,Article 1730,MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION.
1731,Article 1731,We're continuing our conversation now with Congresswoman Summer Lee of Pennsylvania.
1732,Article 1732,"Congresswoman, you were talking before the break about the need to focus on issues for - for the campaign. This past week former Speaker Pelosi stated Vice President Harris will, quote, ""have to govern from the center because that's where the public is."""
1733,Article 1733,"I know you are a progressive Democrat. Do you think that this pivot to the center, particularly on issues like the border and immigration and crime, are they going to hurt support for the Harris-Walz ticket or is it - what's required?"
1734,Article 1734,"REPRESENTATIVE SUMMER LEE (D-PA): Yes. So, I have to say, and I - and I like to hope that we're able to do this. I have to - I have to disagree a bit. I think that we have data, we have polling, we have anecdotal evidence from American – Americans all over the country, but especially out in Pennsylvania, in a swing state, where we're not actually asking for our - our candidates to run away from progressive ideals. We're asking them for - for them to run to them."
1735,Article 1735,"You know, there's this idea that to say that, you know, having health care or an equitable education or even talking about, you know, immigration reform and the border in a humane way is somehow to the left. But I think that that's what the average American wants. And I think that in too many - in very many ways we've ceded ground to Republicans, especially around immigration. They have the tendency of talking about it in incredibly fear mongering and inhumane way. And I don't think that it's wise that we join them in that. I think people want to see us distinguish ourselves as a party. I think they want to see that we offer solutions for working class people, for marginalized people. And I think that we can do that vocally and proudly and still bring people to the party and not have them run away from it."
1736,Article 1736,"MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. So, that means you disagree with the Harris endorsement of the bipartisan border bill, which was a fairly conservative bill, and that's the policy stated for what the vice president would enact if she's elected?"
1737,Article 1737,"REPRESENTATIVE SUMMER LEE: I think that what I'd like to hope - I hope that - what I think so many of us want to see, and not just progressives, I mean even just Democrats, is that we can recognize that we need comprehensive immigration reform. That there are millions of folks in America who are impacted by this. Folks who want to come here for a better life. Who are looking for opportunities. And they are finding that the pathway, the window to achieving those opportunities is shutting, not opening."
1738,Article 1738,"We know that in the past there were systems in place that - that created a - an easier pathway for folks to obtain citizenship, for folks to work, for folks to contribute. And that's what people want now. And I think that we need to be real about the solutions, what's driving folks to our border."
1739,Article 1739,MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.
1740,Article 1740,REPRESENTATIVE SUMMER LEE: And what's driving folks to want to make a life here in the United States at the same time.
1741,Article 1741,"MARGARET BRENNAN: All right, Congresswoman Lee, thank you for your perspective."
1742,Article 1742,"For a slightly different one from a fellow Democrat, we are joined now by New York Congressman Pat Ryan."
1743,Article 1743,Good morning.
1744,Article 1744,"REPRESENTATIVE PAT RYAN (D-NY): Hey, how are you doing, Margaret?"
1745,Article 1745,MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm doing well.
1746,Article 1746,"You know, you were at the DNC this week speaking on stage. You were one of the very first House Democrats to call out and publicly say Joe Biden needed to pass the torch."
1747,Article 1747,"You're in a tight re-election race in - in Hudson Valley, New York. Do you think that having Kamala Harris at the top of the ticket makes it easier for you to win than if Joe Biden had stayed?"
1748,Article 1748,"REPRESENTATIVE PAT RYAN: Without question. I mean, coming out of the DNC, and - and for the last now month plus we have just seen such energy, such enthusiasm, such true joy and optimism at a time when even, this morning in your coverage, it's a challenging, dark and divided time. And that's what people in my district are - are desperate for. That - that is what we've been working on."
1749,Article 1749,"When Kamala Harris talks about freedom, patriotism, reproductive freedom, economic freedom, freedom to breathe clean air and water, that is what folks, regardless of party, they want to believe in something, to be for something. And she has delivered that. And I think over the next 72 days we're going to see that momentum continue to build."
1750,Article 1750,MARGARET BRENNAN: The former speaker points to five seats in New York state as determining the difference between Democrats having a minority or majority spot in Congress. You are one of those seats. Do you think that now Democrats have a better shot at gaining the majority?
1751,Article 1751,"REPRESENTATIVE PAT RYAN: Yes, no doubt."
1752,Article 1752,MARGARET BRENNAN: Definitely?
1753,Article 1753,"REPRESENTATIVE PAT RYAN: No doubt. It's just been a sea change. I mean, I won my last race by 1.3 percent."
1754,Article 1754,MARGARET BRENNAN: Exactly.
1755,Article 1755,"REPRESENTATIVE PAT RYAN: Very attune to what's happening in my district and talking to folks all day, every day. It has been just kind of putting rocket fuel into a jet engine and seeing blast off. It's such - it's so important, I think, to understand, it's one thing to be against a set of things -"
1756,Article 1756,MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.
1757,Article 1757,"REPRESENTATIVE PAT RYAN: But - but to be for a set of things and a set - and for core freedoms, that is - that's rallying people."
1758,Article 1758,"MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, so then let's put this in specific terms because some of the policies aren't that different from Joe Biden's policies. In fact, they're exactly the same on - on the border. And you, when you issued that statement calling for Biden to step aside, you called for him to restore order at the border. Your district has been hit with a lot of migrants being sent from New York City up to the Hudson Valley. What is any different about the Harris platform on the border?"
1759,Article 1759,"REPRESENTATIVE PAT RYAN: I served 27 months in combat. I know what it means to secure a border. And I think foundational to the responsibilities of a nation state is to secure the border. That - that's not a partisan thing, that's a widely held view. So, I - I did, you know, call on and sort of call out President Biden in not doing enough. They've - they've - they've -"
1760,Article 1760,MARGARET BRENNAN: But that was the Biden-Harris policy.
1761,Article 1761,"REPRESENTATIVE PAT RYAN: They've stepped up. And wat we heard from Vice President Harris at the convention, in her speech, was exactly what folks in my district want to hear, which is, we're going to secure the border, restore order at the border, but not lose who we are as Americans to welcome folks that want to come here, make a better life, serve our country, make it better and stronger. We can do both. We will do both."
1762,Article 1762,"MARGARET BRENNAN: So, but it's still not articulated as a different policy in the specifics. We haven't heard the vice president at least say things in detail."
1763,Article 1763,"But on the issue of abortion, which is already protected in New York state up to 24 weeks, after that point it has to be that the mother's life is at risk for that procedure to be taken, but it's going to be on the ballot in some form or fashion in November. Do you think that this is just about driving up turnout?"
1764,Article 1764,REPRESENTATIVE PAT RYAN: The whole founding -
1765,Article 1765,MARGARET BRENNAN: It's already protected (INAUDIBLE).
1766,Article 1766,REPRESENTATIVE PAT RYAN: The whole founding ideology of our country is about freedom. People don't forget that just two years ago the - Trump's appointees to the Supreme Court ripped away a fundamental freedom. There have been more states across the country now taking away American freedoms.
1767,Article 1767,"You want to piss off the American people, take their freedom away."
1768,Article 1768,And so this is - this is not like a political thing again. This gets to the core of who we are.
1769,Article 1769,"And so in New York, things like the Comstock Act that are on the books, outlined in Project 2025, even without congressional action, the Trump - hypothetical Trump administration says they can put in place essentially a backdoor national abortion ban. We are stand ug up against that, as Democrats, really as Americans though. And that will be a huge issue in my district."
1770,Article 1770,MARGARET BRENNAN: Trump and Vance haven't been very clear on the Comstock Act. I asked vice - I asked J.D. Vance a lot of questions about it just a few weeks ago.
1771,Article 1771,"Just to put that aside, though, I want to ask you about Afghanistan, because in your - in your call for Joe Biden to step aside, you also pointed to that as a Biden-Harris problem. In fact, you said it was a strategic and a moral failure, that withdraw. The vice president says she was that last person in the room on that decision. Is that failure also hers?"
1772,Article 1772,REPRESENTATIVE PAT RYAN: We've got to stop assigning partisan blame on fundamental things like our national security.
1773,Article 1773,MARGARET BRENNAN: You said that.
1774,Article 1774,"REPRESENTATIVE PAT RYAN: I - I said it as an American. I said it as someone who served in combat, who had friends that served in Afghanistan. If we can't make mistakes and - and wrestle with that, with a little bit of space to do better in the future, how do we expect to continue on the next 250 years as this great country that we are?"
1775,Article 1775,"So, we have to be - and I've called on presidents of both parties when I disagree with them, on behalf of my constituents, on behalf of what I think is right for the country. So, we have to be able to do that."
1776,Article 1776,MARGARET BRENNAN: I bring that up because we are coming up on the three- year anniversary of that withdraw and that fatal attack at Abbey Gate where 13 service people lost their lives in the ISIS-k suicide bombing. The family members of some of those service people took the stage at the RNC and said that President Biden hasn't spoken their names and how hurtful that was to them.
1777,Article 1777,Do you think the vice president should speak to that now this week?
1778,Article 1778,"REPRESENTATIVE PAT RYAN: Well, I'll let the vice president make her decisions about things like that. What I do think we need to recognize is, you want to talk about how we're speaking to veterans and military families. Just ten days ago Donald Trump got up and said, Medal of Honor recipients, the most revered hero's in our country's history, there's only 62 living Medal of Honor recipients in the United States, he directly denigrated and insulted them, on top of years of insulting gold star families, calling our troops suckers and losers. That's something I spoke about at the convention."
1779,Article 1779,"And I believe we're in a place where the Democratic Party is a party of patriots. Folks voting for Kamala Harris can feel that they are doing - and I certainly feel - their patriotic duty to bring our country together, stop insulting veterans and military families that have made the ultimate sacrifice. And Kamala Harris has done that and - and will continue to do that."
1780,Article 1780,MARGARET BRENNAN: But it would mean something to those in your district if that loss was acknowledged this week?
1781,Article 1781,"REPRESENTATIVE PAT RYAN: Wel, I think that it would mean a lot to the family members, of course, to acknowledge their - their loss."
1782,Article 1782,MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.
1783,Article 1783,"REPRESENTATIVE PAT RYAN: And, you know, we've lost far too many veterans, not just in active duty combat -"
1784,Article 1784,MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.
1785,Article 1785,"REPRESENTATIVE PAT RYAN: But we've talked about this before, coming home. We've now lost more Iraq and Afghanistan veterans to suicide than we lost in active duty."
1786,Article 1786,MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.
1787,Article 1787,"REPRESENTATIVE PAT RYAN: So, we need to properly fund the VA. Another thing that Donald Trump failed to do."
1788,Article 1788,MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.
1789,Article 1789,"REPRESENTATIVE PAT RYAN: And so it's a - these are important, stark choices ahead."
1790,Article 1790,"MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman - Congressman, good to have you here."
1791,Article 1791,"REPRESENTATIVE PAT RYAN: Thanks, Margaret."
1792,Article 1792,MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back.
1793,Article 1793,(ANNOUNCEMENTS)
1794,Article 1794,MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to Republican Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt from Oklahoma City.
1795,Article 1795,"Good morning to you, Governor."
1796,Article 1796,"GOVERNOR KEVIN STITT (R-OK): Hey, good morning. Good to be with you."
1797,Article 1797,"MARGARET BRENNAN: So, one of the biggest drivers of inflation right now are shelter costs. And I know in a previous life you founded a mortgage business. So, I want to tap in to something that's also a problem in Oklahoma, and that is the housing shortage."
1798,Article 1798,Donald Trump was asked earlier this week when he was out campaigning in Nevada his plan. And he said he would like to release more federal lands to allow homes to be built.
1799,Article 1799,Is that sufficient?
1800,Article 1800,"GOVERNOR KEVIN STITT: Well, first off, thanks for - thanks for having me on."
1801,Article 1801,"You know, I'll tell you this, as a businessman before I became governor, I was in the mortgage business. And the last thing that you want to do is the Kamala - the Vice President Harris plan, which is to put $25,000 more into every single person's pocket for the purpose of buying houses, because if you increase demand without fixing this -"
1802,Article 1802,MARGARET BRENNAN: But for first-time home owners.
1803,Article 1803,"GOVERNOR KEVIN STITT: For first-time home buyers, that's correct. But if you throw the demand side up without fixing supply, what happens to pricing? You're actually exasperating the problem. Prices for housing goes up."
1804,Article 1804,"So, the solution that President Trump's talking about, and it's the correct solution, is to eliminate permitting reform, get permitting reform, make it easier for developers, make it easier for people to develop and build houses, get rid of regulations. That's the - that's the free market principles that we believe in. And we know are the correct way to do it."
1805,Article 1805,I mean if - when you think about it -
1806,Article 1806,MARGARET BRENNAN: Well -
1807,Article 1807,GOVERNOR KEVIN STITT: Listen – go ahead.
1808,Article 1808,"MARGARET BRENNAN: Sorry. The vice president said she also wants to create 3 million homes. So, she is talking about adding to supply. But on the Republican Party platform, because we went to look at it, it says that Republicans will reduce mortgage rates by slashing inflation - that's really a Fed decision, right - but also open portions of federal lands to allow for new home construction. Sounds very much the same as the Harris plan. And then promote home ownership through tax incentives and support for first-time buyers. Also sounds very similar to the Harris plan. So, what's different?"
1809,Article 1809,"GOVERNOR KEVIN STITT: Well, first off, there are so many first-time home buyer programs right now. And my question to you - and this is a great question for Vice President Harris - who's going to build the 3 million homes?"
1810,Article 1810,MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.
1811,Article 1811,"GOVERNOR KEVIN STITT: I mean, basically, we believe either in a free market system or we believe in government intervention. And so the bottom line is, you're going to drive up the cost - the reason we have 20 percent inflation under a Biden-Harris administration right now is because of all of the attacks on energy, for example, the bureaucracy. We need permitting reform. We need deregulation. We need to unlock American businesses to meet the needs of Americans."
1812,Article 1812,"Basically, when you have municipalities stopping new developments for lot sizes and for first-time home buyers, that's the things you need to do. By increasing and throwing more money and giving - like, think about it for a second. This ticket - and I know Governor Walz. I'm friends with him in the National Governors Association. He's a nice guy. I've met - I've met Vice President Harris a couple times. She seems like a nice person."
1813,Article 1813,"But if you think about the Democratic ticket, they've never worked in the private sector. They've - and so their policies are showing that. You can't give every single first-time home buyer $25,000 and expect the prices of houses to come down. That's just not the way the economy works. That's -"
1814,Article 1814,MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.
1815,Article 1815,GOVERNOR KEVIN STITT: That's socialism. That's - that's communism.
1816,Article 1816,"MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, yes. It's not clear what the Republican platform means when they say tax incentives and support for first-time buyers. So, it's not - it's not clear to - how - what their detailed option is when they say also helping those first-time buyers."
1817,Article 1817,"But on the economy, your state has a law that prohibits an increase of more than 10 percent for the price of goods and services during emergencies. The Harris campaign wants federal restrictions on those kind of price jumps. Why do you oppose it at the federal level if you have something at the state level?"
1818,Article 1818,"GOVERNOR KEVIN STITT: Well, what we're talking about on the state level, if we have a natural disaster. For example, if there's a tornado that comes through our of our communities, we don't want out-of-state people coming in and price gouging as far as roofing, materials. So, when I declare a national - an executive order and say this area of the state has been hurt, it's for a short period of time. It's maybe for a month. And that's just to protect the people from really people coming in to - to - to try to make money off of this disaster. So, that's totally different than what I see this administration, the Vice President Harris, recommending. So, she's saying - here's - here's the problem that doesn't make sense to the American people, and you need to question her on this. OK, so she's going to tell grocery stores that the maximum you can pay -"
1819,Article 1819,MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.
1820,Article 1820,"GOVERNOR KEVIN STITT: For milk and charge for milk is $1.99. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. Well, they're saying they're not doing that."
1821,Article 1821,"GOVERNOR KEVIN STITT: Well, what happens to the famers if the costs are more than that?"
1822,Article 1822,MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.
1823,Article 1823,"GOVERNOR KEVIN STITT: OK, what are they saying they're doing?"
1824,Article 1824,"MARGARET BRENNAN: I would love to put those questions, but -"
1825,Article 1825,GOVERNOR KEVIN STITT: What's price control then?
1826,Article 1826,"MARGARET BRENNAN: I got you for - for a question. You are backing President Trump. Early on you had supported the governor of Florida, Ron DeSantis. And he had warned Republicans about this."
1827,Article 1827,(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
1828,Article 1828,GOVERNOR RON DESANTIS (R-FL): You're not going to be talking about the border. You're not going to be talking about the economy. You're going to be talking about all these things to make the election a referendum on Donald Trump.
1829,Article 1829,"Whereas, if I'm the nominee, we'll be solely focused on the issues that matter to the American people."
1830,Article 1830,(END VIDEO CLIP)
1831,Article 1831,MARGARET BRENNAN: Is President Trump getting in his own way on his own messaging?
1832,Article 1832,"GOVERNOR KEVIN STITT: You know, I'm not going to defend what Vice President Harris said in the convention against President Trump or what President Trump is saying. This is - this is not about winning an argument. And I - and I think the American people are really tired of that."
1833,Article 1833,Let's - we have to get back to asking questions about policy.
1834,Article 1834,MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.
1835,Article 1835,"GOVERNOR KEVIN STITT: And Vice President Harris' policies have led to 20 percent increase in inflation. And I think the American people, at the end of the day -"
1836,Article 1836,MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.
1837,Article 1837,"GOVERNOR KEVIN STITT: When they ask themselves, were they better off -"
1838,Article 1838,MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.
1839,Article 1839,GOVERNOR KEVIN STITT: When President Trump was in office? The answer is going to be yes.
1840,Article 1840,MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.

1844,Article 1844,(ANNOUNCEMENTS)
1845,Article 1845,"MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're joined by former FDA Commissioner, and Pfizer board member, Dr. Scott Gottlieb."
1846,Article 1846,Good to have you here.
1847,Article 1847,SCOTT GOTTLIEB (former FDA Commissioner): Good morning.
1848,Article 1848,"MARGARET BRENNAN: So, this is a Covid summer surge. The CDC says we may be at the peak or about to pass it now."
1849,Article 1849,The Biden administration has just made free testing available that will come at the end of the month. The new booster shot was just approved. Is this just playing catch up here?
1850,Article 1850,SCOTT GOTTLIEB: I don't think so. I think the timing's about right in terms of rolling out the vaccine and the tests that will be available for people in the winter time.
1851,Article 1851,"Look, we've had these summer surges and then a subsequent winter surge now a couple of seasons in a row. So, I think we need to start to understand, this is probably the predictable pattern for this virus for the foreseeable future."
1852,Article 1852,"It's going to be hard to have a vaccine available earlier than they have had it this year. They've got the vaccine out earlier than they have in the past, in part to try to time it with the flu vaccine, so that when people go into the pharmacy, they can get both a Covid vaccine and a flu vaccine, which I think is going to be important for a lot of older Americans."
1853,Article 1853,"It is the case that we do see these summer surges, and we will have to think about how we protect people better in the future. I think the idea of having a dual vaccine, having two vaccines per year, that may be a difficult thing just from a manufacturing and a production standpoint."
1854,Article 1854,"MARGARET BRENNAN: So, this booster is about KP.2 variant."
1855,Article 1855,SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Right.
1856,Article 1856,MARGARET BRENNAN: KP.3 is what is swirling around now apparently. It will still protect you?
1857,Article 1857,"SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Yes, so the data right now, it's pre-clinical data. So, it's data looking at whether or not the antibodies that are produced as a result of getting vaccinated from KP.2 will also neutralize this KP.3 strain. That data looks encouraging. And we rely on that data. That neutralizing antibody days. We've historically relied on it. And it's been a good proxy for how effective the vaccine is going to be."
1858,Article 1858,"So, this vaccine should protect against KP.3. About a third of the cases of KP.3 right now. I don't believe that the winter surge, and we're likely to see a winter surge of Covid, is going to be from KP.3. Right now, if you look across the country, Covid cases are starting to decline in most parts of the country. Perhaps the northeast is still rising, parts of the west. States like Utah and Colorado. But we should be through most of this summer surge. Cases should start to continue to come down. And in what ultimately emerges in the wintertime, we don't know yet."
1859,Article 1859,"MARGARET BRENNAN: So, when do you get it? The vaccine, that is. And the guidance from the CDC is, once your fever breaks, count five days and you're good to go. That's not necessarily going to stop transmission, is it?"
1860,Article 1860,"SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Yes, look, I think people who get Covid and recover from Covid, probably should use an antigen test to see when they're no longer infectious. If you're still registering on an antigen test, you're likely still shedding some virus, although your infectivity probably has come down a lot when you're five, six days out."
1861,Article 1861,"I think for Americans who are going into settings where there's people who are at risk, where they work in confined spaces, where people may be vulnerable, they may need to take some added precautions if they're recovering from an infection and still testing positive on the antigen test. There's no really, you know, golden rule in terms of when people aren't infective anymore. If you want to be vigilant, use an antigen test to look for that."
1862,Article 1862,"In terms of when to get the vaccine, for most Americans getting it sometime in September, or maybe early October is going to be sufficient to try to protect them from that winter surge. I think a lot of Americans were worried about the current surge and there's still a lot of virus around, could go out and get the vaccine right now because they could still catch Covid from this current wave of infection."
1863,Article 1863,"For people who have been infected, they likely have several months of good protection from that recent infection. So, they may want to wait a little bit longer, that way when they do get vaccinated, maybe late October, that vaccine will extend further. Because we know that the immunity provided by the vaccines only lasts a defined period of time, three, four, five months."
1864,Article 1864,"MARGARET BRENNAN: And it's - it's a serious strain, I'll - I'll - I'll say that. The CDC said that they saw a high number of children under five going to the ER. Why are kids being impacted like that?"
1865,Article 1865,"SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Well, part of that is that kids don't have baseline immunity. So, a lot of adults have baseline immunity. So, when you look at the statistics on who's going to the emergency room, overall, about 2.4 percent of all emergency room visits are for Covid right now. But for the cohort over the age of 65, that's about 3.4 percent. So, 3.4 percent of all people over the age of 65 who go to the emergency room for any reason are going there for Covid."
1866,Article 1866,"In children under the age of five, it's 5.8 percent. So, a higher proportion of kids who go to the emergency room are going to the emergency room for Covid. They're getting sick because they don't have baseline immunity. They haven't been infected before. They haven't been vaccinated."
1867,Article 1867,"I think part of it's also that parents are more likely to take a sick child to the emergency room than take themselves to the emergency room. So, that's some of what's baked into that."
1868,Article 1868,MARGARET BRENNAN: It's hard to get a kid vaccinated though.
1869,Article 1869,SCOTT GOTTLIEB: It's hard to -
1870,Article 1870,MARGARET BRENNAN: To find a -
1871,Article 1871,SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Find a place that vaccinates toddlers.
1872,Article 1872,"So, I - if you think of CVS, for example, most of their pharmacies won't vaccinate toddlers. It's only the pharmacies that have mini (ph) clinics. A lot of pediatricians don't stock the under five vaccine because a lot of parents aren't asking for it. If your pediatrician doesn't have the vaccine, and you want to vaccinate your child, you can ask them to order it and it should be available within 24 to 48 hours."
1873,Article 1873,"MARGARET BRENNAN: All right, Dr. Gottlieb, I have so many more questions for you but we have to leave it there for right now."
1874,Article 1874,SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Thanks a lot.
1875,Article 1875,MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back.

1922,Article 1922,"MARGARET BRENNAN: Now that is largely just restating existing U.S. policy. Do you think that's sufficient outreach to those who felt the administration hasn't expressed empathy,"
1923,Article 1923,"REP. LEE: You know, I think that, you know, I think people who are experiencing this, right, who were- who were outside of the arena, who have been organizing since October, you know, that is a step, but I think that what they really were asking for was a, of course, the opportunity to speak for themselves. I think that, like all people, when you are experiencing something, you want to be able to tell your own story. And a lot of the people who are Palestinian, Palestinian-American, Arabs and Muslims, were asking for that opportunity. So while, you know, we all obviously believe that there should be a ceasefire immediately and permanently, and that Palestinians, just like Israelis, deserve the right to self-determination. We have to do more than just say that we believe that. We have to actually take steps that are going to evidence that take steps that are going to show that we're willing to start to listen to people who have been outside of the political, I would say, conversation for so long, it's been a third rail, and there's going to be a lot more work that we have to do to show to this demographic that the Democratic Party is- includes them in its big tent, includes them in our foreign policy considerations, and also includes them in our conversations around humanity and human rights."
1924,Article 1924,"MARGARET BRENNAN: You're talking about the decision at the DNC to deny anyone from the Uncommitted Movement or Palestinian-American to take the stage. Congressman Ro Khanna tweeted, ""it was a tragic mistake perpetuating the erasure of the Palestinian story and voice."" Why do you think Democratic leaders resisted it, and is it a self-inflicted wound?"
1925,Article 1925,"REP. LEE: I think that there has been, and I think that if you really look at this, long before October 7, it was almost taboo to talk about Palestinians, to talk about the experiences that they have and that they continue to have in our politics. And I think that this was a continuation of it. To put on stage, first of all, I think it's important that we recognize that even the way we talk about the movement is in a way that sometimes is a little wide, it's broad. It doesn't always take into account what folks are arguing about. I think that whether it's the Black lives movement or the movement for Palestinian rights, there's always this rush to say that their movement, the ways that they protest, the tactics, the strategies, are inconvenient, and I think that that's just the way that we've done it. Especially when we're nervous about a presidential election that we all know is incredibly important. Defeating Trump is the top concern, but we can do that, and we can also give space, create space for people, voices that are marginalized. We missed an opportunity to do that here, and in doing so, what we are essentially saying is that every Palestinian thinks the exact same way, that all folks who are protesting, who are voicing their concerns are one group and not individuals, not all folks who are coming with different perspectives. I think that there was room and space to say that. There was room in the Democratic Party for that particular perspective as well."
1926,Article 1926,"MARGARET BRENNAN: This was a historic nomination of Vice President Harris as the first Black, first South Asian nominee of a major party. She's chosen, really, not to talk about the historic nature of that. Do you think that she should?"
1927,Article 1927,"REP. LEE: I think that it speaks for itself. You know, I think that there is, you know, zero chance that folks all across America do not recognize that she would be the first Black woman, the first South Asian woman in person, to be not just our party's nominee, but hopefully our president. So to talk about it, it's almost a filler. I think that what's- I think that what they're doing and what they should be doing is talking about the issues. Talking about the things that not are not just unique to women, Black women, Asian women, but actually the things that make her qualified for the job, her resume, the policies that that bring Democrats to- to vote, you know on November 5, those are the things we need to focus on, we all know there's history here."
1928,Article 1928,"MARGARET BRENNAN: Congresswoman, let's talk about those things on the other side of this next break, stay with us."
1929,Article 1929,– COMMERCIAL BREAK –
1930,Article 1930,"MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to Face The Nation. We're continuing our conversation now with Congresswoman Summer Lee of Pennsylvania. Congresswoman, you were talking before the break about the need to focus on issues for- for the campaign. This past week, former Speaker Pelosi stated Vice President Harris will, quote, ""have to"" govern from the center, because ""that's where the public is."" I know you are a progressive Democrat. Do you think that this pivot to the center, particularly on issues like the border and immigration and crime, are they going to hurt support for the Harris-Walz ticket, or is it what's required?"
1931,Article 1931,"REP. LEE: Yeah, so I have to say, and I like to hope that we're able to do this. I have to- I have to disagree a bit. I think that we have data, we have polling, we have anecdotal evidence from American- Americans all over the country, but especially out in Pennsylvania, in a swing state where we're not actually asking for our candidates to run away from progressive ideals. We're asking them- for them to run to them. You know, there's this idea that to say that, you know, having health care or equitable education, or even talking about, you know, immigration reform and the border in a humane way is somehow to the left, but I think that that's what the average American wants. And I think that in too many, in very many ways, we've ceded ground to Republicans, especially around immigration. They have the tendency of talking about it in an incredibly fear mongering and inhumane way. And I don't think that it's wise that we join them in that. I think people want to see us distinguish ourselves as a party. I think they want to see that we offer solutions for working class people, for marginalized people, and I think that we can do that vocally and proudly and still bring people to the party and not have them run away from it."
1932,Article 1932,"MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, so that means you disagree with the Harris endorsement of the bipartisan border bill, which was a fairly conservative bill, and that's the policy stated for what the Vice President would enact if she's elected."
1933,Article 1933,"REP. LEE: I think that what I like to hope- I hope that what I think so many of us want to see, and not just progressives, I mean, even just Democrats, is that we can recognize that we need comprehensive immigration reform. That there are millions of folks in America who are impacted by this, folks who want to come here for a better life, who are looking for opportunities, and they are finding that the pathway, the window to achieving those opportunities, is shutting, not opening. We know that in the past, there were systems in place that- that created an easier pathway for folks who attain citizenship, for folks to work, for folks to contribute, and that's what people want now. And I think that we need to be real about the solutions. What's driving folks to our border and what's driving folks to want to make a life here in the United States at the same time."
1934,Article 1934,"MARGARET BRENNAN: All right, Congresswoman Lee, thank you for your perspective."

1941,Article 1941,ByDavid Morgan
1942,Article 1942,"Updated on:  August 19, 2024 / 1:29 PM EDT/ CBS News"
1943,Article 1943,"A look back at the esteemed personalities who left us this year, who'd touched us with their innovation, creativity and humanity."
1944,Article 1944,By CBSNews.com senior producer David Morgan. The Associated Press contributed to this gallery.
1945,Article 1945,"BroadcasterPhil Donahue(December 21, 1935-August 18, 2024) pioneered the modern daytime talk show by incorporating audience participation, with guests as varied as Hollywood celebrities and white supremacists, who were questioned by members of the audience and live phone callers."
1946,Article 1946,"The format of ""The Phil Donahue Show"" set it apart from other daytime shows. Begun in Dayton, Ohio, in 1967, the program was syndicated beginning in 1970. Amiable and deferential to his guests, Donahue could be fearless in addressing hot-button, even taboo topics (his first guest was atheist Madalyn Murray O'Hair). He explored such issues as feminism, homosexuality, civil rights, race, religion, abortion, the Vietnam war, segregation, natural childbirth, orgies, pornography, and new directions in male fashion (which allowed him to wear a skirt). He also hosted movie stars, athletes and politicians, who would face an hour of questions from a demanding audience."
1947,Article 1947,"Ina 2001 interview with the Television Academy, Donahue proudly proclaimed that his program was the first to feature male strippers. ""I'd like to tell you it was my idea! It wasn't. In fact, when it was suggested — by a woman — first thing I said was, 'Well, where are you gonna put the microphone?' And then when they're not stripping, I mean, what do we talk about? I didn't want to go near this program."" But he did, and it was the audience that came up with question topics: ""They included your mama, your wife, your grandmother, and your baby sister, too,"" he said."
1948,Article 1948,"""We were naughty before anybody ever heard of shock jocks. We never featured nudity, but we were naughty, and we got our mail and we had sponsors cancel."" They also ran nationally for 26 years, producing more than 6,000 episodes, and won 20 Emmys and  a Peabody Award."
1949,Article 1949,"Donahue inspired many later talk show hosts, from Oprah Winfrey to Ellen Degeneres. But his willingness to feature titillating topics also inspired Jerry Springer, Morton Downey Jr, and other purveyors of trash TV. As more sensational shows entered the market, Donahue's ratings suffered, and the show ended in 1996. He returned briefly to MSNBC in 2002, but was cancelled after six months."
1950,Article 1950,"In 2020, Donahue, a self-described feminist,talked with ""CBS Sunday Morning""about his show's popularity among women: ""Well, I had Gloria Steinem on my program very early. All the feminists somehow seemed to, sooner or later, show up on the 'Donahue' show. And we were thrilled with that, because they were good guests, including (Marlo Thomas)."""
1951,Article 1951,"He met the actress while she was a guest in 1977. They married three years later. In 2020, the year of their 40th anniversary, they jointly wrote a book, ""What Makes a Marriage Last: 40 Celebrated Couples Share with Us the Secrets to a Happy Life."""
1952,Article 1952,"The smoldering good looks and vulnerable performances of French actorAlain Delon(November 8, 1935-August 18, 2024), whether playing tough guys or tender lovers, made him one of the most appealing stars in world cinema in the 1960s and '70s. He was best known for his work with directors Luciano Visconti (""The Leopard"") and Jean-Pierre Melville (""Le Samouraï"")."
1953,Article 1953,"Delon made his first big impression in 1960's ""Purple Noon,"" an adaptation of the Patricia Highsmith thriller ""The Talented Mr. Ripley."" He followed with Visconti's ""Rocco and His Brothers""; Michelangelo Antonioni's ""L'Eclisse"" (costarring Monica Vitti); and ""The Leopard,"" as a young and seductive opportunist. The film co-starred Claudia Cardinale and Burt Lancaster."
1954,Article 1954,"Delon made brief sojourns in Hollywood films, including ""The Yellow Rolls-Royce"" (with Shirley MacLaine), ""Once a Thief"" (with Ann-Margret), and ""Scorpio,"" but most of his successes were in Europe: ""The Girl on a Motorcycle"" (with Marianne Faithfull), ""La Piscine"" (Romy Schneider and Jane Birkin), ""Le cercle rouge,"" ""Borsalino,"" ""The Assassination of Trotsky,"" ""Un flic,"" ""Swann in Love,"" and ""Mr. Klein,"" among the most notable."
1955,Article 1955,"While also working as a producer, Delon announced his retirement from acting in 1999, only to return in Bertrand Blier's ""Les Acteurs"" that same year. He also appeared in several police shows on TV, and on stage, in 2011, in ""An Ordinary Day,"" with his daughter, Anouchka."
1956,Article 1956,"He finally did quit acting in 2018,telling British GQwhat he really thought about the film industry today: ""It's a shallow, worthless era soured by money. We no longer film with a moving camera but a digital thing stuck on the end of your fist. No one gives a s*** about anything anymore. … Those who use the phrase 'It was better in my day' are old fools. But when I say it, it's different, because it's true: in my day, it was something else, it really was better. …"
1957,Article 1957,"""Look, I had incredible luck. I've been happy all my life; I filmed with the best. I did what I wanted, with who I wanted, when I wanted. I dwell on the past more than I think about the future, yes, because my past was extraordinary. Today just doesn't compare. A life like I had doesn't come around twice. That's why when it comes to retirement, I have no regrets."""
1958,Article 1958,"Though he was criticized for controversial statements he made in his later years regarding women, LGBTQ+ rights, and migrants, and for his support of France's far-right National Front, he was praised upon his death as ""a great friend of animals"" and ""a man with a big heart"" by the Brigitte Bardot Foundation, an organization dedicated to animal protection."
1959,Article 1959,"Two-time Oscar-nomineeGena Rowlands(June 19, 1930-August 14, 2024) was not only one of the most accomplished and celebrated actresses to appear in front of a camera; she was also a partner with her husband, director John Cassavetes, in crafting groundbreaking films that helped birth the independent cinema movement in the 1960s and '70s – an American counterpart to the French New Wave. Over four decades, Rowlands and Cassavetes made 10 uncompromising films outside the studio system, including ""Faces,"" ""Minnie and Moskowitz,"" ""A Woman Under the Influence,"" ""Opening Night,"" ""Gloria,"" and ""Love Streams."""
1960,Article 1960,"Speaking to the Associated Press in 2015 about Cassavetes (who died in 1989), Rowlands said, ""He had a particular sympathetic interest in women and their problems in society, how they were treated and how they solved and overcame what they needed to, so all his movies have some interesting women."""
1961,Article 1961,"Rowlands earned Oscar nominations for her performances in 1974's ""A Woman Under the Influence,"" playing a housewife and mother whose drinking barely masks her vulnerability and chaotic efforts to please; and ""Gloria"" (1980), as a chain-smoking, gun-toting former mobster's moll trying to protect a young boy from murderers while wearing five-inch heels."
1962,Article 1962,"In 2001 she told The Guardian, ""We totally financed all the films ourselves, except for 'A Woman Under the Influence,' for which [co-star] Peter Falk and his wife paid half. After John had done the screenplay for it, everyone said: 'Why does anyone want to see a picture about a crazy middle-aged dame?' But we were luckier than a lot of young directors now, because we were both established actors, and when we ran out of money (which was all the time), we would stop and each make a movie. It's harder for young writers and directors now, unless they are very wealthy, because whoever puts up the money always has a lot to say."""
1963,Article 1963,"She and Cassavetes met at the American School of Dramatic Arts, and married four months later. As Cassavetes pursued acting and directing (he financed his first feature, ""Shadows,"" with the money he earned from the TV series ""Johnny Staccato""), Rowlands appeared on live TV and the stage. A role in Paddy Chayefsky's play ""Middle of the Night"" opposite Edward G. Robinson took her to Hollywood, to appear in ""The High Cost of Loving."" Other films included ""Lonely Are the Brave"" with Kirk Douglas; ""The Spiral Road""; ""A Child Is Waiting"" (directed by Cassavetes); ""Two Minute Warning""; ""Tempest"" (directed by Paul Mazursky, and co-starring Cassavetes and Molly Ringwald in her screen debut); Woody Allen's ""Another Woman""; Paul Schrader's ""Light of Day""; and Jim Jarmusch's ""Night on Earth."" She also starred in the TV movie ""An Early Frost,"" as the mother of a young man with AIDS."
1964,Article 1964,"Her son, Nick Cassavetes, also a director, featured Rowlands in the film version of Nicholas Sparks' ""The Notebook,"" in which she played a woman with dementia, hearing the story of a long-ago romance."
1965,Article 1965,"Rowlands won three Primetime Emmy Awards (""The Betty Ford Story,"" ""Face of a Stranger,"" and ""Hysterical Blindness""), and a Daytime Emmy (""The Incredible Mrs. Ritchie"")."
1966,Article 1966,"Accepting an honorary Oscar from the motion picture academy in 2015, Rowlands said, ""You know what's wonderful about being an actress? You don't just live one life. You live many lives."""
1967,Article 1967,"With a Panama hat, a kazoo, and boundless optimism, entrepreneurWallace ""Wally"" Amos(July 1, 1936-August 13, 2024) created a cookie empire that made his name famous."
1968,Article 1968,"Born in Tallahassee, Florida, Amos moved to New York City at age 12 because of his parents' divorce. He lived with an aunt, Della Bryant, who taught him how to make chocolate chip cookies. A high school dropout, Amos joined the Air Force, then worked his way up from mailroom clerk to talent agent at the William Morris Agency – the first Black agent in the business, his son, Shawn Amos, said."
1969,Article 1969,"With $25,000 borrowed from the singers Marvin Gaye and Helen Reddy, Wally launched his cookie business, opening a cookie store on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles in 1975. By its second year, ""Famous Amos"" was selling a million dollars' worth of cookies annually."
1970,Article 1970,"He eventually lost control of the company, along with rights to the Famous Amos name. In one of his eight books, ""Man With No Name: Turn Lemons Into Lemonade,"" Amos explained how he lost Famous Amos even before it was sold for $63 million to a Taiwanese company in 1991. Despite robust sales, by 1985, the business was losing money, so Amos brought in outside investors. ""The new owners gobbled up more of my share until all of a sudden, I found I had lost all ownership in the company I founded,"" Amos wrote. The company changed ownership four times."
1971,Article 1971,"Daughter Sarah Amos said that, after parting ways with Famous Amos, her dad stopped baking for about two years. After rediscovering a love of baking, he opened a new cookie store in Honolulu, called Chip & Cookie, in 1991. He also helped build a muffin company, using his own name, Uncle Wally's."
1972,Article 1972,"Amos had said the Famous Amos cookies sold today are unlike his cookies, which had lots of chocolate, real butter, and pure vanilla extract. ""You can't compare a machine-made cookie with handmade cookie,"" he told the Associated Press. ""It's like comparing a Rolls Royce with a Volkswagen."""
1973,Article 1973,"He also gave motivational talks to corporations, universities and other groups, and became a children's literacy advocate, serving as spokesperson for Literacy Volunteers of America for 24 years, and cofounding the Chip & Cookie Read Aloud Foundation. He also hosted an adult educational TV series, ""Learn to Read."" In 1990 President George H.W. Bush presented Amos with the National Literacy Honors Award."
1974,Article 1974,"Abdul ""Duke"" Fakir(December 26, 1935-July 22, 2024) was the last surviving original member of the Motown group The Four Tops, known for such hits as ""I Can't Help Myself (Sugar Pie, Honey Bunch),"" ""Reach Out I'll Be There,"" and ""Baby I Need Your Loving."""
1975,Article 1975,"Fakir was not related to his singing partners – Levi Stubbs, Renaldo ""Obie"" Benson, and Lawrence Payton – but they were brothers on the stage since 1954 when they started as the Four Ames, poor kids growing up in Detroit singing on street corners. They spent their early years in small, often segregated clubs, polishing their stage act and versatile vocal style."
1976,Article 1976,"They finally burst forth in 1964, when Barry Gordy's Motown Records put out ""Baby, I Need Your Loving."" It was a hit. ""We were selling records with 'Baby, I Need Your Loving,'"" Fakir recalled for ""Sunday Morning"" in 1990. ""My mama was really in a bad way. I just asked Barry for an advance. He said, 'Well, how much you need?' And I said, 'About 10,000.' He said, 'What is this for?' And I said, 'I'm going to buy my mama a house.' He said, 'Well, here, take 20,000.' So I just went and bought her a house. Then I bought me 50 pairs of shoes and a Cadillac."""
1977,Article 1977,"Between 1964 and 1967, The Four Tops had 11 Top 20 hits, including ""It's the Same Old Song,"" ""Something About You,"" ""Shake Me, Wake Me (When It's Over),"" ""Standing in the Shadows of Love,"" ""Bernadette,"" and ""You Keep Running Away."" They also released three albums paired with The Supremes."
1978,Article 1978,"The hits were fewer after 1970, though 1973's ""Ain't No Woman (Like the One I Got),"" reached #4 when released by ABC/Dunhill, and 1981's ""When She Was My Girl,"" on the Casablanca label, hit #11. But the group, which had separated from Motown when Gordy moved the company to Los Angeles, had money in the bank, and a plan. Fakir recalled, ""We had a meeting about that – 'Look, I think it's slowing down here. It's not coming in every day. It's not falling out the sky, OK? And it's not going to keep doing that. So, now we've got to prepare. If you're not prepared, then let's start preparing for the future and let's take this nice little calm period, enjoy your families, and we'll work when we work and we'll just cool off.'"""
1979,Article 1979,"Between 1981 and 1995 they released six albums, including ""Indestructible."" But the band's lineup changed with the deaths of Payton in 1997, Benson in 2005, and Stubbs in 2008. Fakir continued touring with new members (including Payton's son, Lawrence Jr.)."
1980,Article 1980,"""As each one of them (the original members) passed a little bit of me left with them,"" Fakir told UK Music Reviews in 2021. ""When Levi left us, I found myself in a quandary as to what I was going to do from that moment on, but after a while I realized that the name together with the legacy that they had left us simply had to carry on, and judging by the audience reaction, it soon became pretty evident that I did the right thing and I really do feel good about that."""
1981,Article 1981,"The Four Tops were voted into the Rock Hall of Fame and the Grammy Hall of Fame. Fakir wrote a 2022 memoir, ""I'll Be There,"" and was working on a planned Broadway musical based on their lives."
1982,Article 1982,"British blues musician and songwriterJohn Mayall(November 29, 1933-July 22, 2024), whose band the Bluesbreakers was a training ground for Eric Clapton, Mick Fleetwood, John McVie and others, was credited with helping develop the English take on Chicago-style R&B. The writer of ""I'm Your Witchdoctor"", ""Crawling Up a Hill"" and ""Don't Waste My Time,"" Mayall was still performing in his late 80s – and was proud of his low profile."
1983,Article 1983,"""I've never had a hit record, I never won a Grammy Award, and Rolling Stone has never done a piece about me,"" he said in an interview with the Santa Barbara Independent in 2013. ""I'm still an underground performer."" He said he played for the love of the music he had first heard on his father's 78-rpm records."
1984,Article 1984,"Often called the ""father of British blues,"" Mayall's Bluesbreakers would feature a changing roster of players that included some of the most noteworthy musicians of the era, including Clapton, Fleetwood, McVie, Peter Green, Dick Heckstall-Smith, Jon Hiseman, Harvey Mandel, Jon Mark, Randy Resnick, Larry Taylor, Mick Taylor, Rick Vito and Ernie Watts."
1985,Article 1985,"Mick Taylor, who succeeded Green as a Bluesbreaker in the late 1960s, said in a 1979 interview with writer Jas Obrecht that Mayall gave his fellow bandmates wide latitude to solo. ""You'd have complete freedom to do whatever you wanted,"" Taylor said. ""You could make as many mistakes as you wanted, too."""
1986,Article 1986,"Mayall made a permanent move to the U.S. in the late '60s, marked by his 1968 album ""Blues from Laurel Canyon."" He disbanded the Bluesbreakers, and in 1969 released the live album ""The Turning Point."" He would reform the Bluesbreakers, but then retired the name and performed as the John Mayall Band."
1987,Article 1987,"CongresswomanSheila Jackson Lee(January 12, 1950-July 19, 2024) helped lead federal efforts to protect women from domestic violence, and to have Juneteenth (the anniversary of when the last enslaved people in America gained their freedom) recognized as a federal holiday."
1988,Article 1988,"A native of Queens, New York, Jackson Lee graduated from Yale and earned her law degree at the University of Virginia. She was a judge in Houston before being elected to the city council in 1989, and later ran for Congress. The Texas Democrat represented her Houston-based district since 1995 (a seat once held by Barbara Jordan), and served on the House Judiciary Committee."
1989,Article 1989,"She quickly established herself as a fierce advocate for women and minorities, and a leader for House Democrats on many social justice issues. Her rewrite of the Violence Against Women Act included protections for Native American, transgender and immigrant women. She was an advocate for gay rights and an early opponent of the Iraq War in 2003."
1990,Article 1990,"ComedianBob Newhart(September 5, 1929-July 18, 2024), with his classic comedy albums and two hit sitcoms on CBS, ""The Bob Newhart Show"" (1972-78) and ""Newhart"" (1982-90), played it clean and sweet. A minimalist, his observational humor, delivered with perfect deadpan timing, cloaked a subversive streak in conjuring ridiculous situations, as when a newly-minted guard at the Empire State Building struggles to find in his employee's manual how to deal with King Kong climbing the façade."
1991,Article 1991,"""That's the way I've always considered my comedy, is being the last sane man and going to people and saying, 'Excuse me, but isn't this crazy?'""he told ""Sunday Morning"" in 2002."
1992,Article 1992,"Born outside of Chicago during the Great Depression, with a stammer that only seemed to accentuate his dry wit, Newhart served in the Army, flunked out of law school, and became an accountant. He admits he wasn't good with numbers, but hewasgood at making people laugh. Delivery was key. He admitted that while his pieces might not seem funny on paper (a Madison Avenue ad man criticizing Abe Lincoln's Gettysburg Address), his cadences would sell them."
1993,Article 1993,"He actually started off with a writing partner, but after they split up, Newhart performed solo, reacting to an unseen partner on the other end of his phone conversations – which made the bits even funnier. Here he is imagining the boss back in Old England getting a phone call from Sir Walter Raleigh about a New World discovery: ""Are, are you sayingsnuff, Walt? Uh-huh. And what's snuff? … You take a pinch of tobacco and … and you stick it up your nose, and … and it makes you sneeze. I imagine it would, Walt, yeah."""
1994,Article 1994,"A disc jockey friend sent a tape of Newhart's routines to scouts from Warner Brothers Records. ""So, they listened to them, and they said, `Oh, we think they're funny and we'll record you at your next nightclub.' And then I said, 'Well, see, we have a problem there. Because I've never played a nightclub.' They said, 'Well, then we're going to have to get you in a nightclub.' So, they got me into a club in Houston, Texas, called The Tidelands."""
1995,Article 1995,"He hit it big in 1960, with three Grammy Awards for his debut album, ""The Button-Down Mind of Bob Newhart"" (which won album of the year), and its follow-up, ""The Button-Down Mind Strikes Back!"" (best comedy performance – spoken word). He beat out Harry Belafonte, Nat King Cole and Frank Sinatra. ""I don't think Frank was thrilled that a stand-up comic beat out his album!""he told ""Sunday Morning"" in 2020."

But when he first arrived, Mays was hitless in his first series. In 1979he told ""Sunday Morning""how Giants manager Leo Durocher boosted his confidence: ""Leo gave me what you call motivation. The only thing he told me, just a couple lines: 'You'll be my center fielder as long as I'm manager here, and you really don't have to hit. Just go out and play center field.' And I think by saying that, I think I relaxed a little bit, and I just started hitting without any problem."" In fact, in his first year with the Giants, Mays hit .274 with 127 hits, including 20 homers, and scored 59 runs, earning him the National League Rookie of the Year Award."
2072,Article 2072,"Over 23 seasons, beginning with the Birmingham Black Barons in the Negro Leagues, and then with the Giants, in New York and San Francisco, and then back in New York with the Mets, Mays racked up 3,293 hits, including 660 home runs (only Babe Ruth and Hank Aaron, at that time, had more), 1,909 RBIs, and a .301 batting average, not to mention 339 stolen bases, a Gold Glove, and two MVP Awards."
2073,Article 2073,"But from his entire career on the field, his most memorable play was undoubtedly ""The Catch,"" in Game 1 of the 1954 World Series. With the score tied in the top of the eighth and with two men on base, Cleveland's Vic Mertz hit a drive deep to center field. Racing to the wall, Mays made a basket catch over his shoulder, his back to home plate, and quickly turned to fire the ball back to the infield, preventing two or three runs. The Giants won the game, and the championship."
2074,Article 2074,"Mays talked with ""Sunday Morning"" about the importance of being what he called a ""complete ball player."" ""You can't just run and not hit, or hit home runs, or hit for a batting average. I was active on the ball field, and I had to please the stand just as well as [if] I was on stage or something. When I went to the ball park, I tried to do things a little different sometimes and make sure the fans got their money's worth."""
2075,Article 2075,"Mays' exuberance earned him the nickname ""Say Hey Kid,"" and his attention to young fans earned him lasting affection. In 2011, visiting the site of the Polo Grounds in Manhattan, Mays talked of how youngsters would invite him to play in their stickball games. ""I used to have maybe 10 kids come to my window,"" he said. ""Every morning, they'd come at 9 o'clock. They'd knock on my window, get me up. … They'd give me a chance to go shower. They'd give me a chance to eat breakfast. But I had to be out there at 9:30, because that's when they wanted to play. So, I played with them for about maybe an hour."""
2076,Article 2076,Mays was voted into the Hall of Fame in 1979 (his first year of eligibility). In 2015 he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom.
2077,Article 2077,"""It was ironic that we'd done all this work to come and explore the moon, and what we really discovered was the Earth,"" astronautWilliam Anders(Oct. 17, 1933-June 7, 2024), a member of the Apollo 8 crew,told ""CBS Sunday Morning"" in 2018."
2078,Article 2078,"Fifty years prior, on Christmas Eve, Anders, James Lovell and Frank Borman became the first humans to orbit the moon. Describing the crater-covered lunar surface proved almost as difficult as getting there. ""I said that it looked like dirty beach sand,"" Anders recalled. ""That's how I described it, thus gaining the wrath of poets worldwide!"""
2079,Article 2079,"But it was a photo that Anders took of the Earth, rising above the moon like a big blue marble, that brought all of humanity – everything that mankind had ever known – together in a brilliant, fragile image. Anders took some of the precious little film they had on board – film that was supposed to be used for capturing the moon – to take the picture of our home world. Anders said, ""Even though that wasn't in the flight plan ... hell with that, you know? Here was a beautiful shot."""
2080,Article 2080,"Known as ""Earthrise,"" it became one of the most reproduced images ever, in part because no other photograph summed up our place in the universe quite like it. It was reproduced on a postage stamp, and became a catalyst for the environmental movement. Life magazine featured it on the cover of its 2003 anthology, ""100 Photographs That Changed the World."""
2081,Article 2081,"Born in Hong Kong (his father was a Navy officer), Anders was graduated from the Naval Academy, but accepted his wings in the Air Force, rising to major. He also earned a master's degree in nuclear engineering, before joining NASA."
2082,Article 2082,"Retiring from active duty following the Apollo mission, Anders served on the National Aeronautics and Space Council, the Atomic Energy Commission, and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and as ambassador to Norway. He retired from the Air Force Reserve as a major general in 1988, and co-founded the Heritage Flight Museum in Bellingham, Wash."
2083,Article 2083,"""Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious"" may appear unspeakable, but it's one of the most fondly remembered lyrics from the songwriting team the Sherman Brothers, who created catchy classics for ""Mary Poppins,"" ""The Jungle Book"" and ""Chitty Chitty Bang Bang"" – songs that were infectious, ubiquitous and unforgettable."
2084,Article 2084,"""They call it an earworm – you know, you can't get it out of your ear. It just crawls in there and stays,""Richard Sherman(June 12, 1928-May 25, 2024)told ""CBS Sunday Morning"" in 2013. He was clear-eyed about their theme park perennial, ""It's a Small World (After All),"" introduced at the 1964 World's Fair. In a 2011 appearance at the Walt Disney Family Museum in San Francisco, Sherman said of the reaction to that song, ""People either want to kiss us or kill us!"""
2085,Article 2085,"Growing up, older brother Robert Sherman aspired to write novels; Richard, symphonies. One day their songwriting father gave them a challenge: ""'I bet you couldn't team up together and write a song that some kid would give up his lunch money to buy a record of it … Yeah, I don't think you have enough brains to do that.' And he turned around and left,"" Richard recalled."
2086,Article 2086,"Within a decade the brothers had had hits recorded by Annette Funicello (""Tall Paul,"" ""Wild Willie""), Johnny Burnette (""You're Sixteen""), and Fabian (""Got the Feeling"")."
2087,Article 2087,"For movies, Richard and Robert became one of the most prolific songwriting duos of all time, from comedies (""Summer Magic,"" ""The Happiest Millionaire,"" ""Follow Me, Boys!,"" ""The One and Only, Genuine, Original Family Band,"" ""Bedknobs and Broomsticks""), to animation (""The Sword in the Stone,"" ""Winnie the Pooh,"" ""The Aristocats,"" ""Charlotte's Web,"" ""Snoopy Come Home""), to musicals (""Chitty Chitty Bang Bang,"" ""Tom Sawyer,"" ""The Slipper and the Rose"")."
2088,Article 2088,"But their most famous tunes were from ""Mary Poppins,"" inspired by P.L. Travers' magical nanny. ""A Spoonful of Sugar,"" ""Chim Chim Cher-ee,"" ""Jolly Holiday,"" ""Let's Go Fly a Kite,"" and the irrepressibly bouncy ""Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious."""

2091,Article 2091,"In a 1969 interview with the Los Angeles Times, Robert Sherman (who died in 2012) explained the songwriting approach taken by himself and Richard: ""We don't like the dark side of things, and we only want to entertain people. We like singable songs as opposed to, say, performers' songs. We don't write for someone, we write for everyone."""
2092,Article 2092,"""I wouldn't describe myself as a miserable person, but there are those who would say that my outlook on humanity is pretty miserable,"" writerCaleb Carr(August 2, 1955-May 23, 2024)told ""CBS Sunday Morning"" in 2005. He came to wide attention with his bestselling 1994 novel ""The Alienist,"" about the hunt for a serial killer in 19th century New York City, in a neighborhood that, he wrote, ""knew little of laws, man-made or otherwise."""
2093,Article 2093,"He followed ""The Alienist"" with a sequel, ""The Angel of Darkness,"" and with a Sherlock Holmes mystery, ""The Italian Secretary."" ""It was just supposed to be a little cottage industry that would give me a stipend to live off of while I was doing the work that I had always done and was trained to do,"" he explained."
2094,Article 2094,"Carr's true calling was military history, as an editor of the Quarterly Journal of Military History, and as a college professor at Bard College outside New York City."
2095,Article 2095,"He grew up on New York's Lower East Side, a then-crime-filled neighborhood where violence was a part of everyday life, including at home. ""My father was a violent person by nature,"" Carr said. ""He was a tempestuous person, and my father told me repeatedly nobody likes a smart-ass."" And what effect did that have? ""Made me that much more of a smart-ass every time he said it. It's what happens with children if it's accompanied by a swift smack to the back of your head."""
2096,Article 2096,"His father, Lucien, a news editor and member of the Beat poets' coterie, killed a man when he was 19, and served two years in prison before being pardoned. Carr said his father never spoke about it, which gave him more of a desire to figure out where personal violence comes from."
2097,Article 2097,"In the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, Carr published ""The Lessons of Terror."" He traced 2,000 years of war, arguing that strategies that target civilians have always ultimately failed. ""We must develop a way for American military power to be projected in a more enlightened fashion,"" he said. ""We have to, or the entire world – even more of the world that hates us now – will hate us later."""
2098,Article 2098,"He also co-wrote ""America Invulnerable: The Quest for Absolute Security from 1812 to Star Wars"" (1989), and ""Killing Time"" (2000), a dystopian murder mystery set in the Information Age."
2099,Article 2099,"And beyond military history and period thrillers, Carr also worked on the libretto of an opera, ""Merlin,"" about the magician in King Arthur's court. ""Traditional styles are very comforting to me,"" he said. ""The modern world is a very uncomfortable place for me. … It's hard to look at the modern world as a student of the things that I study and see it as anything but pretty horrendous. It's not a comfortable place in terms of where our values are going. We are heading into a very dark age."""
2100,Article 2100,"His final published work was the 2024 memoir of his devoted cat, Masha: ""My Beloved Monster: Masha, the Half-Wild Rescue Cat Who Rescued Me."""
2101,Article 2101,"But despite his intimations of misery, he praised his students, who are studying the past in hopes of changing the future. ""They're all interested in it.

2104,Article 2104,"""He was just the worst human being, Merle Jeeter!""Coleman told The AV Club in 2012. ""That's kind of where it all started, as far as people's belief that I could do comedy, particularly that negative, caustic, cynical kind of guy. I was pretty good at doing that kind of humor. So that was a huge turning point, and it was a lot of fun."""
2105,Article 2105,"He carried the character over into the spinoff series, ""Fernwood Tonight."""
2106,Article 2106,"Then came the revenge comedy ""9 to 5,"" in which he played Franklin Hart, the sexist, conspiratorial boss who gets his comeuppance from female staffers played by Jane Fonda, Lily Tomlin and Dolly Parton. ""All three of those girls were [great] to me,"" he told AV Club, ""because they were several steps up the ladder from where I was in my career. … Almost icons in their fields, if you want to break it down like that. And here's this guy coming off of 'Mary Hartman,' which is not too shabby. But it was late-night TV. Anyway, what I'm alluding to is that all three of them went out of their way to make me feel equal. There's no other way to put it. Status-wise and talent-wise, they all made me feel extremely secure and were very supportive."""
2107,Article 2107,"The film was a box office hit and put him on the map, in such high-profile films as ""On Golden Pond,"" ""Tootsie,"" ""WarGames,"" ""Cloak and Dagger,"" and ""Dragnet."" He also starred in the short-lived sitcom ""Buffalo Bill,"" playing an egotistical talk show host. He followed that series with ""The Slap Maxwell Story,"" playing a (what else?) egotistical sportswriter. It lasted only one season, but earned Coleman a Golden Globe. Coleman also received six Emmy nominations, winning one award for the TV drama ""Sworn to Silence."""

2109,Article 2109,"In 1994 Coleman talked with The New York Timesabout the seemingly disagreeable traits that the ""Dabney Coleman character,"" on shows like ""Madman of the People,"" would exhibit, and how he'd wring comedy from them: ""Writers write wrong for me sometimes,"" he said. ""They're trying to be funny, usually. Trying to make a joke. And that's not what I do, you know. It's not jokes; it's not words. It's acting. It's acting funny."""

2111,Article 2111,"While majoring in journalism at the University of Western Ontario, she sold a story about a lonely teacher, ""The Dimensions of a Shadow,"" to CBC Radio, and published work in her school's literary journal.

2112,Article 2112,"Over the next 40 years, her reputation and readership only grew, with many of her stories first appearing in The New Yorker. Her prose style was straightforward, her tone matter-of-fact, but her plots revealed unending disruption and disappointments: broken marriages, violent deaths, madness and dreams unfulfilled, or never even attempted. Among her most acclaimed works were ""The Beggar Maid,"" ""The Children Stay,"" ""Dance of the Happy Shades,"" ""Family Furnishings,"" ""Lives of Girls and Women,"" ""The Love of a Good Woman,"" ""Miles City, Montana,"" ""The Moons of Jupiter,"" and ""Runaway."""

2118,Article 2118,"Corman's independent streak was fundamental. ""I do have a hard time with authority,""he admitted to ""Sunday Morning"" in 2010. ""I was in the Navy for two years. They were the worst two years of my life. Any rule they set out, I felt it is my duty to break that rule."""
2119,Article 2119,"Corman described his production methods: ""I really worked rather efficiently. I planned very heavily in advance.""Efficientlyis an understatement. He shot ""Machine Gun Kelly,"" a gangster film with Charles Bronson, in just 10 days. ""Little Shop of Horrors"" (in which a houseplant expresses a taste for blood) was shot in two days and a night. ""There was a set standing at an independent studio in Hollywood where I had my offices,"" Corman recalled. ""And it was a very good set ... and why let a set go to waste?

And the audience has a high level of expectation and, if they get something that they like and then they're told it'snotgreat, they feel that they've done something wrong. I mean, they feel they should only focus on the 'great' things. And the artists feel that they should only make 'great' paintings, you know?

2135,Article 2135,"As Stella pushed the boundaries of abstraction with his paintings and prints, along the way he developed a few artistic obsessions. The painted surfaces of canvases and paper became the painted surfaces of assemblages and sculptures made out of slick fiberglass or aluminum tubing, including some in the shape of a star. (Frank's surname in Italian does meanstar.) Carbon fiber materials and 3-D printing allowed Stella to explore ever-more challenging shapes, creating stars that stood 21 feet high."
2136,Article 2136,"Stella said he wasn't one to consider his legacy. ""I went from being a young artist to a middle-aged artist to a mature artist, and now I'm an 'is-he-still-alive?' artist,"" the octogenarian told ""Sunday Morning"" in 2021. ""It would be probably a lot more satisfying to people if I'd started out likethis, and then ended up with the black paintings.

Gifted enough to sell 40 million records and run his own record label."

2247,Article 2247,"But the song that made Keith a superstar was his emotional response to the attacks of 9/11. He said that he wrote ""Courtesy of the Red, White and Blue"" in 20 minutes, just days after the attacks, partly as a tribute to his father, a veteran. Subtitled ""The Angry American,"" the song doesn't mince words:"
2248,Article 2248,"You'll be sorry that you messed with the US of A,because we'll put a boot in your ass,it's the American way."
2249,Article 2249,"The song brought him much attention, pro and con, including a public feud with the Dixie Chicks' Natalie Maines, who called it ignorant. Keith rode the song and the controversy all the way to the bank."
2250,Article 2250,"He followed with ""American Soldier,"" which become a favorite of U.S. forces overseas, many of whom attended his USO tours. But standing with the troops didn't mean he stood with America's decision to go into Iraq. ""When the Iraq war started, I was a little mad because we didn't finish what we started in Afghanistan,"" he told ""Sunday Morning."" ""But our troops had to move on into Iraq, our government asked them to go do it for whatever reason. We won't know for probably 20 or 30 years whether it was the right thing to do or not."""
2251,Article 2251,"And while the songs meant many pegged Keith as conservative, he said he disappointed many Republicans who called him for support: ""They go, 'You're a Republican, right?' And you go, 'Well, I'm actually a lot of times Democrat.' And then they go, 'Oh, sorry.' And the Democrats want so bad, the real liberals really want to hate me, and then they go, 'I still hate you, but I can't believe you're a Democrat.' … So, I'm not a real political guy. I'm a very patriotic guy."""

2255,Article 2255,"Ina 2015 interview with the Hollywood Reporter, Weathers recalled that he was asked to audition with the film's writer, Stallone (an actor with few credits at that time). Weathers read the scene but felt it didn't work. He remarked, ""I could do a lot better if you got me a real actor to work with."""
2256,Article 2256,"The verbal jab – instead of putting him off – made Stallone feel it was in character with Apollo Creed. ""Sometimes the mistakes are the ones that get you the gig,"" Weathers said. Or, the falsehoods (he lied that he had boxing experience)."

2267,Article 2267,"In his near-half-century at CBS News, Osgood worked on virtually every broadcast on the network, including the ""CBS Morning News,"" the ""CBS Evening News with Dan Rather,"" and the ""CBS Sunday Night News,"" and interviewed such luminaries as chef Julia Child, graffiti artist-turned-gallery star Keith Haring, painter Andrew Wyeth, sculptor Louise Nevelson, and singer-songwriter Sting."
2268,Article 2268,"A gifted newswriter (he was often referred to as the network's poet-in-residence) with his trademark bowtie, Osgood was called ""one of the last great broadcast writers"" by Charles Kuralt, whom Osgood succeeded as host of ""Sunday Morning"" in 1994. During his run on the magazine program, it reached its highest ratings levels in three decades, and three times earned the Daytime Emmy as Outstanding Morning Program."
2269,Article 2269,"He continued writing his ""Osgood File"" radio reports up to four times a day, five days a week. ""Short words, short sentences, short paragraphs,"" Osgood said. ""There's nothing that can't be improved by making it shorter and better."""
2270,Article 2270,"And his reports often rhymed, offering piquant commentary on the day's events. He said some stories were just naturals that he knew right away he could make rhymes of in the rushed 60 to 90 minutes he had each morning to compose them. He said, ""Some news is good and some is worse, and some news goes from bad to verse."""

2274,Article 2274,"But not everyone in the audience was a fan. ""We actually had a death threat in the newsroom,"" Osgood recalled in 2016. ""Somebody called up and he said, 'Tell Osgood that if he does any more of those stupid poems, I'm gonna kill him!'"""
2275,Article 2275,"Among his broadcasting honors, Osgood received the George Foster Peabody Award, the National Association of Broadcasters Distinguished Service Award, and five Emmys, including a lifetime achievement honor in 2017.

(He had a Top 40 hit in 1966 with his ballad for the armed forces, ""Gallant Men."") He also performed with The New York Pops, The Boston Pops and The Mormon Tabernacle Choir."
2278,Article 2278,"Musical satiristPeter Schickele(July 17, 1935-January 16, 2024) made a name for himself as a performer and a composer of music for the concert hall and films. But his name was overshadowed by that of his creation: P.D.Q. Bach, described as the least talented of Johann Sebastian Bach's 20-ish children, whose compositions would, in the words of Schickele, ""catapult him into obscurity."" No one knew the composer even existed until Schickele said he discovered one of P.D.Q. Bach's manuscripts being used as a coffee strainer at a castle in Bavaria."
2279,Article 2279,"The satirist actually created P.D.Q. while on the faculty of the Juilliard School of Music in New York, creating works for the concert hall that lampooned classical music tropes, while adding unusual instruments (shower hose, police siren) in the mix. Schickele's musical heroes included Bach, Beethoven, Brahms, and Spike Jones. ""I grew up with the Three Stooges, as well as Bach and Mozart, and it's all there,"" he told ""Sunday Morning"" in 1984."
2280,Article 2280,"""Most satirists make fun of what they like, not what they don't like; and so, musically, it's very much a satire of love,"" Schickele said. ""I think the only aspect of it that I wouldn't mind seeing changed a bit is the aura of sort of sacredness that surrounds the concert scene."""
2281,Article 2281,"The titles were punny enough: ""Hansel & Gretel & Ted & Alice"" (which Schickele called ""an opera in one unnatural act""),   ""Concerto for Horn and Hardart,"" ""Eine Kleine Nichtmusik,"" ""Erotica Variations,"" ""Fanfare for the Common Cold,"" ""The Short-Tempered Clavier,"" ""Concerto for Piano vs. Orchestra,"" ""The Only Piece Ever Written for Violin and Tuba,"" and a ""simply grand"" opera titled ""The Abduction of Figaro."""
2282,Article 2282,"He would spend half the year writing serious compositions, and the other half doing P.D.Q. Bach music, which was released as albums, such as ""The Stoned Guest,"" ""Music You Can't Get Out of Your Head,"" and ""1712 Overture and Other Musical Assaults."" His book, ""The Definitive Biography of P.D.Q. Bach,"" sold 100,000 copies."
2283,Article 2283,"If there is one characteristic of P.D.Q. Bach's music that stands out above all others, it's what Schickele referred to as ""manic plagiarism."" ""Now, many 18th century composers, sometimes even the greatest ones, like Haydn and Mozart, would occasionally use a theme by one of their colleagues, but I think P.D.Q. Bach was the only composer who worked on tracing paper,"" Schickele said, introducing one of P.D.Q.'s pieces."
2284,Article 2284,"Classical music may be serious business, but not when Schickele was involved. At performances in which he introduced the discoveries of yet more P.D.Q. works, he might arrive via a rope dangling from the balcony."
2285,Article 2285,"Schickele told ""Sunday Morning"" that rehearsals are important, if only to prevent fits of laughter from affecting the musicians' playing: ""One of the reasons we have rehearsals is so that musicians can laugh. But, hopefully, in the performance, musicians are going to have heard the music enough so that they can control themselves, particularly the wind players, of course, we're concerned about, because the string players can laugh and still keep going, but the wind players definitely pose a problem."""
2286,Article 2286,"Veteran stage and television actorJoyce Randolph(October 21, 1924-January 13, 2024) was best remembered as Trixie, the wife of the dim Ed Norton, on the classic sitcom ""The Honeymooners."" She was the last surviving cast member of the beloved sitcom that also starred Jackie Gleason, Audrey Meadows and Art Carney."
2287,Article 2287,"Originating as a skit on Gleason's 1950s variety show, ""Cavalcade of Stars,"" ""The Honeymooners"" became a series of its own in 1955. Its one season on CBS, comprised of 39 episodes, would entertain generations in syndicated reruns."
2288,Article 2288,"Randolph retired from acting once the show ended, partly because the oversized impact of the character meant she was typecast. Active with fundraisers, Broadway openings and the U.S.O., Randolph said she didn't fully realize the impact of the show until her son attended college in the early 1980s. ""He came home and said, 'Did you know that guys and girls come up to me and ask, 'Is your mom really Trixie?'"" she told The San Antonio Express in 2000. ""I guess he hadn't paid much attention before then."""
2289,Article 2289,"Ina 2007 interview with The New York Times, Randolph said she received no royalties from the syndication of the original episodes, but did so once ""lost"" episodes – sketches repackaged from Gleason's variety shows – were aired."

2291,Article 2291,"Johns was the fourth generation of actors in her family (she was born in Pretoria, South Africa, because her parents were touring at the time), and was first carried on stage at age three weeks.

2293,Article 2293,"The following year she played Mrs. Banks opposite Julie Andrews' magical nanny in ""Mary Poppins."" Meeting with Walt Disney (who had produced a couple of her '50s films), she agreed to consider taking the role if she had a solo number in the musical. Disney promised her that he had one specially for her – and then, raced over to the Sherman Brothers to ask them to hurriedly write a solo number for Mrs. Banks."
2294,Article 2294,"On stage Johns starred in a 1956 Broadway production of George Bernard Shaw's ""Major Barbara,"" directed by Charles Laughton, and, in 1963, Shaw's ""Too True to Be Good.""

2297,Article 2297,"Known as a perfectionist, she took roles that were complicated and multi-faceted. ""As far as I'm concerned, I'm not interested in playing the role on only one level,"" she told The Associated Press in 1990. ""The whole point of first-class acting is to make a reality of it. To be real. And I have to make sense of it in my own mind in order to be real."""
2298,Article 2298,"Though she had, by her accounts, retired ""many times,"" she kept returning to acting, with appearances on TV (""Batman,"" ""Little Gloria … Happy at Last,"" ""The Love Boat,"" ""Cheers,"" ""Murder, She Wrote"") and films (""The Ref,"" ""While You Were Sleeping,"" ""Superstar""). ""The theater is just part of my life,"" she told the AP. ""It probably uses my highest sense of intelligence, so therefore I have to come back to it, to realize that I've got the talent. I'm not as good doing anything else."""

2760,Article 2760,"But Israel's military said the attack could have been much larger had it not carried out a massive overnight preemptive strike inside Southern Lebanon, apparently involving around 100 fighter jets. Hezbollah has said its strikes were in retaliation for the assassination of Fuad Shukr, one of the group's most senior commanders, in Beirut last month."

2775,Article 2775,"Tell me, was this friendly fire? Did Hezbollah, as they claim, actually cause some Israeli casualties?"
2776,Article 2776,"AMBASSADOR MICHAEL HERZOG: So, what happened yesterday is that we identify concrete planning and preparation by Hezbollah to launch a massive missile and drone attack into Israel, and we carried the real-time operation in order to degrade those capabilities that were about to be launched at Israel."
2777,Article 2777,"We were successful. Nevertheless, they launched several hundred rockets into Israel and also drones that were aimed at Central Israel, and we intercepted all of them. One of our soldiers was killed by the debris of Israeli interceptors."
2778,Article 2778,MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you assess at this point that we are escalating towards a regional war or that we are taking a step back? Is there risk of escalation?
2779,Article 2779,AMBASSADOR MICHAEL HERZOG: I believe that the success of our operation yesterday prevented an escalation to a major war.
2780,Article 2780,The threat is still there. We still need a settlement with Hezbollah in Southern Lebanon. They followed Hamas by launching the war with Israel on October 8. And they have been firing thousands of rockets into Israel since then.
2781,Article 2781,"We give a chance to diplomacy, and we hope it works. But, if not, we have nearly 70,000 people in Israel, Northern Israel, away from their homes, refugees in their own country, and we have to make sure they can go back safely to their homes."

2783,Article 2783,It's being reported that Israel and Hezbollah have been trading messages back and forth not to escalate. I know that the Qatari prime minister is headed to Iran tomorrow with a message not to escalate. Do you believe that you can avoid a direct attack by Iran on Israel?
2784,Article 2784,AMBASSADOR MICHAEL HERZOG: I believe so.
2785,Article 2785,"I think the Iranians are contemplating an attack on Israel, but decided for now to put it on hold. And I think the main reason for that was deterrent messages from Israel and the U.S. and a very strong U.S. posture in the region, which tells you that you can deter them."
2786,Article 2786,"MARGARET BRENNAN: There are 40,000 U.S. troops now in the region. What is it that you think General C.Q. Brown will do when he arrives in Israel later today? Is this further planning for potential attacks?"

2788,Article 2788,"However, there is room for miscalculation. And I think part of his regional visit is to make sure that everything is under control. Again, the U.S. posture in the region is very strong and I think played a role in deterring Iran."

2792,Article 2792,"As Secretary Blinken said a few days ago, the U.S. put forward a bridging proposal, which was accepted by Israel, and now it's up to Hamas to say if they accept it or not. So they did send their representative. But we're still not 100 percent sure that they are in the game. We certainly hope so. And, if that is the case, we can make progress towards a deal."
2793,Article 2793,"MARGARET BRENNAN: The secretary of state did say the bridging proposal was accepted. But then your prime minister has said things publicly that seem to contradict that in terms of the specifics, particularly among that Philadelphi Corridor."
2794,Article 2794,What is reality?
2795,Article 2795,AMBASSADOR MICHAEL HERZOG: The reality is that we are not obliged to leave the Philadelphi Corridor at this phase. We are reducing our forces there.
2796,Article 2796,We had constructive talks in Egypt a few days ago. We are well-coordinated with the U.S. administration. We're waiting for Hamas to see if they are in the game.
2797,Article 2797,"MARGARET BRENNAN: When you say in this phase, are you being specific in saying that's not part of phase one of this multiphase diplomatic deal the U.S. is trying to broker?"

2799,Article 2799,"And phase one, we hope to get as many live hostages out as possible. It comes with a pause in our military operation for at least 42 days. And, in that period, we hope that, again, we can release as – get out as many live hostages as possible. Every day that passes endangers their lives."

2806,Article 2806,"Just on the news of the moment, CENTCOM has about 40,000 U.S. troops in the region, this real muscular show of force. How concerned are you about miscalculation and blowback to those U.S. forces?"
2807,Article 2807,LT. GEN. H.R. MCMASTER (RET.): Yes.
2808,Article 2808,"Well, what I'm concerned about, Margaret, is that those forces will be constrained in what they're able to do in response. I think what we have seen is a reluctance to act like we know what the return address is for this violence."
2809,Article 2809,"And, of course, the return address is Iran. And I think all Americans…"
2810,Article 2810,MARGARET BRENNAN: What does that mean exactly? What do you want to do..
2811,Article 2811,(CROSSTALK)
2812,Article 2812,"LT. GEN. H.R. MCMASTER (RET.): Well, what it means is, Iran is pursuing a strategy that – in which it is willing to expend every Arab life, every Palestinian life, every Lebanese life, in pursuit of its objective of destroying Israel."
2813,Article 2813,"Meanwhile, Iran is continuing to funnel weapons not only into Southern Lebanon, but to essentially a proxy army in Syria, into the West Bank. And this is why the Philadelphi Corridor is so important to Israel…"

2815,Article 2815,LT. GEN. H.R. MCMASTER (RET.): … is to keep Hamas isolated from a resupply from the Iranians as well.
2816,Article 2816,"At the same time, Iran is racing to produce a nuclear device. So I think what we have to recognize is this horrible situation in the region that's been going on for 40 years, right?"

2826,Article 2826,MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.
2827,Article 2827,"LT. GEN. H.R. MCMASTER (RET.): … the reluctance really to confront Iran directly and impose costs on Iran, that actually gives Iran license to escalate on their own terms with impunity."
2828,Article 2828,"MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, this is just one of many extremely serious situations that the next commander in chief will be walking into."
2829,Article 2829,It doesn't go away in January.
2830,Article 2830,LT. GEN. H.R. MCMASTER (RET.): Right.
2831,Article 2831,MARGARET BRENNAN: And that's why I want to get to some of what you wrote about in your book. You had this front-row seat. You advised Donald Trump on very sensitive national security matters.
2832,Article 2832,"You write he found it difficult to distinguish – quote – ""between those who brought him sound analysis and those real or imagined who brought him hackneyed bromides. He'd say outlandish things, like go bomb the drugs in Mexico, or why don't we take out the whole North Korean army during one of their parades?"""
2833,Article 2833,"If Trump wins reelection, will he be able to recruit high-quality advisers who can actually help him make sound decisions?"
2834,Article 2834,"LT. GEN. H.R. MCMASTER (RET.): Margaret, I think so, especially in confirmed positions, and if it's a Trump administration."
2835,Article 2835,MARGARET BRENNAN: Because Congress would stop him from putting someone who isn't quality? Is that what you're saying?
2836,Article 2836,"LT. GEN. H.R. MCMASTER (RET.): Well, I think so. You know, I think so, and there are people who are willing to serve who can help do what we tried to do in that first year."

2839,Article 2839,LT. GEN. H.R. MCMASTER (RET.): … to produce policy outcomes that advanced America's interests.

2841,Article 2841,"MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Iran continued with its nuclear development after Trump exited the nuclear deal, against the advice of his secretary of state and his defense secretary."
2842,Article 2842,So…
2843,Article 2843,"LT. GEN. H.R. MCMASTER (RET.): I'm talking more about like the sanctions relief, Margaret…"
2844,Article 2844,MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.
2845,Article 2845,"LT. GEN. H.R. MCMASTER (RET.): … and the degree to which not enforcing the Trump era sanctions had really resulted in about $100 billion transferred to the Iranians, which they have used to intensify their proxy wars in the region, from Iraq to Yemen to Syria to Lebanon and obviously to Gaza with the October 7 attacks."
2846,Article 2846,"MARGARET BRENNAN: You detail specific examples of China's Xi Jinping, Vladimir Putin, even Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu manipulating Donald Trump."
2847,Article 2847,LT. GEN. H.R. MCMASTER (RET.): Right.

2849,Article 2849,"You wrote that: ""Trump's lack of historical knowledge made him susceptible to Xi Jinping's efforts to generate sympathy.'"
2850,Article 2850,"So what is the scenario you fear, that, in a second term, Donald Trump pulls U.S. troops out of Asia or that he brokers a transaction to give up Taiwan?"
2851,Article 2851,LT. GEN. H.R. MCMASTER (RET.): Right.
2852,Article 2852,"Well, I write in the book, Margaret, about this dissonance that Donald Trump carries with him, these opposing ideas that sometimes he finds it difficult to reconcile. And that's why I think it's important that he has a competent team around him to help him identify his own agenda."
2853,Article 2853,"I mean, the story in ""At War With Ourselves"" is in large measure my effort to guard his independence of judgment, because, in any administration, there are people who try to manipulate a president into decisions. They don't want to give a president options."
2854,Article 2854,"What my experience was during that first year and a period in which we put into place a lot of these big shifts in policy is, if you give him best analysis, if you give him multiple options, it's in the comparison of those options that he can consider the long-term costs and consequences and make sound decisions."
2855,Article 2855,"Also in the book, though, Margaret, I write about at times he finds it tough to stick with those decisions…"
2856,Article 2856,MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.

2861,Article 2861,MARGARET BRENNAN: … had happened on the soil of a U.S. ally by Russia.

2863,Article 2863,"MARGARET BRENNAN: When you got home, you said to your wife: ""After a year in this job, I cannot understand Putin's hold on Trump."""
2864,Article 2864,LT. GEN. H.R. MCMASTER (RET.): Yes.
2865,Article 2865,MARGARET BRENNAN: How do you explain that now?
2866,Article 2866,"LT. GEN. H.R. MCMASTER (RET.): Well, I explained it in the book."
2867,Article 2867,"I try to place the president's belief that he could have a good deal with Vladimir Putin in context of the two previous presidents who thought that they could have a good deal with Putin. But, also, President Trump – and people know this – he likes big, splashy deals."
2868,Article 2868,He liked – he was pursuing that with Putin. He was pursuing that with Xi Jinping.
2869,Article 2869,MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.
2870,Article 2870,"LT. GEN. H.R. MCMASTER (RET.): And, of course, Putin is the best liar in the world."
2871,Article 2871,"And so I struggled, Margaret, should I write about how Putin tried to manipulate President Trump or not? And I thought, well, Putin knows how he was trying to do it, so maybe, in writing about how Putin was trying to press Donald Trump's buttons, that will make a future President Trump, if he's elected, less susceptible to those kind of tactics."
2872,Article 2872,"MARGARET BRENNAN: Because he, on the campaign trail, argues these counterfactuals, that Putin was afraid of him, that Putin wouldn't have invaded Ukraine if he had been president."
2873,Article 2873,"LT. GEN. H.R. MCMASTER (RET.): Well, he has a point in a couple of areas."
2874,Article 2874,"In that first year of the Trump administration, I tell the story of how we imposed more sanctions on Russian entities in that one year than the previous eight years of the Obama administration."
2875,Article 2875,MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.
2876,Article 2876,"LT. GEN. H.R. MCMASTER (RET.): And the really critical decision, though, Margaret, I think, was to provide the Ukrainians with defensive capabilities, especially in the form of Javelin missiles."
2877,Article 2877,MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.
2878,Article 2878,"LT. GEN. H.R. MCMASTER (RET.): But in the area of inconsistency, I also tell the story about how that support was suspended to get evidence of the Biden family's corrupt activities in Ukraine."
2879,Article 2879,MARGARET BRENNAN: The grounds for impeachment…
2880,Article 2880,"LT. GEN. H.R. MCMASTER (RET.): Right, absolutely."
2881,Article 2881,MARGARET BRENNAN: … which basically you're saying were justified.
2882,Article 2882,LT. GEN. H.R. MCMASTER (RET.): Right. So there is…
2883,Article 2883,MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.
2884,Article 2884,LT. GEN. H.R. MCMASTER (RET.): There's an element in the story about how he can make really sound decisions and disrupt things that need to be disrupted in terms of foreign policy and national security…
2885,Article 2885,MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.
2886,Article 2886,LT. GEN. H.R. MCMASTER (RET.): … but oftentimes struggles to hang on to those decisions and see them through.
2887,Article 2887,"MARGARET BRENNAN: H.R. McMaster, thank you. It's an interesting read."
2888,Article 2888,"LT. GEN. H.R. MCMASTER (RET.): Thanks, Margaret. Thank you, Margaret."
2889,Article 2889,MARGARET BRENNAN: We will be right back.

2892,Article 2892,"Good morning to you, Congresswoman."
2893,Article 2893,REPRESENTATIVE SUMMER LEE (D-Pennsylvania): Good morning.
2894,Article 2894,"MARGARET BRENNAN: Our CBS polling shows that a majority of Americans, 59 percent of them, think the U.S. should encourage Israel to stop or decrease its military actions in Gaza."
2895,Article 2895,At the Democratic Convention. Vice President Harris received loud applause for these remarks:
2896,Article 2896,(Begin VT)
2897,Article 2897,"KAMALA HARRIS (Vice President of the United States (D) and U.S. Presidential Candidate): President Biden and I are working to end this war such that Israel is secure, the hostages are released, the suffering in Gaza ends, and the Palestinian people can realize their right to dignity, security, freedom and self-determination."
2898,Article 2898,(CHEERING)
2899,Article 2899,(APPLAUSE)
2900,Article 2900,(End VT)
2901,Article 2901,MARGARET BRENNAN: Now that is largely just restating existing U.S. policy.
2902,Article 2902,Do you think that's sufficient outreach to those who felt the administration hasn't expressed empathy?
2903,Article 2903,"REPRESENTATIVE SUMMER LEE: You know, I think that – you know, I think people who are experiencing this, right, who are – who are outside of the arena, who have been organizing since October, you know, that is a step."
2904,Article 2904,"But I think that what they really were asking for was a – of course, the opportunity to speak for themselves. I think that, like all people, when you are experiencing something, you want to be able to tell your own story. And a lot of the people who are Palestinian, Palestinian-American, Arabs and Muslims were asking for that opportunity."
2905,Article 2905,"So while, you know, we all obviously believe that there should be a cease- fire immediately and permanently, and that Palestinians, just like Israelis, deserve the right to self-determination, we have to do more than just say that we believe that. We have to actually take steps that are going to evidence that, take steps that are going to show that we're willing to start to listen to people who have been outside of the political, I would say, conversation for so long."
2906,Article 2906,"It's been a third rail. And there's going to be a lot more work that we have to do to show to this demographic that the Democratic Party is – includes them in its big tent, includes them in our foreign policy considerations, and also includes them in our conversations around humanity and human rights."
2907,Article 2907,MARGARET BRENNAN: You're talking about the decision at the DNC to deny anyone from the Uncommitted Movement or Palestinian-American to take the stage.
2908,Article 2908,"Congressman Ro Khanna tweeted: ""It was a tragic mistake, perpetuating the erasure of the Palestinian story and voice."""
2909,Article 2909,"Why do you think Democratic leaders resisted it, and is it a self-inflicted wound?"
2910,Article 2910,"REPRESENTATIVE SUMMER LEE: I think that there has been – and I think that, if you really look at this, long before October 7, it was almost taboo to talk about Palestinians, to talk about the experiences that they have and that they continue to have in our politics."
2911,Article 2911,"And I think that this was a continuation of it. To put on stage – first of all, I think it's important that we recognize that even the way we talk about the movement is in a way that sometimes is a little wide – it's broad."
2912,Article 2912,MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.
2913,Article 2913,REPRESENTATIVE SUMMER LEE: It doesn't always take into account what folks are arguing about.
2914,Article 2914,"I think that, whether it's the Black lives movement or the movement for Palestinian rights, there's always this rush to say that their movement, the ways that they protest, the tactics, the strategies are inconvenient. And I think that that's just the way that we've done it, especially when we're nervous about a presidential election that we all know is incredibly important."
2915,Article 2915,"Defeating Trump is the top concern, but we can do that, and we can also give space, create space for people, voices that are marginalized. We missed an opportunity to do that here. And in doing so, what we are essentially saying is that every Palestinian thinks the exact same way, that all folks who are protesting who are voicing their concerns are one group, and not individuals, not all folks who are coming with different perspectives."
2916,Article 2916,I think that there was room and space to say that…
2917,Article 2917,MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.
2918,Article 2918,REPRESENTATIVE SUMMER LEE: … there is room in the Democratic Party for that particular perspective as well.
2919,Article 2919,"MARGARET BRENNAN: This was a historic nomination of Vice President Harris as the first black, first South Asian nominee of a major party."
2920,Article 2920,She's chosen really not to talk about the historic nature of that. Do you think that she should?
2921,Article 2921,REPRESENTATIVE SUMMER LEE: I think that it speaks for itself.
2922,Article 2922,"You know, I think that there is, you know, zero chance that folks all across America do not recognize that she would be the first Black woman, the first South Asian woman in person, to be not just our party's nominee, but hopefully our president."
2923,Article 2923,"So, to talk about it, it's almost a filler. I think that what's – I think that what they're doing and what they should be doing is talking about the issues…"
2924,Article 2924,MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.
2925,Article 2925,REPRESENTATIVE SUMMER LEE: … talking about the things that not…
2926,Article 2926,MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.
2927,Article 2927,"REPRESENTATIVE SUMMER LEE: … are not just unique to women, black women, Asian women…"
2928,Article 2928,MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.
2929,Article 2929,REPRESENTATIVE SUMMER LEE: … but actually the things that make her qualified for the job…
2930,Article 2930,MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.
2931,Article 2931,"REPRESENTATIVE SUMMER LEE: … her – her resume, the policies that that bring Democrats to – to vote…"
2932,Article 2932,"MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes, let's – let's talk about those things…"
2933,Article 2933,"REPRESENTATIVE SUMMER LEE: … you know, on November 5. Those are things that we're going to need to focus on. We all know there's history here."
2934,Article 2934,"MARGARET BRENNAN: Congresswoman, let's talk about those things on the other side of this next break."
2935,Article 2935,Stay with us.
2936,Article 2936,(ANNOUNCEMENTS)
2937,Article 2937,"MARGARET BRENNAN: Just ahead, we talk to former FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb, as well as New York Congressman Pat Ryan, and Oklahoma Republican Governor Kevin Stitt."
2938,Article 2938,"So, stay with us."
2939,Article 2939,(ANNOUNCEMENTS)
2940,Article 2940,MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION.
2941,Article 2941,We're continuing our conversation now with Congresswoman Summer Lee of Pennsylvania.
2942,Article 2942,"Congresswoman, you were talking before the break about the need to focus on issues for - for the campaign. This past week former Speaker Pelosi stated Vice President Harris will, quote, ""have to govern from the center because that's where the public is."""
2943,Article 2943,"I know you are a progressive Democrat. Do you think that this pivot to the center, particularly on issues like the border and immigration and crime, are they going to hurt support for the Harris-Walz ticket or is it - what's required?"
2944,Article 2944,"REPRESENTATIVE SUMMER LEE (D-PA): Yes. So, I have to say, and I - and I like to hope that we're able to do this. I have to - I have to disagree a bit. I think that we have data, we have polling, we have anecdotal evidence from American – Americans all over the country, but especially out in Pennsylvania, in a swing state, where we're not actually asking for our - our candidates to run away from progressive ideals. We're asking them for - for them to run to them."
2945,Article 2945,"You know, there's this idea that to say that, you know, having health care or an equitable education or even talking about, you know, immigration reform and the border in a humane way is somehow to the left. But I think that that's what the average American wants. And I think that in too many - in very many ways we've ceded ground to Republicans, especially around immigration. They have the tendency of talking about it in incredibly fear mongering and inhumane way. And I don't think that it's wise that we join them in that. I think people want to see us distinguish ourselves as a party. I think they want to see that we offer solutions for working class people, for marginalized people. And I think that we can do that vocally and proudly and still bring people to the party and not have them run away from it."
2946,Article 2946,"MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. So, that means you disagree with the Harris endorsement of the bipartisan border bill, which was a fairly conservative bill, and that's the policy stated for what the vice president would enact if she's elected?"
2947,Article 2947,"REPRESENTATIVE SUMMER LEE: I think that what I'd like to hope - I hope that - what I think so many of us want to see, and not just progressives, I mean even just Democrats, is that we can recognize that we need comprehensive immigration reform. That there are millions of folks in America who are impacted by this. Folks who want to come here for a better life. Who are looking for opportunities. And they are finding that the pathway, the window to achieving those opportunities is shutting, not opening."
2948,Article 2948,"We know that in the past there were systems in place that - that created a - an easier pathway for folks to obtain citizenship, for folks to work, for folks to contribute. And that's what people want now. And I think that we need to be real about the solutions, what's driving folks to our border."
2949,Article 2949,MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.
2950,Article 2950,REPRESENTATIVE SUMMER LEE: And what's driving folks to want to make a life here in the United States at the same time.
2951,Article 2951,"MARGARET BRENNAN: All right, Congresswoman Lee, thank you for your perspective."
2952,Article 2952,"For a slightly different one from a fellow Democrat, we are joined now by New York Congressman Pat Ryan."
2953,Article 2953,Good morning.
2954,Article 2954,"REPRESENTATIVE PAT RYAN (D-NY): Hey, how are you doing, Margaret?"
2955,Article 2955,MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm doing well.
2956,Article 2956,"You know, you were at the DNC this week speaking on stage. You were one of the very first House Democrats to call out and publicly say Joe Biden needed to pass the torch."
2957,Article 2957,"You're in a tight re-election race in - in Hudson Valley, New York. Do you think that having Kamala Harris at the top of the ticket makes it easier for you to win than if Joe Biden had stayed?"
2958,Article 2958,"REPRESENTATIVE PAT RYAN: Without question. I mean, coming out of the DNC, and - and for the last now month plus we have just seen such energy, such enthusiasm, such true joy and optimism at a time when even, this morning in your coverage, it's a challenging, dark and divided time. And that's what people in my district are - are desperate for. That - that is what we've been working on."
2959,Article 2959,"When Kamala Harris talks about freedom, patriotism, reproductive freedom, economic freedom, freedom to breathe clean air and water, that is what folks, regardless of party, they want to believe in something, to be for something. And she has delivered that. And I think over the next 72 days we're going to see that momentum continue to build."
2960,Article 2960,MARGARET BRENNAN: The former speaker points to five seats in New York state as determining the difference between Democrats having a minority or majority spot in Congress. You are one of those seats. Do you think that now Democrats have a better shot at gaining the majority?
2961,Article 2961,"REPRESENTATIVE PAT RYAN: Yes, no doubt."
2962,Article 2962,MARGARET BRENNAN: Definitely?
2963,Article 2963,"REPRESENTATIVE PAT RYAN: No doubt. It's just been a sea change. I mean, I won my last race by 1.3 percent."
2964,Article 2964,MARGARET BRENNAN: Exactly.
2965,Article 2965,"REPRESENTATIVE PAT RYAN: Very attune to what's happening in my district and talking to folks all day, every day. It has been just kind of putting rocket fuel into a jet engine and seeing blast off. It's such - it's so important, I think, to understand, it's one thing to be against a set of things -"
2966,Article 2966,MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.
2967,Article 2967,"REPRESENTATIVE PAT RYAN: But - but to be for a set of things and a set - and for core freedoms, that is - that's rallying people."
2968,Article 2968,"MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, so then let's put this in specific terms because some of the policies aren't that different from Joe Biden's policies. In fact, they're exactly the same on - on the border. And you, when you issued that statement calling for Biden to step aside, you called for him to restore order at the border. Your district has been hit with a lot of migrants being sent from New York City up to the Hudson Valley. What is any different about the Harris platform on the border?"
2969,Article 2969,"REPRESENTATIVE PAT RYAN: I served 27 months in combat. I know what it means to secure a border. And I think foundational to the responsibilities of a nation state is to secure the border. That - that's not a partisan thing, that's a widely held view. So, I - I did, you know, call on and sort of call out President Biden in not doing enough. They've - they've - they've -"
2970,Article 2970,MARGARET BRENNAN: But that was the Biden-Harris policy.
2971,Article 2971,"REPRESENTATIVE PAT RYAN: They've stepped up. And wat we heard from Vice President Harris at the convention, in her speech, was exactly what folks in my district want to hear, which is, we're going to secure the border, restore order at the border, but not lose who we are as Americans to welcome folks that want to come here, make a better life, serve our country, make it better and stronger. We can do both. We will do both."
2972,Article 2972,"MARGARET BRENNAN: So, but it's still not articulated as a different policy in the specifics. We haven't heard the vice president at least say things in detail."
2973,Article 2973,"But on the issue of abortion, which is already protected in New York state up to 24 weeks, after that point it has to be that the mother's life is at risk for that procedure to be taken, but it's going to be on the ballot in some form or fashion in November. Do you think that this is just about driving up turnout?"
2974,Article 2974,REPRESENTATIVE PAT RYAN: The whole founding -
2975,Article 2975,MARGARET BRENNAN: It's already protected (INAUDIBLE).
2976,Article 2976,REPRESENTATIVE PAT RYAN: The whole founding ideology of our country is about freedom. People don't forget that just two years ago the - Trump's appointees to the Supreme Court ripped away a fundamental freedom. There have been more states across the country now taking away American freedoms.
2977,Article 2977,"You want to piss off the American people, take their freedom away."
2978,Article 2978,And so this is - this is not like a political thing again. This gets to the core of who we are.
2979,Article 2979,"And so in New York, things like the Comstock Act that are on the books, outlined in Project 2025, even without congressional action, the Trump - hypothetical Trump administration says they can put in place essentially a backdoor national abortion ban. We are stand ug up against that, as Democrats, really as Americans though. And that will be a huge issue in my district."
2980,Article 2980,MARGARET BRENNAN: Trump and Vance haven't been very clear on the Comstock Act. I asked vice - I asked J.D. Vance a lot of questions about it just a few weeks ago.
2981,Article 2981,"Just to put that aside, though, I want to ask you about Afghanistan, because in your - in your call for Joe Biden to step aside, you also pointed to that as a Biden-Harris problem. In fact, you said it was a strategic and a moral failure, that withdraw. The vice president says she was that last person in the room on that decision. Is that failure also hers?"
2982,Article 2982,REPRESENTATIVE PAT RYAN: We've got to stop assigning partisan blame on fundamental things like our national security.
2983,Article 2983,MARGARET BRENNAN: You said that.
2984,Article 2984,"REPRESENTATIVE PAT RYAN: I - I said it as an American. I said it as someone who served in combat, who had friends that served in Afghanistan. If we can't make mistakes and - and wrestle with that, with a little bit of space to do better in the future, how do we expect to continue on the next 250 years as this great country that we are?"
2985,Article 2985,"So, we have to be - and I've called on presidents of both parties when I disagree with them, on behalf of my constituents, on behalf of what I think is right for the country. So, we have to be able to do that."
2986,Article 2986,MARGARET BRENNAN: I bring that up because we are coming up on the three- year anniversary of that withdraw and that fatal attack at Abbey Gate where 13 service people lost their lives in the ISIS-k suicide bombing. The family members of some of those service people took the stage at the RNC and said that President Biden hasn't spoken their names and how hurtful that was to them.
2987,Article 2987,Do you think the vice president should speak to that now this week?
2988,Article 2988,"REPRESENTATIVE PAT RYAN: Well, I'll let the vice president make her decisions about things like that. What I do think we need to recognize is, you want to talk about how we're speaking to veterans and military families. Just ten days ago Donald Trump got up and said, Medal of Honor recipients, the most revered hero's in our country's history, there's only 62 living Medal of Honor recipients in the United States, he directly denigrated and insulted them, on top of years of insulting gold star families, calling our troops suckers and losers. That's something I spoke about at the convention."
2989,Article 2989,"And I believe we're in a place where the Democratic Party is a party of patriots. Folks voting for Kamala Harris can feel that they are doing - and I certainly feel - their patriotic duty to bring our country together, stop insulting veterans and military families that have made the ultimate sacrifice. And Kamala Harris has done that and - and will continue to do that."
2990,Article 2990,MARGARET BRENNAN: But it would mean something to those in your district if that loss was acknowledged this week?
2991,Article 2991,"REPRESENTATIVE PAT RYAN: Wel, I think that it would mean a lot to the family members, of course, to acknowledge their - their loss."
2992,Article 2992,MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.
2993,Article 2993,"REPRESENTATIVE PAT RYAN: And, you know, we've lost far too many veterans, not just in active duty combat -"
2994,Article 2994,MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.
2995,Article 2995,"REPRESENTATIVE PAT RYAN: But we've talked about this before, coming home. We've now lost more Iraq and Afghanistan veterans to suicide than we lost in active duty."
2996,Article 2996,MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.
2997,Article 2997,"REPRESENTATIVE PAT RYAN: So, we need to properly fund the VA. Another thing that Donald Trump failed to do."
2998,Article 2998,MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.
2999,Article 2999,"REPRESENTATIVE PAT RYAN: And so it's a - these are important, stark choices ahead."
3000,Article 3000,"MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman - Congressman, good to have you here."
