Yes, there WAS good news coming out of 2020

Correspondent David Pogue reminds us of some of the often-overshadowed bright spots of the past year.

2020 will not be remembered as a big year for good news. But science and technology actually scored a few triumphs – beginning with the piece of software that made it possible for meetings, classes, relationships, and performances to carry on.

I'm referring, of course, to Zoom video calls, like the one I had with my 92-year-old dad, Cleveland lawyer Dick Pogue.

"Hello, Dave!"

"So, am I correct that you had never used Zoom until the lockdown began?"


"Absolutely not. I was amazed when I first saw it."

"Apple, Google and Microsoft all had their own similar video programs. Why do you think Zoom became the winner of the pandemic?" David asked.

"I think it's the simplicity of getting into the meeting."

All the Zoom meetings meant fewer people flying, and all the closed offices meant fewer people driving. It's not the kind of economy anybody wants, of course, but it did lead to some more good news:


For the first time in a century, you could hear birdsong in the cities; you could see fish in the canals of Venice; and you could see blue skies in L.A.!

At one point, global greenhouse gas emissions fell 17 percent, the biggest drop in human history.

This was also the year that the plastic pollution problem finally got the world's attention. We've dumping the equivalent of a truck-load's worth of plastic into the ocean every minute of every day.

China joined more than 125 other countries that have banned or taxed single-use plastic or plastic bags.

But you don't have to be a government to make a difference.

Ordinary citizen Sheila Morovati was fed up with the more than 40 billion plastic utensils that restaurants include with take-out orders every year that nobody uses.

Pogue asked, "So, if I take it out of the takeout bag and throw it in the trash, that's not single-use plastic?"


"That's zero-use plastic!" she replied.

Moravati undertook a one-woman campaign to persuade delivery services like Uber Eats and Postmates to make those utensils optional. "Uber Eats and Postmates now have a checkbox that says, 'If you would like plastic cutlery, click here.'" 

2020 was also an astonishing year for space. NASA launched its most advanced rover yet to Mars; landed a spacecraft on an asteroid; and, for the first time since the Space Shuttle retired in 2011, flew American astronauts to the International Space Station on an American spacecraft made by SpaceX - twice.

Finally, 2020 ended with the best piece of news science could possibly have offered us: Vaccines for the disease that ruined the year in the first place.

Pogue asked, "Vaccines typically take years to develop – I mean, five, ten years. How was it possible that this one was developed so fast?"

"This was really born of a great deal of cooperation between academics, industry and government," said Pfizer's head of vaccine development Bill Gruber, "to essentially recognize this as the highest priority. One key element is that, as opposed to work typically being done in sequence, a great deal of work has been done in parallel."

The vaccines hold the promise that this time next year, good news will be a lot easier to find.  At least that's what Pogue's dad thinks.


David asked, "Do you have any broader thoughts about the year 2020?"

"I'll be glad when 2020's gone," Dick replied. "This was a bad year. But next year has got to be better, much better!"

Google's top trending search queries for 2020 highlight one of the strangest years of all time
moneywatch
By Dan Patterson

Updated on: December 9, 2020 / 3:10 PM EST / MoneyWatch

The COVID-19 pandemic, protests, wildfires and a high-stakes presidential election: 2020 was one chaotic year, and a surge of people turned to Google for answers. Now the search giant has released the Year in Search, its annual snapshot of the year's most important search terms, news stories, entertainers and politicians.

To create the annual list Google aggregates trillions — yes, trillions — of queries over the course of the year, filters out junk data like duplicate queries, then tabulates a list reflecting the events the company says most defined the year. To identify trends, Google's algorithm looks for the percentage increase in searches for a term over a period of time, relative to other searches.

This year, searches for "election results" topped the list, and searches related to "coronavirus" were ubiquitous across categories. "Kobe Bryant," "Joe Biden" and "stimulus checks" were also widely searched search terms.

"One thing that has been incredible to see in the data is the unprecedented shifts in people's information needs," said Google's data editor, Simon Rogers. For example, Google launched a COVID-19 news page when its internal trend tracking tools flagged a spike in searches related to coronavirus. 

Instead of presenting a traditional page with search results, searches related to COVID-19 display timely and accurate information from vetted medical sources, like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, World Health Organization and local news sources. 

"We worked with partners at the international, national and even local levels to connect people with the critical info," Rogers explained. The page also used public data sources to display updated information like COVID-19 statistics in Google Maps.

There were other atypical trends this year, Rogers said. The most interesting topics reflected how people adjusted to "a new normal. Queries about "Dalgona coffee," a popular comfort-food trend on social network TikTok, and "banana bread recipes" hit an all-time high, and questions about how to cut your own hair remained popular all year. "Fires near me" and "earthquake near me" were two of the top trending local queries this year.

This year marks the 20th anniversary of Google's Year in Search. "Nostradamus," "osama bin laden" and "eminem" were the top queries when the list launched in 2001. At the time, the zeitgeist nature of the list was intended to demonstrate the scope of the fledgling startup's search technology and user base and to differentiate Google in a once-crowded search-engine market, which included competitors like Yahoo!, AskJeeves and Inktomi.

When the list launched it was just one simple webpage with a few subcategories. Today Google publishes hundreds of "trending" categories in multiple languages.

Here are some of Google's top trending search queries for 2020:

Entertainment
The 10 best films of 2020
By David Morgan

December 30, 2020 / 11:18 AM EST / CBS News

In cinema terms, 2020 is an asterisk year, at best. It was certainly not a great year for film — choked in production, constrained and starved in exhibition, and forced to be viewed through the prism of a global crisis that completely alters our reading of the movies and their messages. Most every film released this year was written, shot and edited before anyone had heard of the coronavirus, so their stories pretty much exist in a world that feels divorced from our current lives — escapism taken to the nth degree.

Still, of those films whose releases weren't postponed to 2021 A.V. (After Vaccine), there was a choice selection of movies worthy of a Ten Best Films list — and, thankfully, one great film that, pandemic or no, seems to exist outside of time.

1. "First Cow"
Directed by Kelly Reichardt.

Two enterprising young men in the Oregon Territory of 1820 conspire to steal milk from the first cow brought into the region, in order to sell their tasty biscuits at the muddy trading post that stands in for civilization. Masterfully directed by Kelly Reichardt, "First Cow" is a primal drama of the American dream, and of people living on the periphery of wilderness, who would — in one fashion or another — help define a young nation's character.

John Magaro's tender, inviting performance as Cookie, working his way west in hopes of finding his place in the world, pulls us into the character's conflict with his own sense of shame. How far can he push himself beyond what would be considered the limits of acceptable behavior east of the Mississippi, when encouraged by Orion Lee's entrancing King-Lu, a personification of an American West opening its doors of opportunity to anyone with the brazenness and guts to enter? You feel Cookie's despoilment, and realize there can be no retreat, only a shared sense of commitment owing to their friendship.


And don't be fooled by the film's opening scene: The first several minutes are this gifted director's very effective and haunting demonstration of the impermeable fabric of time, and how some of its mysteries can never, ever be resolved by us.

"First Cow" was selected as the year's best film by the New York Film Critics Circle.

"First Cow" is currently available via Video on Demand and on Showtime. 

2. "Nomadland"
Directed by Chloé Zhao.

In her followup to her 2017 film "The Rider," director Chloé Zhao again blurs fiction and non-fiction, in a story inspired by journalist Jessica Bruder's book "Nomadland," an account of nomadic van dwellers eking out a life amid the fallout of the 2008 economic crash.

Frances McDormand stars as Fern, a widow who shuttles from state to state, job to job, living an itinerate life among other nomadic seniors whose quasi-retirement resides on a razor's edge between personal fulfillment on their own terms, and despair.

The direction by Zhao (which was honored as the year's best by both the New York and Los Angeles critics) is finely attuned to those on the margins, with a cast that includes some of the real-life people documented in Bruder's book.

To watch a trailer for "Nomadland" click on the player below:


NOMADLAND | Official Trailer | Searchlight Pictures by SearchlightPictures on YouTube
After its debut at the Venice, Toronto and New York film festivals and a brief streaming run earlier this month, "Nomadland" will be released on February 19, 2021.   


3. "Never Rarely Sometimes Always"
Directed by Eliza Hittman.

An abused teenage girl in Pennsylvania named Autumn (Sidney Flanigan), who discovers she is pregnant, tries to induce a miscarriage but fails. She then travels, accompanied by a cousin, Skylar (Talia Ryder), to New York City, where she hopes she can obtain an abortion without requiring parental consent.

The film's trim execution, and Flanigan's almost naive reactions to the life changes she undergoes and the choices she must make, as well as Ryder's machinations when she discovers they are short on cash, dramatize the kind of shared experience that these young people will likely keep as a buried secret forever.

In this scene, as she is questioned by a counselor, the vulnerability of Autumn becomes almost excruciating and saddening to watch:

Flanigan and Hittman were both honored by the New York Film Critics Circle, for Best Actress and Best Screenplay, respectively.

"Never Rarely Sometimes Always" is available via Video on Demand. 

4. "76 Days" (China)
Directed by Weixi Chen, Hao Wu, and Anonymous.


From the start, this documentary of frontline health workers in Wuhan Province, China, at the beginning of the coronavirus epidemic is eye-opening — from a hospital employee's heart-wrenching pleas to be with her dying father, to the emotional turmoil of parceling out care to patients. The camerawork puts the viewer directly into ground zero of the virus, and the maelstrom of fear and ignorance about what halting the outbreak entails.

While many viewers may have become numb to the hell that medical professionals have experienced this year as the pandemic worsened, this film's bare-bones immediacy capturing the start of the outbreak reminds us how the lack of information made this new virus even more unnerving.

The most chilling scene in any movie this year records the sad accumulation of the victims' smartphones, bagged and waiting to be disinfected, which ring and vibrate with voicemail messages to the dead.

In this scene, medical staff must contend with a crush of patients in the waiting room trying to force their way into the hospital:

"76 Days" is available to rent via Virtual Cinema screenings. 

5. "Beanpole" (Russia)
Directed by Kantemir Balagov.

The deprivations of Leningrad following the end of World War II are portrayed with a grim starkness in this heartwrenching drama — named Best Foreign Language Film by the Los Angeles Film Critics Association — in which two women are joined both by their shared experiences of war, and by a terrible personal tragedy.


The friendship between the statuesque nurse Iya, a.k.a. "Beanpole" (Viktoria Miroshnichenko) and Masha (Vasilisa Perelygina), who has returned home from the front, is the focal point in this story of survivors, barely, who try and fail to resurrect the life they had before the war, and instead must pick up the pieces from a worldwide trauma. Both of these first-time actresses are terrific.

In this scene, Masha tries on a dressmaker's frock, and in a shock of color gets to experience a pleasure that years of war have muted:

"Beanpole" is available to rent via Virtual Cinema screenings. 

6. "Ma Rainey's Black Bottom"
Directed by George C. Wolfe.

Viola Davis and Chadwick Boseman lead a strong cast in this enthralling adaptation of August Wilson's play, about a 1920s blues diva and her backup musicians trying to get through a recording session.

The film is opened up slightly from the stage, but not enough to overwhelm or dilute this very intimate character drama. If anything, the new scenes give depth to the discourse about racial injustice, exploitation, and cultural appropriation. But they also give added excuses for music, which is appreciated.

In his last film appearance, Boseman is strong as the cocksure trumpeter Levee, whose brash attitude masks deeper insecurities and a propensity for violence. He and Glynn Turman were named Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor by the Los Angeles Film Critics Association. Davis (who won a Best Supporting Actress Oscar for another Wilson adaptation, "Fences") is terrific as the imperial Ma Rainey, whom you never want to make wait for her cold Coca-Cola.


In this scene, Levee confronts his fellow band members Cutler (Colman Domingo), Toledo (Turman) and Slow Drag (Michael Potts) about how to work with Whites in the music industry:

"Ma Rainey's Black Bottom" is currently streaming on Netflix. 

7. "Wolfwalkers" (Ireland)
Directed by Tomm Moore and Ross Stewart.

The filmmakers behind the 2009 animated movie "The Secret of Kells" return with this ornately decorated fable of a creature — half wolf, half human — and her friendship with the daughter of a huntsman ordered to kill all the wolves in a nearby forest.

This story of love and loyalties tested, mixed with humor, myth, and overtones of politics, make this a memorable, visual treat.

"Wolfwalkers" was named the year's best animated feature by both the New York Film Critics Circle and the Los Angeles Film Critics Association.

8. "Sound of Metal"
Directed by Darius Marder.

Riz Ahmed gives a haunting performance as Ruben, a musician whose loss of hearing precludes his loss of identity. As he struggles to accept that his hearing may not be recoverable, he risks alienating both the community of deaf who seek to help him, and his singer-girlfriend whose career, he believes, may be compromised by his disability.

Director Darius Marder, who collaborated with Abraham Marder and Derek Cianfrance ("The Place Beyond the Pines," "Blue Valentine") on the story and screenplay, is extremely creative in dramatizing the auditory imbalance that Ruben experiences as his ears fail him more and more.

In this scene Ruben goes for a hearing test, grasping to understand what is being said:


Sound of Metal Clip 1 / Filmfest Hamburg by Filmfest Hamburg on YouTube
"Sound of Metal" is currently streaming via Amazon Prime Video.

9. "Soul"
Directed by Pete Docter; co-directed by Kemp Powers.

With such recent successes as "Inside Out" (which explored the makeup of personalities), "Ratatouille" (sensory delight) and "Coco" (travels to the afterlife), the Pixar animation studio returns to familiar territory for a story that pulls from all three. While "Soul" seems similar, it has a bracing and inventive narrative, about a middle-school music teacher, Joe (voiced by Jamie Foxx), who dreams of a successful jazz career. When Joe has an accident on the very day of his most promising gig, his soul leaves his body, and is desperate to find a way back.


Being a Pixar film, "Soul" is filled with humor and wondrous production and character design, in this case representing a dimension where new souls acquire their personalities before they are shipped off to Earth. There is also blissful music, from the score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross ("The Social Network") to the jazz compositions and arrangements by Jon Batiste.

In this scene Joe is introduced to a new soul, 22 (Tina Fey), who isn't ready for transit to Earth (and, we dare say, Earth may not be ready for 22):


SOUL | Twenty Two Clip | Official Disney & Pixar UK by Disney UK on YouTube
"Soul" is available to stream via Disney+.

10. "Lovers Rock" (U.K.)
Directed by Steve McQueen.

This short feature (packaged by Amazon as part of a series of films by McQueen, titled "Small Axe") recreates the atmosphere of a 1980 house party of West Indian immigrants in London. We see the preparations, almost smell the food cooking, and witness as men and women congregate, dance, and enjoy reggae music — and each other.

There is no real script per se, and the characters do not cut deep, but there is a tactile feel for the period, through the clothes, music and décor, expertly captured by cinematographer Shabier Kirchner, while the male-female tensions are timeless.

To watch a trailer for "Lovers Rock" click on the video player below:


Small Axe | Lovers Rock Trailer | Prime Video by Amazon Prime Video on YouTube
"Lovers Rock" is available to stream via Amazon Prime Video.


Special mention: "Hamilton"
Directed by Thomas Kail.

This stunning recording of the Broadway stage sensation was slated to have a theatrical release in 2021. But when the pandemic shuttered movie theaters — and postponed the summer release of the film version of Lin-Manuel Miranda's "In the Heights" — "Hamilton" was instead streamed on the Disney+ channel.

Having the revolutionary musical on our home screens, while reductive, made the story of the founding father more intimate, and the closeups of the actors capture their artistry in all its grandeur. At least, you didn't have to hope for a lottery win to score tickets to be in the room where it happens.

Clip: "The Room Where It Happens" featuring Tony Award-winner Leslie Odom Jr. as Aaron Burr.


"The Room Where It Happens" Official Clip 2 | Hamilton | Disney+ by Walt Disney Studios on YouTube
But "Hamilton" also prompts a discussion of what exactly a movie is nowadays. With cinemas closed and many productions released straight to video-on-demand, what separates a "film" from the "content" that clogs our scrolling Netflix feed is becoming increasingly blurred. While the preferred method to watch a film will always be to gaze up at images projected on a giant blank wall, where you can give yourself over to the story without distraction, a laptop will have to do if you don't want to chance spreading the infection to yourself or others. No movie (not even the Imax-sized "Tenet") is worth that risk.

With regard to "Hamilton," there is little in the way of adaptation to a standard movie musical format, as Hollywood typically does; rather, it preserves the original Broadway cast, staging and costumes, as contained on the stage of the Richard Rodgers Theatre, for which future generations can be grateful. But just as the show was a touchstone in musical theater, perhaps this recording of "Hamilton" will become a touchstone in a new kind of filmed performance, with no allegiance to realism or naturalism (as we have come to expect from movies, even fantastical ones). True, "First Cow" and "Nomadland" would be nowhere if they didn't travel where they did, but do we always need all the world as a stage, when you have ... a stage?

The air got cleaner in 2020, thanks to the pandemic
By Jeff Berardelli

November 19, 2020 / 4:40 PM EST / CBS News


The global pandemic has changed the way people live and work: fewer miles on the road commuting and in the air traveling, and a reduction in industry. The result? Cleaner air, with less haze and heat-trapping greenhouse gases, according to one report. 

The U.S. is on track to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels by more than 9% in 2020 compared with last year, according to research firm BloombergNEF. The last time yearly emissions were this low was 1983, nearly four decades ago. 

While the reductions were driven by a combination of decreases in various sectors, including power and industry, the largest drop was transportation, which declined 14% from 2019.

Reductions like this — if sustained — help fight climate change by trapping less heat in the atmosphere. More heat trapped leads to higher global temperatures.

But the report also contains bad news: Emissions from the historic wildfire season in the western U.S., which is partially driven by climate change, have been four times higher than the yearly average. 

acres-burned-new.png 
CBS News
That jump in wildfire activity will offset the U.S. economy-wide emissions drop by about 3%. But the U.S. should still post a 6.5% total decrease in emissions this year, according to the BloombergNEF report.


That is almost the amount that experts say society needs to reduce emissions on a global scale for each of the next 10 years to keep the worldwide increase in temperature to less than 3 degrees Fahrenheit and avoid the worst impacts of climate change.

Because the pandemic's effects will linger into 2021, the report predicts U.S. emissions will be down 5% next year compared with 2019 levels.

But a drop in emissions for a couple of years is merely a drop in the bucket. That's because greenhouse gases accumulate in the atmosphere and it is the cumulative emissions that determine how hot the planet gets and how bad the impacts of climate change become.

Although China currently contributes the most emissions, according to the report, the U.S. is responsible for almost twice the cumulative emissions of any other nation since the start of the Industrial Revolution.


The short term economic disruption caused by COVID-19 has inadvertently put the U.S. back on track to meet its commitments in the Paris Agreement, which President Donald Trump announced in 2017 he would pull the country from. 

The U.S. is the only nation to drop out, but President-elect Joe Biden has said he will take action Day One to rejoin the pact.

Once COVID-19 restrictions lift, the return of people to work and cars on the roads will make maintaining the 2020 emissions reductions needed to keep global warming below international goals. 

If the nation does rejoin the Paris Agreement, the BloombergNEF report says the U.S. will need stronger policy commitments outside of the power sector in order to hit its 2025 target. In other words, the U.S. will need to drastically reduce its dependence on fossil fuels to reach international goals.

The international community is getting an assist from renewable energy because it is now the cheapest form of energy on the planet, according to the International Energy Agency's 2020 Outlook, but experts say governments will need to implement robust policies to guide markets.

The record-shattering 2020 hurricane season, explained
By Jeff Berardelli

November 20, 2020 / 10:33 AM EST / CBS News


Like so many other aspects of 2020, the Atlantic hurricane season hurled one shocking event after another, pushing the limits of what meteorologists thought was possible. Even as longtime records were falling and meteorologists felt as though they'd seen it all, 2020 had more tricks up its sleeve.

From the total number of storms to the rapid intensification and multiple landfalls, the records set in 2020 will likely stand for quite some time. What follows is a recap of the season's most astonishing milestones with an explanation of the factors that led to the events in this unprecedented season. Some of those factors are natural occurrences, while some are the result of human impact on the climate.

Most storms in a season
So far, the 2020 Atlantic hurricane season has spawned 30 tropical storms, forcing forecasters to dig deep into the Greek alphabet for names, having run out of the assigned names in the middle of September. This breaks the former record set in 2005 of 28 named storms. A typical season only produces 12 named storms, so 2020 has already seen two and a half times more than average.

— Tomer Burg (@burgwx) November 17, 2020
And there's still time for more storms. Hurricane season officially ends November 30, but  systems can and do form in December. So we're likely to add another couple of storms to the season total before the year is out.

From the beginning there was unanimous agreement among seasonal forecasters this past spring that 2020 would be an active season, with leading climate scientist Dr. Michael Mann of Penn State publishing the most aggressive forecast, predicting up to 24 storms. What seemed like a bold prediction at the time was not nearly bold enough. 

The unanimous expectations last spring illustrate that all of the variables that portend an active season appeared to be emerging months ahead of time. In fact, they not only emerged, but overlapped with one another. Everything just came together. 

North Atlantic sea surface temperatures were, and continue to be, far above normal in the entire basin, providing high-octane fuel to developing storms. Also, the West African monsoon, which ejects tropical disturbances into the far eastern Atlantic, some of which become hurricanes, was exceptionally active this summer. 

In the main development region of the Tropical Atlantic, surface pressures are among the lowest in the historical record; low pressure equates to storminess. Lastly, there was an absence of El Niño in the Tropical Pacific. It is a well established fact that El Niño events tend to kill Atlantic hurricanes because of the strong upper-level winds (wind shear) they produce. This year El Niño's opposite developed — La Niña — yielding a calm environment with less wind shear, which helped nurture developing storms. 

Then there's the elephant in the room: human-caused climate change. 

Since 1900, Tropical Atlantic ocean temperatures have increased by 2 degrees Fahrenheit. While it's clear warmer ocean temperatures make storms stronger, there's still vigorous debate among top climate scientists on the question of whether warmer waters lead to a greater number of tropical systems. 

 "My colleagues and I feel that the jury is very much out on the topic of global tropical cyclone frequency," said Dr. Kerry Emanuel from MIT, a leading researcher on how climate change affects hurricanes. While this Atlantic season was extreme, he points out that what we see in the Atlantic Basin is not representative of the rest of the globe. "Only about 12 percent of the world's tropical cyclones occur in the Atlantic, and globally it has not been a very exceptional year."

Mann agrees, but leans towards what he feels is the more compelling research he's seen, which points to more active seasons due to warming in the Atlantic. While some studies have found the opposite — suggesting a warming climate may lead to a decrease in storm numbers — Mann believes they used models that are insufficient to resolve the full spectrum of storms, which may have led to unrealistic results. 

Mann says because of the exponential relationship between warming and evaporation, the formation of tropical systems is not linear. Instead, he says, it is "threshold like," and his view is that "a warmer world is likely to see far greater tropical cyclogenesis," referring to the formation of tropical storms.   

For tropical storms to form, sea surface temperatures need to reach about 80 degrees Fahrenheit. It would stand to reason that since global warming has pushed sea surface temperatures up by 2 degrees in the Tropical Atlantic, then that threshold would be reached more often, in more geographical locations and at both earlier and later points in the season, breeding more spin-ups.   

Most storms to rapidly strengthen
While the first half of the 2020 season included incessant storms, they were mainly weak. That changed during peak season, August through October, and especially this autumn, no doubt owing partially to the development of the Pacific La Niña and the fact that the storms developed in the Caribbean — as they typically do during the fall — where some of the hottest waters in this hemisphere reside.

Six of the last seven systems experienced rapid intensification — defined as an increase in winds of 35 mph in 24 hours. This would be unusual at any time of the year, but the fact that these were all Greek alphabet systems, having occurred so late in the season, makes it all the more remarkable.

In total, 10 systems met the criteria for rapid intensification in 2020, tying a record established in the active 1995 season. 


Even more impressive is that a record four systems "rapidly deepened" in 2020, meaning the pressure dropped more than 40 millibars in 24 hours. The two fastest pressure drops came at the tail-end of the season in November, when activity usually wanes — Hurricane Eta followed by Hurricane Iota.


Simply put, this is unprecedented. But if you dig into the data the reason is clear. The western Caribbean is already the home to the highest ocean heat content in this part of the world. But climate change is quickly boosting that heat past thresholds which were rarely reached in the past. The warmer the water, the stronger a storm can get. 

The trend is clear in the red line below, showing the quick upward trend in the number of late-season days where sea surface temperatures exceed 83 degrees Fahrenheit.


This is also supported by science. In Emanuel's 2017 paper, he finds that a storm intensifying 70 mph in the 24 hours before landfall — a feat almost accomplished by Iota — used to occur only once per century as of the late 1900s, but by later this century it will happen once every 5 to 10 years. And this 2018 paper finds that rapid intensification has increased by 4.4 mph per decade since the 1980s, meaning if a hurricane increased its winds by 40 mph per day in 1980, then it would be likely to intensify by 60 mph per day now.

Seven Category 5 storms in 5 years
Until mid-November, one check-box left unchecked this season was a Category 5 hurricane. That changed when Hurricane Iota attained winds of 160 mph. It is the most intense storm on record that late in an Atlantic hurricane season. 

In each of the last five hurricane seasons we have seen at least one Category 5 hurricane — seven of them in total. This is a significant feat considering that in the last 170 years, the National Hurricane Center estimates there have only been 37 Category 5 storms. This means the chance of any given year yielding a Category 5, historically, is only about 20%.


For the 1st time on record (since 1851), we have 5 straight years with a Category 5 #hurricane in the Atlantic.

2016: Matthew
2017: Irma/Maria
2018: Michael
2019: Dorian/Lorenzo
Now in 2020, #Iota.

It's not coincidence, it's climate change. In the past 120 years the Tropical Atlantic has warmed 2 degrees Fahrenheit. Theoretically, for every 2-degree Fahrenheit increase in ocean warming, a storm can gain almost 20 mph in peak wind speed. 

The latest research supports this trend in stronger storms. In a paper published earlier this year, NOAA's Dr. James Kossin found major hurricanes (Category 3, 4 and 5) are indeed increasing. Kossin told CBS News, "Globally, there's about a 25% greater chance now that a hurricane will be at major hurricane intensity than four decades ago. In the Atlantic there's about twice the chance."


This matters because the power and corresponding damage potential of a hurricane increases exponentially as the winds increase. In fact, 85% of the damage from all hurricanes is caused by the major hurricanes. So, if you have stronger hurricanes you are likely to have exponentially more damage.

Record U.S. landfalls
So far this season there have been 12 U.S. landfalls, shattering the old record of nine set in 2016. In what was a relentless season for people living near the Gulf of Mexico, nine of this year's landfalls happened along the U.S. Gulf Coast and five of them occurred in Louisiana.

And in what may be the most freakish of occurrences, dual hurricane landfalls occurred just miles from each other on three occasions: Laura and Delta in Louisiana, Delta and Zeta in Mexico's Yucatan, and Eta and Iota in Nicaragua. 


Where 2020 fell short
While 2020 overperformed in nearly every category, there is one surprising statistic which was not all that impressive: Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE). This is a widely used metric for meteorologists to estimate the intensity of a hurricane season because it is an aggregation of the strength and longevity of all storms.

To be sure, ACE was far above the normal season, but it fell far short of what would be expected for 30 storms. To date, the total ACE for the 2020 hurricane season is 178, nowhere near the record of 245 set in 2005. That's because 2005 also had four Category 5 hurricanes, compared to only one this year; more hurricanes overall than 2020; and longer lasting storms, too. 

The 2004 season, featuring hurricanes Charley and Ivan, had only half the number of storms of 2020 yet produced more ACE. 


So why did 2020 underperform in the ACE department? One reason is that the first half of the season produced mostly weak systems. And unlike 2005, when many of the hurricanes were long-track storms, most of the strongest storms in 2020 formed closer to land so they did not last as long. This was especially true for the end-of-season Greek alphabet named storms, many of which formed in the Caribbean and made landfall shortly thereafter. They just did not have the time to accumulate as much ACE.


While many of the records set in 2020 will likely stay in the record books for years to come, one thing is certain: As long as society continues to release heat-trapping greenhouse pollution, climate change will continue to power hurricane seasons that defy the odds. 



U.S.
U.S. to shatter record for billion-dollar climate disasters in 2020
By Jeff Berardelli

December 10, 2020 / 4:20 PM EST / CBS News


From social justice protests to politics to the pandemic, 2020 has been unprecedented in any number of ways. And although it didn't always receive top billing, the climate crisis and the extreme weather that comes along with it also escalated to levels not experienced before. The U.S. experienced major disasters like the western wildfires, a record-breaking hurricane season and the mid-summer Midwest derecho that caused extensive damage.

So far this year, NOAA's National Center for Environmental Information (NCEI) says the U.S. has been bombarded by 16 different weather and climate-related disasters with a financial toll of one billion dollars or more — tied for the most with 2011 and 2017. However, the events included in this year's count have only been tabulated through the end of September and are expected to blow past that number once the final result is released in early January.

In a webinar organized by Climate Central on Thursday, Adam Smith, the head of NCEI's Billion Dollar Weather and Climate effort, said he expects "we will shatter the previous record," far outpacing the yearly average of 6.6 such events and potentially reaching a total of 20 individual disasters each which cost a billion dollars or more. 

This is the sixth consecutive year in which the U.S. has experienced 10 or more billion-dollar weather and climate-related disasters.

Climate Central
Steve Bowen is a meteorologist and head of catastrophe insight for Aon PLC, a professional services firm focused on risk. He says these losses are escalating due to two main factors: more intense or "unusual" events, and more people and "stuff" in harm's way. 


The more intense and usual events are powered by excess heat energy being trapped in the ecosystem by greenhouse gases from the burning of fossil fuels. But Bowen says the location of where people are moving has really amplified disaster costs as well.

"Some of the fastest-growing areas of the country include parts of the Southeast, Plains, Rockies, and the West that have been historically prone to high-impact events like hurricanes, severe convective storms, flooding, and wildfires," said Bowen. "If you add more people into regions that are the most vulnerable to direct impacts from climate change-influenced events, you're setting the stage for more risk and subsequent human and physical costs."

While the frequency of these events matter, Bowen says what is more meaningful is the location and intensity of these events because that is what drives the risk. 

The most notable such events this year were the wildfires in the West, the multitude of hurricane landfalls along the Gulf Coast, and the extremely strong derecho in the Midwest. All of these were beyond modern precedent and all were in areas where population is expanding and assets are becoming more valuable.

Professor Stephen M. Strader, a severe storms meteorologist and expert on hazards and disaster at Villanova University, agrees with Bowen and says it is difficult to separate the climate hazard event and the societal exposure and vulnerability aspects of disasters. Therefore, we can't say what proportion of the increase in damage is due to climate change and what proportion is due to greater exposure, but he says  each play a vital role and are also rapidly changing. 


"Together, this is not just a recipe for disaster, it's a recipe for repetitive disasters," Strader said.

"Ignoring the effects of a changing climate, our expanding developed footprint alone is driving an uptick in hazard impact magnitude, frequency, and disaster losses," explains Strader. This expanding footprint of developed areas is something he calls the expanding bullseye — an illustration of how our population is moving into areas where greater hazards exist.

Wildfires 
According NOAA and Climate Central, the greatest damage in 2020 came from the most severe fire season on record, which doubled the typical amount of acres burned. The vast majority of wildfires happened in the western states, where California endured 5 of its 6 largest fires on record and Colorado had 3 of its 4 largest wildfires on record. Scientists blame the longer and more intense fire seasons on warming and drying due to climate change.

The American Red Cross says wildfires and hurricanes contributed to a record need for emergency shelter this year.

Hurricanes
The Atlantic hurricane season was the busiest on record with 30 named storms. Of those, a record 12 systems made landfall in the U.S. The Gulf Coast was hit by 9, shattering the previous record. While these landfalls significantly contributed to the damage totals, none of the strongest hurricanes hit a densely populated U.S. city like Houston, Tampa or Miami. 

In years past the greatest economic cost came from major hurricanes like Harvey, which impacted densely-populated Houston, costing an estimated $125 billion. That is why 2017, about $450 billion in damage, stands out as one of the years with the greatest damage. 

This year the total figure will be more modest. So far, the total up through September is estimated at $46.6 billion. Smith expects the total number may reach $100 billion and enter the top 5 costliest years, though still far less than the $450 billion cost in 2017 — and an illustration of just how significant a factor intense events hitting population centers are. Smith notes that these damage assessments do not include the human cost, either the loss of life or the impact to health.


Midwest derecho
For a meteorologist, perhaps the most memorable event of the year was the August derecho — a storm Smith described as an inland hurricane — which plowed a path 800 miles long and 40 miles wide through Iowa and Illinois. A broad area experienced hurricane-force winds, sometimes lasting 50 minutes, with gusts reaching 140 mph. 

So far the damage from the derecho is estimated at $7.5 billion, but Smith expects that total to climb as more data is tallied. While this event was not caused by climate change, there is some evidence it was made stronger by it.

"The greatest existential threat"
2020 makes clear just how vulnerable humans have become to the growing ferocity of natural disasters, which will only continue to escalate in a warming world.

"Much of the news about 2020 disasters and the associated records will likely be overshadowed by the pandemic, politics, societal issues, etc.," said Strader. "But lurking in the background is the greatest existential threat facing humankind, climate change. One just has to look at the number of disasters and losses we've witnessed this year. We shouldn't lose sight of this."




Sunday Morning
​Hail and farewell to those we lost in 2020
sunday-morning
December 27, 2020 / 9:47 AM EST / CBS News

"Sunday Morning" pays tribute to the creative, inspiring and newsworthy men and women who passed away this year, who'd touched our lives in unforgettable ways. Lee Cowan reports:

"Sometimes, in our lives,
we all have pain,
we all have sorrow..."

Pain and sorrow – the calling cards of 2020. "Lean on Me" by Bill Withers provided us reassurance that tomorrow may be better. Although Withers left us at 81, his notes of solace helped during a year that wasn't even a month old before grief was already setting in. 

The death of 41-year-old Kobe Bryant, the L.A. Lakers phenom, along with his 13-year-old daughter and seven others, stunned everyone – basketball fans or not.

His passing became a moment of rare unity this year, with people from all walks of life joining together to both celebrate and to mourn.

Michael Jordan said, "Kobe was my dear friend. He was like a little brother."

"My momma always said life was like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're going to get"  

COVID was certainly the box we all wished we never got. But Winston Groom, who created Forrest Gump, reminded us through that character that challenges exist, to be overcome.

"Let me say this: Being an idiot is no box of chocolates, 'cause I reckon I done live a pretty interesting life," Groom said. "You don't have to be rich, and you don't have to be smart. You don't have to be famous to be dignified."

Dignity for Black Americans remained an unfinished struggle this year. The deaths of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor — just to name a few — rekindled a movement for equality and justice not seen since the 1960s.

Congressman John Lewis was still fighting right to the end. "I got in trouble, good trouble. Necessary trouble," he said. "All of the suffering, all of the pain, the beating, the tear gas, it was worth it. If I had it to do all over again, I would march the same way."


After his brother, Medgar, was assassinated by White supremacists in 1963, Charles Evers tried to make change from within – running for Congress, then becoming a mayor. "Not for revenge, but to carry on, to fight for freedom for all mankind regardless of race, creed or color," he said.

We lost those who marched alongside Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., too: Reverends C.T. Vivian and Joseph Lowery.

Rev. Lowery gave the benediction at President Obama's inauguration: "We ask you to help us work for that day when Black will not be asked to 'get back.' When Brown can stick around, when Yellow will be mellow, when the Red man can get ahead, man. And the White will embrace what is right. Say amen, and amen!"

Rafer Johnson, who was the first Black American to captain a U.S. Olympic team in 1960, left us this year. His triumphant win in the decathlon is still talked about to this day.

Rock 'n' roll certainly wasn't immune to racism. "When I came on the scene, Black and White was segregated in dances and shows," said Little Richard. He couldn't always stay or eat where the White performers did, but his fans were of all colors. His energy was boundless, and so was his humor. At the 1988 Grammy Awards he announced a winner: "And the Best New Artist is ... me! I have never received nothing! Y'all ain't ever give me no Grammy and I been singing for years!"

Little Richard: An appreciation of the "Quasar of Rock 'n' Roll" ("Sunday Morning")
The Black Americans we celebrate like Jackie Robinson, James Brown and Thurgood Marshall surely would have been proud of Chadwick Boseman, who portrayed them all. "That's the reason why you act," Boseman said in 2013. "You want to be able to actually identify with the characters that you play and explore humanity."

Tributes pour in as celebrities and fans mourn the death of actor Chadwick Boseman
I am woman, hear me roar
In numbers too big to ignore
And I know too much to go back and pretend
'Cause I've heard it all before
And I've been down there on the floor
No one's ever gonna keep me down again

Gender equality lost some of its superheroes, too. Helen Reddy offered the soundtrack for the fight that she herself waged.

But there were few champions for women as influential as Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. "I do not see myself at all as a legend; I see myself as a person who tries very hard to be a good judge," Ginsburg said.

In her 27 years on the Supreme Court, she expanded rights for women as well as men. Small in stature, a giant for us all.

"I will do this job as long as I feel that I could do it, full steam," she said.

The only thing tougher than Justice Ginsberg was the cancer that took her at age 87. 


The fight for equality took all forms. "For all minorities, for all people, it's just a never-ending battle to fight against the powers-that-be, to prove our worth and our place," said AIDS activist and playwright Larry Kramer.

He was often brash, but effective. Talking about the AIDS epidemic in 1982, Kramer told a reporter, "Most of the country doesn't know about this cancer."

Why? "Well, I think because it's a 'gay cancer.'"

Remembering Larry Kramer, an AIDS warrior on a soapbox and the stage
Kramer fought tirelessly, pressing the government and the public to care more about the gay community – much the way playwright Mart Crowley did. "Homosexuality was just not talked about," Crowley said.

It took him 50 years to see his portrayal of gay life, "The Boys in the Band," finally make it to Broadway. "It's just generally about the human spirit. Suddenly they're not just gay people, they're just people."

Few wrote that storyline better than playwright Terrence McNally, whose tales of love of all kinds won him five Tony Awards, including one for Lifetime Achievement.

Broadway has been dark for months now, but we pause to give thanks to all the creatives we lost, who lit up our world this year nonetheless:

Ann Reinking ("Chicago")

Nick Cordero ("Bullets Over Broadway")

Zoe Caldwell ("Master Class")

Brian Dennehy ("Death of a Salesman")

Performers couldn't play in front of live audiences this year, and that made us miss their talents all the more … especially legends like folk singer John Prine. 

When I get to Heaven,
I'm going to shake God's hand.
I'm going to thank him for more blessings
than one man can stand"

With his nasal, raspy voice, he was often compared to Bob Dylan, who himself was a fan. "Well, I considered myself a writer," Prine said, "so I thought, why can't I be any character I want to be?"

John Prine, the "Singing Mailman," delivers again ("Sunday Morning")
John Prine: At home with the songwriting legend
In whatever genre, country or pop, the bourbon-smooth voice of Kenny Rogers brought us ballads about gamblers, and lost souls searching for love. "I'm not a great singer," Rogers said in 2006, "but I'm a storyteller. If a song moves me, I can make it move other people." 

Kenny Rogers thinking about the future ("Sunday Morning")
Country music was largely an all-White venue, until Charley Pride ("Kiss an Angel Good Morning") came along. His records were huge sellers, and he'd just won a Country Music Association Lifetime Achievement Award. 

His music nourished our soul the way a good meal nourishes the body ... and few were better at that than Cecilia Chiang. Often called the Mother of Chinese food in America, her cooking must have been pretty healthy, because she lived to be 100. 

Cecilia Chiang, the mother of Chinese food in America ("Sunday Morning")
Slim Jims weren't necessarily healthy — Lon Adams didn't intend for them to be — but he sure knew how to package them in ways pretty hard to forget.

The artist Christo took presentation to new heights. He saw all the world as a package to be wrapped.

But if you're going to dress up a landmark, nothing summed up a whole city better than Milton Glaser's "I ♥ NY" logo. It actually changed the way we say love. He died on his 91st birthday.

Passage: Graphic designer Milton Glaser, creator of the "I ♥ NY" logo ("Sunday Morning")
We lost a bit of magic, too, this year, starting with showman Roy Horn – half of the Siegfried and Roy duo – whose entertaining mix of magic and exotic animals dazzled the Las Vegas Strip for decades. "We have been called crazy, outrageous; now they call us colorful and eccentric!" he said.

Ms. Frizzle was certainly "colorful and eccentric"; she was the fictional teacher who drove The Magic School Bus to the delight of every child who read it. Her creator, author Joanna Cole, used her brand of magic to take kids to space – and even inside the human body.

"OK, so this is the experimental test setup for the myth that if you drink a bunch of Diet Coke and eat a bunch of mentos, your stomach will explode," explained Grant Imahara, one of the hosts of Discovery's "Mythbusters." He proved that science can answer all sorts of mysteries, like how to get to the moon.

NASA's Katherine Johnson figured that out, calculating just the right trajectory that got astronauts there and back, including Alfred Worden, one of those who certainly had all the "right stuff."

But it was test pilot Chuck Yeager who defined just what that meant, becoming the first man to break the sound barrier. He made testing the limits his life. "I figured that the airplane wouldn't bite me without giving me some sort of warning, and it worked out," he said.

The World War II fighter ace and Air Force general was 97.


Speaking of the sound barrier ... few cracked it like rocker Eddie Van Halen. He was a true guitar hero. He died from cancer at only 65.

We lost Rush drummer Neil Peart to cancer as well. He was, to some, the Van Halen of the drums – his highly technical solos were really a thing to behold.

Years before Pert, however, there was Viola Smith, hailed as the fastest girl drummer in the world. She played her drum kit wearing sequins.

But when it came to percussion, Ian Finkel says he stood alone. He was the world's greatest xylophonist, he said, because he was one of the few left — until COVID took him at age 72.

COVID also took Ellis Marsalis, the great jazz pianist who gave us a whole family of musicians, including Wynton Marsalis, the musician behind our theme song every Sunday morning.

If there was ever a year we needed a laugh, this one was certainly it. One of the greats could even make the morbid funny. "First thing in the morning before I have coffee, I read the obits. Yes, if I'm not in it, I'll have breakfast," Carl Reiner told "Sunday Morning" in 2015.

Reiner was a comedian in his own right, but he made other people funny, too, as a writer, producer and director.

Golden Boys ("Sunday Morning")
There's funny, and then there's the absurd. ["Spam Spam Spam Spam Spam Lovely Spam Spam"]. Terry Jones, co-founder of Monty Python's Flying Circus, took his irreverent brand of humor to side-splitting extremes.

"How are we today?"
"Better …"
"Better?"
"Better get a bucket, I'm going to throw up!"

Monty Python's Terry Jones: An appreciation of a comic zealot
Contrast that with the gentleness of Walt Disney's entertainment. But when it came to Snow White, he couldn't have done it without Marge Champion. "Everything she does with her hands, or dances or picking up her dress, that's me," she said.

She was the dancer they used to draw those graceful moves. Snow White looked so real, because she was.

Real-life Snow White still the fairest
We lost the creators of Scooby-Doo, too – both of them within months of each other. Joe Ruby and Ken Spears envisioned a gang of teenagers and an ever-hungry Great Dane teaming up to solve ghostly mysteries. 

"I guess I could say there's good trash and there's bad trash. Bad trash are just shows that aren't well-executed," said Fred Silverman. "Scooby-Doo" was commissioned by Silverman, a top executive at CBS, as well as ABC, and NBC. He was one of the most powerful people in the industry – also behind hits like "All in the Family" and "Laverne and Shirley" … which lost one of its stars, too, this year.

David Lander, best known as Squiggy, left us at 73.

To all those who gave us plenty to watch, we bid a fond TV farewell:

Kellye Nakahara ("MASH")

Naya Rivera ("Glee")

James Drury ("The Virginian") 

Sam Lloyd ("Scrubs") 

James Lipton ("Inside the Actor's Studio")

Ken Osmond ("Leave It to Beaver") 

Conchata Ferrell ("Two-and-a-Half Men")

David Schramm ("Wings")

The holidays are tough without the ones we love – unless, that is, you celebrate Festivus: "You gather your family around, and tell them all the ways they have disappointed you over the past year!"

At 92, "Seinfeld" star Jerry Stiller, the father of actor Ben Stiller, is celebrating his invented holiday somewhere else this year.

For 37 years, Alex Trebek gave us the answers to questions yet posed as the unflappable host of "Jeopardy!" "It's the perfect television presentation of the great American Dream," he said.

He was a fixture in our living rooms. His cancer, however, left us all asking why him – and why so soon.

"Sounds impressive: I've got stage 4 cancer, not stage 1 for sissies. That's just beginner's cancer, I've got advanced!" he told Jane Pauley last year.

"Why are you making me laugh?" she asked.

"Well, what else are we going to do?"


But when it came to naming the most versatile TV personality, the "Jeopardy!" answer would have to be "Who is Regis Philbin?" He could do anything, with anyone, no matter the audience. He was everywhere on TV, logging thousands of hours of airtime. Everyone knew him simply as "Regis."

"Some people like a little anonymity in their lives, but it's very hard to do when you're on every day," he said.

From 2005: The iconic Regis Philbin ("Sunday Morning")
Like "Regis," another single name defined for generations just what it means to be both dangerous and suave: "Bond. James Bond." Sean Connery set the standard for all the 007s who would follow.

Passage: Remembering Sean Connery ("Sunday Morning")
But the life of a real British spy is something a little less glamorous. Author John le Carré should know, because, well, he was one. "With the Bond type of novel, the reader thinks, 'I wish I was him.' With the stuff I'm writing, they think, 'Oh Christ, I hope I'm not him!'" he laughed.

He turned his career experiences into a host of spy thrillers.

But le Carré's heroes weren't always flanked by Bond-type beauties. Margaret Nolan, who gave us the world-famous "Goldfinger" image, passed away at 76.

So did her fellow actress in "Goldfinger," Honor Blackman.

But it was Dame Diana Rigg who captivated the secret agent so much; 007 finally tied the knot.

In 2018 Anthony Mason asked Rigg, "What made you wanna be a Bond girl?"

"Oh, come on. Who wouldn't?" she replied.

Rigg would years later go on to captivate a new generation in "Game of Thrones."

"This is a very old and honorable profession," Rigg said of a life on stage and screen. "And you should have a sense of privilege about being in it, because we answer a very profound need in society."

And some of those who answered that need enjoyed the longest lives.

Olivia de Havilland, who was immortalized in "Gone with the Wind" and went on to become a treasured screen actress, left us at the age of 104.

Kirk Douglas, the original chiseled chin, had a commanding, often muscular presence in just about everything he did. He made it to 103.

To all those who took us somewhere we couldn't go ourselves, we bid a fond goodbye:

Diana Serra Cary ("Baby Peggy" of silent films)

Rhonda Fleming ("A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court") 

Shirley Knight ("Sweet Bird of Youth")

David Prowse (Darth Vader in the original "Star Wars" trilogy)

Jeremy Bulloch (Boba Fett, "The Empire Strikes Back")

Kelly Preston ("Jerry Maguire") 

Thomas Jefferson Byrd ("Get on the Bus")

Ian Holm ("Alien," "The Lord of the Rings")

Max von Sydow ("The Seventh Seal," "The Exorcist")

Max von Sydow: The actor who commands silence ("CBS This Morning")
Esther Scott ("Boyz n the Hood") 

Irrfan Khan ("Life of Pi")

"I suppose, in the end, the whole of life becomes an act of letting go," Khan's character said in 2012's "Life of Pi." "But what always hurts the most is not taking a moment to say goodbye."

Journalism lost some of its brightest stars, too.

You might know Jim Lehrer from the "PBS News Hour," but he was also known for his skill in moderating presidential debates. We lost him this year. 

Remembering Jim Lehrer ("CBS Evening News")

… as well as journalist and author Gail Sheehy. Her book "Passages" gave us a road map to adult life: "I had to know, what was going to happen at the next stage, and the next stage, and the next stage."

Gail Sheehy's "Sex & the Seasoned Woman" ("The Early Show")
Our family here at CBS News is a bit smaller this year. 

Bert Quint took us around the world as a foreign correspondent.

Bill Small was CBS' tireless Washington Bureau Chief through the civil rights movement, Watergate and Vietnam. 

And Maria Mercader, a network news veteran, was one of the earliest victims of COVID – and she was a friend to us all.

For all its faults, 2020 did remind us of the gift of giving. 

Doris Buffett, the elder sister to billionaire Warren Buffett, gave her money (as well as his) to good causes everywhere. "I just feel like I have a job to do," she said, "and if I do it right, other people, there are going to be hundreds, thousands of homes, that will be improved. Children will have chances. Women will have chances."

"We're livin' in tough times. We need hope," said art dealer Forrest Fenn. He sent people scampering through the Rocky Mountains looking for a chest full of gold nuggets and jewels he had hidden for anyone to find. After 10 years someone finally found his treasure, just three months before Fenn died.

"We need to know that somewhere out there, there's a rainbow with a pot of gold at the end of it," Fenn said.

The hunt for Forrest Fenn's treasure ("Sunday Morning")
I can see clearly now the rain is gone
I can see all obstacles in my way

If there's any treasure the rest of us can bank on after this dark year, it's that courage and kindness usually triumph in the end. Johnny Nash, who left us at 80 this year, sang of a "bright sunshiny day."



U.S.
Thousands gather for 2020 March on Washington
By Audrey McNamara

Updated on: August 28, 2020 / 5:08 PM EDT / CBS News


Fifty-seven years after Martin Luther King Jr.'s "I Have a Dream" speech at the March on Washington, the families of Black Americans shot or killed by police officers spoke at the same site Friday, the Lincoln Memorial in Washington D.C. The families of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Eric Garner and Jacob Blake joined Reverend Al Sharpton and Martin Luther King III at the Commitment March: Get Your Knee off Our Necks, which drew an estimated thousands. 

The march, organized by the National Action Network, was calling for racial justice and police reform. Sharpton first announced plans for the march during a memorial service for George Floyd, the 46-year-old father who died at the hands of police in Minneapolis in May.

"George Floyd's story has been the story of Black folks because ever since 401 years ago, the reason we could never be who we wanted and dreamed to be is you kept your knee on our neck," Sharpton said at the service in June. "It's time for us to stand up in George's name and say, 'Get your knee off our necks!'"

George Floyd's brother, Philonise Floyd, told the crowd Friday he was overwhelmed by the support, and said he wished "George were here to see this right now." His sister, Bridgett Floyd, said, "we have to be the change."

The mothers of Dontre Hamilton, Trayvon Martin and Ahmaud Arbery also spoke. 


"Even though we're going through a crisis, even though it looks dark, I want to tell you to be encouraged," said Martin's mother Sybrina Fulton. "Don't stop saying Black lives matter, don't stop protesting," she said. 

In the months since Floyd's death, Black Lives Matter marches have proliferated across the country. Protesters continue to call for justice for the officers charged in Floyd's death, and those involved in other controversial cases including the death of Breonna Taylor, who was shot and killed by officers in her own home in Louisville, and Elijah McClain, who died after a police chokehold in Aurora, Colorado, last summer.

Protests erupted again this week following the shooting of Jacob Blake in Kenosha, Wisconsin. Blake, a 29-year-old Black man, was hospitalized after police shot him several times in the back as he opened the door of his parked car. Attorneys for his family say he is now paralyzed.


Blake's father spoke at the march on Friday, and used it as an opportunity to "hold court" against systematic racism in America. "We're going to have court right now. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. Racism against all of us. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty," he said. "… And we're not taking it anymore."


"We're going to stand up, every Black person in the United States is going to stand up," he said. "We're tired. I'm tired of looking at cameras and seeing these young Black and Brown people suffer."

His words, spoken on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, come 57 years after his own father attended the original March on Washington, according to Blake. "I have a duty," he said. "I have a duty to support and understand each one — I love everybody in this crowd, I love you."


Democratic vice presidential nominee Kamala Harris recorded brief remarks for the march that played during the event on Friday.

Harris, who tweeted her address Thursday night, said that if civil rights activists from the 1960s were here today, they "would share in our anger and frustration as we continue to see Black men and women slain in our streets and left behind by an economy and justice system that have too often denied Black folks our dignity and rights." 

"They would share our anger and pain, but no doubt they would turn it into fuel," Harris continued. "They would be lacing up their shoes, locking arms and continuing right alongside us to continue in this ongoing fight for justice."

Harris said Americans are once again in a position to make history. "The road ahead is not going to be easy," she said, adding, "we have an opportunity to make history, right here and right now."

Other lawmakers spoke about the need to pass legislation crafted to confront racial injustice. Texas Congressman Sheila Jackson Lee asked the crowd, "how did this happen?" answering, "because of institutional racism." Lee urged for the passage of her bill H.R. 40, which would establish a commission to "study and develop reparation proposals for African-Americans."


Congresswoman Joyce Beatty, a member of the Congressional Black Caucus, demanded that the Voting Rights Act of 1965 be fully restored. The act established federal oversight of election laws in states with a history of racial discrimination, but key sections of the legislation were struck down by the Supreme Court in 2013.

The late Congressman John Lewis spent much of his life fighting for voting rights and was a champion of the act, which passed in part because of his march in Selma, Alabama. Lewis continued to fight for its restoration until his death in July. 

"We are here today because people died, and were denied basic civil rights," Beatty said. "... John Lewis left us with marching orders."

Reverend Al Sharpton also invoked Lewis in his speech. With a nod to his advocacy of getting into "good trouble," Sharpton said, "we didn't come to start trouble, we came to stop trouble."

"Black lives matter," Sharpton said. "And we won't stop until it matters to everybody."

MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm Margaret Brennan in Washington. And this week on FACE THE NATION, halfway through this year's unconventional political conventions, the spotlight turns to the Republicans to make their case that President Trump deserves a second term. With the Democratic convention now a wrap, its message was loud and clear and far more negative than in years past. But in 2020, there is no business as usual.
 
JOE BIDEN: The current President has cloaked America in darkness for much too long. Too much anger. Too much fear. Too much division.
 
PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: This administration has shown it will tear our democracy down if that's what it takes for them to win.
 
MARGARET BRENNAN: The contrast will be stark. A new CBS News poll shows very different views from Republicans.
 
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Make sure your vote gets counted. Make sure because the only way we're going to lose this election is if the election is rigged.
 
MARGARET BRENNAN: That kind of talk from Mister Trump has fueled a furious political battle over the Postal Service. We'll have the latest on efforts to ensure your vote gets counted. Plus, we'll hear what the GOP has planned this week from the head of the Republican Party, Ronna McDaniel. Biden national campaign co-chair and Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti will also join us. And will the convention be overshadowed by the stunning arrest of former Trump White House aide in 2016 campaign strategist Steve Bannon. He's been charged with fraud in a fundraising scheme to build the President's border wall. This, as the Republican-led Senate Intelligence Committee concluded that former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort's ties to Russia pose a "…grave counterintelligence threat" during the 2016 campaign. We'll talk with the former head of the FBI James Comey. We'll get the latest on the coronavirus from former FDA Commissioner Doctor Scott Gottlieb, then talk with the president of the University of Arizona Robert Robbins as some schools are forced to make dramatic changes in their COVID-era learning plans as students head back to school.
 
It's all just ahead on FACE THE NATION.
 
Good morning and welcome to FACE THE NATION. With just ten weeks to go until Election Day, former Vice President Joe Biden has maintained his ten-point lead over President Trump following the Democratic convention. That's according to our CBS News Battleground Tracker. And there is yet another scandal facing the President on the eve of his convention, new audio recordings have surfaced of President Trump's sister Maryanne Trump Barry sharing some candid thoughts about her brother. CBS News has obtained those tapes and as of, yet, we have not independently verified their authenticity. White House correspondent Weijia Jiang reports.
 
WEIJIA JIANG (CBS News White House Correspondent/@weijia): Margaret, the recordings paint President Trump as a liar who does not read and even paid someone to take his SATs. This morning White House chief of staff Mark Meadows brushed off the statements on ABC saying just another day, and another attack.
 
(Begin VT)
 
MARY TRUMP: That existed--
 
WEIJIA JIANG: President Trump's niece, Mary Trump, who recently released a book criticizing her uncle, allegedly recorded conversation she had with her aunt in 2018 and 2019. Maryanne Trump Barry was a federal judge at the time and said her brother is, quote, "cruel."
 
MARYANNE TRUMP BARRY: All he wants to do is appeal to his base, he has no principles, none, none. And his base, I mean, my God, if you are a religious person you want to help people, not do this.
 
WEIJIA JIANG: President Trump spent the week waging a personal war on mail-in voting.
 
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: This will be the greatest catastrophe, one of the greatest catastrophes in the history of our country. That's how serious it is. And they also think I'm trying to steal an election. Just the opposite: I want the fair results of an election.
 
WEIJIA JIANG: But Democrats are convinced the President is trying to control the outcome of the election by slashing resources to the U.S. Postal Service, which could cause balance to be delivered too late to count.
 
REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: Don't pay any attention to what the President is saying, because it is all designed to suppress the vote.
 
MAN: The bill is passed.
 
WEIJIA JIANG: In a rare summer Saturday session, House lawmakers passed an emergency measure to send the Postal Service twenty-five billion dollars to help process ballots. Republican lawmakers agreed with President Trump.
 
REPRESENTATIVE DREW FERGUSON (R-Georgia): This bill is a sham. We are piling up money we might as well put it on the national ball-- National Mall and have a bonfire.
 
WEIJIA JIANG: The bill would also reverse recent operational changes that resulted in nationwide mail delays, forcing the return of machines and mailboxes that were already removed. A new CBS News Battleground Tracker finds three-fourths of Republicans believe they are better off now than they were four years ago. Republicans also agree with Mister Trump's handling of the economy with sixty-seven percent saying it's in good condition.
 
(End VT)
 
WEIJIA JIANG: President Trump plans to participate every night of the Republican National Convention, which kicks off tomorrow. Campaign officials say he will present a contrast the, quote, "dim and dark view" of the country that Democrats offered. And the President's chief of staff promises Americans will see a new side of the President. Margaret.
 
MARGARET BRENNAN: Weijia, thank you.
 
We turn now to Republican National Committee Chair Ronna McDaniel. She joins us from Charlotte. Good morning to you.
 
RONNA MCDANIEL (Republican National Committee Chair/@GOPChairwoman): Good morning. Great to be with you.
 
MARGARET BRENNAN: I know you're quite busy. The RNC nomination, formally, of President Trump is scheduled for tomorrow. Will he be in Charlotte at all? Can you tell us anything about what to expect?
 
RONNA MCDANIEL: Well, he will be in North Carolina, unlike Joe Biden, who didn't go to Wisconsin, the state where he held his convention. The President has an event planned in Asheville. He hasn't confirmed if he's going to come by Charlotte yet, but we have the delegates here.
 
MARGARET BRENNAN: The AP is reporting that the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, will be addressing the forum from Israel where he's on official business. This lineup, when you start hearing about cabinet members being involved-- I mean, first of all, it's very unusual for a diplomat to get involved in domestic politics. But this starts to look like using taxpayer-funded federal resources for a campaign. Will taxpayers be reimbursed?
 
RONNA MCDANIEL: I can only tell you, Margaret, that the events that we've put forward from the RNC and the campaign are going to be paid for by the convention from-- from-- of the RNC and the campaign. You know, everything that we've put together has changed because of COVID. The President rightly said we're going to leave Jacksonville because we don't want to have resources taken away from a city that's dealing with a pandemic. And he brought it back to the White House, which is his residence.
 
MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.
 
RONNA MCDANIEL: And it's being paid for by the Republican National Committee and the campaign, not the taxpayers.
 
MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you are confirming that Pompeo's trip will be reimbursed by the campaign?
 
RONNA MCDANIEL: I-- I am not confirming anything having to do with Secretary Pompeo's trip. I am just saying the programming, the staging, everything that we're doing will be paid for by the Republican National Committee and the campaign.
 
MARGARET BRENNAN: You will have, as you said, some in-person activity there in Charlotte. I heard you have something like three hundred people gathering there for official business. How are you going to protect them all from COVID? This is a mass gathering.
 
RONNA MCDANIEL: You know, Margaret, I think it's really important to understand that the Democrats and Joe Biden just said we're going to shut this country down again. And that is a really elite view of America right now. Now from a safety perspective, we tested everybody before they came to Charlotte. We have been testing people on site. We are doing the things that are allowing people to live their lives, have a convention and do it in a healthy and safe way--
 
MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.
 
RONNA MCDANIEL: --which most Americans are doing going back to work because they're going to the grocery store, as they're going to hospitals. This is a realistic way of opening up our country and doing it in a health-- healthy and safe way. And the Democrats are saying, shut it all down. Well, that's easy for Hollywood celebrities and privileged politicians but that's not good for average Americans.
 
MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about the election itself. The President has said he expects this to be one of the most fraudulent, if not the most fraudulent in history. He's against mail-in ballots, but the Republican Party in Iowa has mailed absentee ballots to voters. Politico is reporting Pennsylvania, the GOP website is promoting vote-by-mail, similar situation in Ohio. Why is the Republican Party promoting something that the President says he's against?
 
RONNA MCDANIEL: I'm so glad you asked me this question because there is a very real difference between states that have tried and true absentee processes that have been in place and have been tested and work versus states like Nevada that ninety days out from an election have completely upended their entire election protocol and put chaos into their process because they haven't tested it and it isn't certain.
 
MARGARET BRENNAN: But the post office said this week--
 
RONNA MCDANIEL: And why are they doing that?
 
MARGARET BRENNAN: --that they can handle the mail volume-- volume. They don't have a problem.
 
RONNA MCDANIEL: It's not about just the post office, Margaret. It's that they're sending ballots to unverified voter rolls. I just talked to a voter this week who said she's received three ballots for a different woman at her address, a person that's never lived there. These are the type of things--
 
MARGARET BRENNAN: A ballot or an application for a ballot?
 
RONNA MCDANIEL: An actual ballot. An actual ballot. She was in California. In Nevada and California, they aren't sending absentee request forms. They're sending live ballots, which I think is a huge problem. Getting an absentee request form--
 
MARGARET BRENNAN: But to be-- to be clear the Republican Party in these states is promoting mail-in voting. Is the Republican Party--
 
RONNA MCDANIEL: No. We are-- we are--
 
MARGARET BRENNAN: --supportive of that?
 
RONNA MCDANIEL: --promoting people embracing the absentee processes that have been put in place, that are tried and true. And we are suing states that are trying to change their process ninety days out from an election, which is adding chaos to an election where we should have certainty.
 
MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about some of our data that we just got. CBS News has a Battleground Tracker out, and it's showing a big divide between how Republicans view the U.S. response to the coronavirus and how the majority of voters see it. Seventy-three percent of Republicans say it's going well. Thirty-eight percent of all voters say it's going well by comparison. Then fifty-seven percent of Republicans say the number of dead is acceptable at a hundred and seventy thousand people. Thirty-three percent of independents say it's acceptable, just ten percent of Democrats. How could that number be acceptable? And why is there such a big divide between how Republicans see it and how the majority of people do?
 
RONNA MCDANIEL: Well, I think that is a really unfair poll and-- and, of course, there is nobody in this country, there is nobody starting with the President of the United States who wants to see people pass away from this global pandemic that came here from China not being honest, from the WHO failing in their one duty, their one duty, to identify a pandemic. And they failed the global community. But let's be honest, Republicans do want-- do not want to see people suffering from this pandemic. We have all been affected by this. This is not a Republican or Democrat issue. When you see Democrats continue--
 
MARGARET BRENNAN: So you say that number is acceptable? You--
 
RONNA MCDANIEL: No, of course, not, Margaret. This is a global pandemic. Nobody wants to see somebody die from this. I have-- have had friends die from this. This is not something people want. But the President's response has saved lives by shutting down travel early, which Joe Biden called xenophobic, by doing the decisive actions he did earlier--
 
MARGARET BRENNAN: From China, but not Europe.
 
RONNA MCDANIEL: He did it from Europe as well, but Joe Biden didn't--
 
MARGARET BRENNAN: Not until March.
 
RONNA MCDANIEL: But Joe Biden didn't support that. You didn't hear him come out and say we should shut down travel from Europe. You didn't hear Democrats saying that. They have opposed this President every step of the way. In a time of crisis when we should be coming together as Americans, this should not be politicized.
 
MARGARET BRENNAN: One area where Republicans also differ from voters overall is on the Black Lives Matter movement. Most voters nationwide agree with the ideas of it, while most Republicans, two-thirds of them, strongly disagree. Eight in ten Republicans think there has been too much attention on the issue of discrimination. Doesn't this type of thinking hurt Republicans' chances of making gains with black voters?
 
RONNA MCDANIEL: Well, I think that there's a big distinction between the words Black Lives Matter and the movement, which has been led by people who embrace Marxism, who have said on networks, we want to burn this country down. And I think you have to separate that, because as we are seeing in the name of Black Lives Matter, these riots and these looters who really aren't affiliated with any type of peaceful protest, we all condemn what happened to George Floyd. Republicans and Democrats alike recognize that.
 
MARGARET BRENNAN: So you don't think there has been too much attention on the issue of discrimination? That was eight in ten Republicans said too much attention on that issue. Not the movement, but the issue.
 
RONNA MCDANIEL: You know who's given more attention to discrimination than anybody? This President. He's the one who passed the First Steps Act to get rid of the injustices in our criminal justice reform. This is our President who's pardoned people who were unjustly charged with crimes and sentenced to lengthy sentences disproportionately affecting the black community. This is the President who gave more loans to HBCUs. This is the President that created economic opportunity zones. This is the President who has tackled discrimination. And he's going to continue to do so. And you're going to hear more about that next week in our convention as he talks about the policies he's put forward and how they have improved the lives of everyday Americans.
 
MARGARET BRENNAN: Ronna McDaniel, thank you for your time.
 
RONNA MCDANIEL: Thanks, Margaret.
 
MARGARET BRENNAN: We want to go now to national co-chair for the Biden campaign, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti. Good morning to you.
 
ERIC GARCETTI (Mayor of Los Angeles/@MayorOfLA/ National Co-Chair, Biden-Harris Campaign): Great to be with you, Margaret, thank you for having me.
 
MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to start on the issue of voting, because your state was specifically mentioned there by Ronna McDaniel as having increased mail-in ballots during the pandemic. During the March presidential primary more than a hundred thousand mail-in ballots were rejected by election officials, according to data that had been gathered by the AP. Given that experience doesn't that indicate that there are some significant gaps in terms of your state's election integrity?
 
ERIC GARCETTI: A democracy is not an easy thing, Margaret, of course, but I have a very deep confidence in our secretary of state, Alex Padilla, in our counties, to be able to run elections and to run them well. And the difference is that we're trying to run elections that expand democracy, that give the vote to everybody where we see a war on voters in other states run by Republicans who literally want to take people off the ballot, take them off the election rolls, you know, a period here, a different-- a middle initial. We saw it happen with Stacey Abrams in Georgia. She would be governor today--
 
MARGARET BRENNAN: And Ronna McDaniel is saying you're adding people.
 
ERIC GARCETTI: And it's kind of ironic that Republicans-- no, we are making sure that every American in California who can vote will vote. That is, I think, what a democracy is about. Why we make it so difficult for Americans to vote--
 
MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.
 
ERIC GARCETTI: --seems to be anti-democratic with a small D. And so we're going to make sure that we have not only safe and secure elections, but a paper trail as well, something I think all folks from both the right and left have called for, for years.
 
MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay.
 
ERIC GARCETTI: I simply don't understand why this President fears this. It's probably because he knows he's going to lose.
 
MARGARET BRENNAN: On the issue of the economy, that is one area where President Trump still seems to poll-- have better poll results than candidate Biden does in terms of perception of who would be better for it. Joe Biden said a lot of things in his address this week, but he gave virtually no detail on his economic plans and no detailed criticism of President Trump's either. Isn't that a mistake?
 
ERIC GARCETTI: Mm-Hm. Well, I-- I know here's the-- the facts, Margaret, Democratic Presidents have added sixty million jobs to America, Republican ones, twenty-three million in the last few decades. You want to see the stock market do better, the GDP over-perform, that's always been under a Democratic President and not a Republican one. And we're very proud of the plans that we have to not only bring back jobs, manufacturing--
 
MARGARET BRENNAN: But isn't the slogan "Build Back Better"? Wouldn't you need to, if that's your slogan, explain how you're going to do it? Joe Biden mentioned the economy four times. Economic was a phrase used four times, mentions five million jobs, but didn't say how he was going to do it. Why not emphasize that?
 
ERIC GARCETTI: We-- we have been talking until we're blue in the face about the most progressive and most expansive economic plan that we will see in our, I think in our lifetimes in America. Build Back Better has four different planks to it. One is to invest in infrastructure, in a new green energy economy and careers throughout America. Two is manufacturing back in America, unlike this President who said he'd bring jobs back but has been offshoring federal contracts to foreign companies since he has been President. We'll build back everywhere in America. And, third, the care economy. So many Americans-- and it's such a contrast in these campaigns, Joe Biden, Kamala Harris are about what we can do to care for one another, whether it's our kids right now in child care--
 
MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.
 
ERIC GARCETTI: --or whether it's our seniors in the end of their lifetime. And then something that's usually a peripheral issue, racial justice is a core part, the fourth pillar of that plan. So we have detailed that you go to President Trump's website, just like when he ran last time, there's two or three things on the economy and that's it. It was build a wall.
 
MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.
 
ERIC GARCETTI: It was get rid of immigrants. He has no plan. And he's killing Americans right now and killing our economy. I think it's such a contrast between two people who have a heart and experience--
 
MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.
 
ERIC GARCETTI: --what this country needs, and a man who has neither.
 
MARGARET BRENNAN: Killing Americans is-- is a strong phrase there. I'm going to ask you about what's happening with Covid-19 in your own city. You told CNN last month that it is becoming much more of a Latino disease. Why is it still such an issue that people of color in your city are disproportionately affected?
 
ERIC GARCETTI: Well, a couple of statistics, what our lowest hospitalization rate since this has been recorded, we're at a positivity rate now that's about six percent. So we're really, I think, making huge progress and proud of that. But we're being left on our own. We're the first city in America to cut, I think, the African-American deaths, which were double throughout the country to under the population here. But for the Latino population, which I'm a part of and I come from, I think there's a couple of things. One is you had federal assistance that didn't go to many immigrants and to their families who could be married to or the child of an immigrant. And you didn't get the same money your fellow American citizens did. So they're being pushed to work more. They don't have access to the unemployment. They don't have as much of the kind of social network right now that we need. But we're making huge inroads, including in the Latino community right now. But this is something where you saw this President plant a seed when he ran for President, demonizing folks who are Latino, saying Mexican Americans were murderers and rapists and maybe there was a few good ones. This stuff has ramifications because it washes through a government--
 
MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.
 
ERIC GARCETTI: --that thinks it doesn't have to serve cities, doesn't have to serve Latinos. And we're seeing those numbers rise.
 
MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. I want to talk about your management, though, in your city. You made an interesting choice this week. You actually shut off the power at a Hollywood home after they were hosting large parties there because it wasn't abiding by your regulations regarding the pandemic. How many other houses are you going to shut off the utilities at? Why aren't people listening to you?
 
ERIC GARCETTI: People are listening, they're far and few between our numbers are coming down, but where people don't listen, we're going to shut them down. That's critically important. This is not a time to be spreading this disease, especially younger people. And, by the way, I want to thank all the young people who said shut it down because they saw their peers acting irresponsibly. At super spreader events ten percent of people, Margaret, usually are responsible for about eighty percent of the cases. And we're just not playing here.
 
MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.
 
ERIC GARCETTI: We are not going to let people take our lives into their hands so they're shut down.
 
MARGARET BRENNAN: Mayor Garcetti, thank you for your time.
 
And FACE THE NATION will be back in one minute with former FBI Director James Comey. Stay with us.
 
(ANNOUNCEMENTS)
 
MARGARET BRENNAN: And we are back with former FBI Director James Comey. He used to be a registered Republican, but this week he will speak at the Convention on Founding Principles, which is a gathering of Republicans who are not happy with President Trump. Good morning to you.
 
JAMES COMEY (Former FBI Director/@Comey): Good morning, Margaret.
 
MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to get your reaction and insight into what we learned this week, which was that the Southern District of New York indicted former Trump White House official and campaign strategist Steve Bannon for alleged fraud. He's now the sixth close Trump associate to be criminally charged by the DOJ. You used to run the SDNY. What do you make of this case?
 
JAMES COMEY: Well, it's another reminder of the kind of people this President surrounds himself with. At this point, they could almost start their own crime family. It's a very serious case. The Southern District of New York has laid it out in a very detailed indictment called a speaking indictment. And he's in a world of trouble.
 
MARGARET BRENNAN: A world of trouble. What do you mean by that?
 
JAMES COMEY: Well, it's a very serious fraud case with a huge amount of money stolen from innocent victims, Americans who thought they were giving money to support the President's wall on the Mexican border and, instead, it was stolen. That will drive up the potential punishments for Mister Bannon and his co-conspirators. And, you know, he's in trouble because the indictment lays it out in such detail, including excerpts from texts. If you're Steve Bannon, you're his lawyers, you're reading this saying, I'm going down here. And I don't know what the next steps are for him and his co-defendants, but that's what I meant by world of trouble.
 
MARGARET BRENNAN: The Senate Intelligence Committee, we know, also sent a letter to the Southern District asking them to investigate Bannon for lying to Congress. Is there more that the public leads-- needs to know about Steve Bannon and any links to election interference?
 
JAMES COMEY: I don't know. I don't know what the Southern District of New York is doing. I think this indictment surprised a lot of people because they did it like the pros they are. They didn't talk about it until they were ready to bring the case. But people can learn an awful lot about Russia and the Trump campaign just by reading the thousand pages that the Senate Intelligence Committee put out this week. It tells a story that blows up the President's nonsense about it being a hoax, that blows up Bill Barr's nonsense about there being nothing to investigate. There's a story there that the American people, if they're interested, can read and learn a whole lot about the kind of characters who were working with Russia during the 2016 campaign.
 
MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you more about that in a moment. We will have to take a break. But, very quickly, what do you see as the biggest threat to the rule of law right now?
 
JAMES COMEY: That even-handed law enforcement has disappeared from the Justice Department under Bill Barr and Donald Trump. It shouldn't matter whether Trump likes you or not. Everybody should get a fair shake. And that the truth is under attack--
 
MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay.
 
JAMES COMEY: --both by the attorney general and the President. Those things matter. That's why I'm speaking for the first time--
 
MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay.
 
JAMES COMEY: --ever at a political event this week.
 
MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. We're going to take a break and come back and continue our conversation with former Director Comey in just a few minutes.
 
(ANNOUNCEMENTS)
 
MARGARET BRENNAN: And this programming note, starting tomorrow night and running through Thursday, CBS will bring you coverage of the Republican National Convention led by CBS EVENING NEWS anchor Norah O'Donnell, along with our political team. Tune in. Beginning at 10 PM Eastern.
 
(ANNOUNCEMENTS)
 
MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back with more from former FBI director James Comey and later the latest on the coronavirus from Dr. Scott Gottlieb. Stay with us.
 
(ANNOUNCEMENTS)
 
MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION.
 
We're continuing our conversation with former FBI Director James Comey. I want to pick up where we left off, which was that Senate Intelligence report. This is a bipartisan report, meaning Republicans signed off on it. This was three years long. And the conclusion here was that Trump campaign chair Paul Manafort represented a, quote, "grave counterintelligence threat" to the U.S. because of his close work with Russian intelligence officer Konstantin Kilimnik. This goes farther than what Mueller concluded and made public. Why? Why is the public just now hearing about it?
 
JAMES COMEY: Because the Senate Intelligence Committee was looking at all information they could gather. Mueller was approaching it as a prosecutor, trying to see what evidence he could bring into court to prove something beyond a reasonable doubt. And so the Senate Intelligence Committee could look much more broadly and, as you said, came to this conclusion that the head of Trump's campaign was funneling information to a Russian intelligence officer, someone he likely knew was a Russian intelligence officer. Let that sink in and then ask yourself, so there was nothing to investigate here, as Bill Barr says, it was a hoax? The Republicans have exploded that nonsense.
 
MARGARET BRENNAN: The report, though, also was critical of your old agency, the FBI. It said your bureau should have done more to alert DNC officials that Russian hackers had accessed their servers. Why didn't the FBI do this? This was a national security threat happening under the nose of the FBI.
 
JAMES COMEY: Yeah. That's-- I understand that. That's fair criticism. I think at the time, our folks thought that just telling an institution that the Russians are inside your house was enough. But I think part of what may have led to a lack of urgency at the DNC and at the FBI is that nobody anticipated this wasn't normal intelligence gathering by the Russians, this was an effort to weaponize. And if anybody had seen that, I think they would have yelled a little bit more loudly.
 
MARGARET BRENNAN: Was that a mistake on your part? I mean, how did the FBI miss that this was an active measures campaign by a foreign intelligence service?
 
JAMES COMEY: That's a great question. I think the simple answer is because it had never happened before, but if I were still director of the FBI, that wouldn't be a good enough answer. I hope they're taking a look back across the intelligence community and asking, so why didn't we imagine that the Russians might do this? But the truth is that we didn't. Nobody in the intelligence community did.
 
MARGARET BRENNAN: When you were FBI director, you never imagined this scenario. I mean don't you think this was a mistake on your part?
 
JAMES COMEY: I sure think it was a miss-- a-- a mistake, I'm not going to quibble on words. Yeah, it was a miss. I don't know why it didn't occur to us that the Russians were doing something that they had never done before, which is to weaponize and actually fire stolen material at our Democratic process. And, look, looking back in hindsight, it seems obvious. I don't know the answer as to why nobody in the intelligence community, none of the analysts, saw this coming. And it ought to be something that we're asking ourselves.
 
MARGARET BRENNAN: Are we still this vulnerable?
 
JAMES COMEY: Yes, in a different way. I'm sure the Russians will use different tactics because we figured out what they were last time. They achieved their objectives in the last election. They've done incredibly well under President Trump. They want him to stay in office. They'll be coming again. And the problem for us as Americans is you can't effectively stop a threat that the President won't even acknowledge exists. And so, sure, they're going to be in our house again, messing with us. The only way we're going to kick Putin out of our elections is to elect Joe Biden President so someone finally puts real pain on the Russians.
 
MARGARET BRENNAN: What does real pain look like? I mean we've been warned by the U.S. intelligence community that interference is happening again. President Trump is talking about election interference in very different terms. I actually want to play for you something that he said this week. He said that this will be the most fraudulent election in U.S. history. And he told this to Fox News.
 
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP (on phone): We're going to have everything. We're going to have sheriffs, and we're going to have law enforcement, and we're going to have, hopefully, U.S. attorneys, and we're going to have everybody and attorney generals.
 
MARGARET BRENNAN: He's talking about fraud at the ballot box. He's talking about fraud in the mail. He's talking about fraud by receiving a ballot in the first place. What the President just described in that soundbite is, frankly, illegal in many states. It's up to local authorities when it comes to sending out local law enforcement, but he's making clear what he wants to see happen. What do you make of what he's laying out?
 
JAMES COMEY: Well, I'm sure the next question Fox News asked was, what are the facts that support your allegations of fraud? And there were crickets. I trust state, local and federal law enforcement to honor their oath to the rule of law and to not be part of suppressing votes. There's a legitimate role for law enforcement to play in connection with elections. And I'm confident that the men and women in law enforcement at all levels will abide by their oath.
 
MARGARET BRENNAN: In other words, not do this. In terms of--
 
JAMES COMEY: Yeah. We-- this is-- this is America. We don't-- we don't-- at least we don't anymore, we did it a whole lot to African-Americans when I was a child, we don't anymore use cops to scare people away from polling places. We just don't do it. And I'm confident that police officers around this country are not interested in being part of an illegitimate effort like that.
 
MARGARET BRENNAN: I have to ask you the Justice Department is investigating the investigation into 2016. Do you know if you are a witness or a target or have you sat for an interview with John Durham as part of the investigation?
 
JAMES COMEY: Yeah, I have no idea. I've had no contact with him and haven't talked to him.
 
MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you believe that that means you are a target?
 
JAMES COMEY: I can't imagine that I'm a target. I saw the news report that John Brennan-- Brennan was a witness. I-- given that I know what happened during 2016, which was a bunch of people trying to do the right thing consistent with the law, I'm not worried at all about that investigation of the investigation. Next, I'm sure will be an investigation of the investigation of the investigation. They just want to have an investigation to talk about.
 
MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about a tweet you sent this week. You sent out a picture of yourself wearing a T-shirt that said, you know, more women should be elected, more votes for women. Of course, it is the-- the week honoring ratification of the 19th Amendment. But it drew this response that we just put up for our viewers from Hillary Clinton, who is just sort of making a smirk. I know she's said in the past that she thought she was on the verge of winning in 2016 until you reopened that e-mail investigation. Do you see this as contradictory? Do you regret what happened then? Because she, clearly, sees this as a contradiction for you to say now.
 
JAMES COMEY: Yeah. Look, I think it's pretty funny. And I get why she would send something like that. She's better at Twitter than I am. But I-- I regret only being involved in the 2016 election. We were stuck, and I think we made the right decisions choosing between terrible options. And so I wasn't trying, nor was anybody else in the FBI trying to elect or not elect anyone. And I hope more women get elected to office. I'm proud of that shirt that my daughters and my wife gave me. And I think it's time for more women to be leaders in this country. We'll all be better off.
 
MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we agree with you on that point. Thank you very much, Jim Comey, for your time.
 
We will be right back.

MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to our continuing coverage of the coronavirus with CBS News national correspondent Mark Strassmann, who reports from Atlanta, Georgia.
 
(Begin VT)
 
MARK STRASSMANN (CBS News National Correspondent): At COVID University partying students have inflamed viral outbreaks, fuming administrators and campus anxiety.
 
BRIAN SALVATORE (Professor, LSU Shreveport): We also have a lot of older faculty and staff. And we're all vulnerable.
 
MARK STRASSMANN: Dozens of schools already have reversed plans. They've switched undergraduates to all virtual classrooms, and offered a course in consequences. Syracuse suspended twenty-three partiers; Purdue, thirty-six; St. Olaf in Minnesota, seventeen; North Carolina State University has had multiple COVID clusters.
 
DR. RANDY WOODSON (Chancellor, NC State University): We've seen behaviors off-campus that, frankly, are inconsistent with our community standards and have-- have had an impact on our ability to go forward.
 
MARK STRASSMANN: But human nature's always the X factor, and fingers crossed is a poor COVID defense. Students have blamed administrators for poor planning. At Notre Dame, three hundred seventy-two people have tested positive. The student paper's front-page editorial "Don't make us write obituaries." Across America, fewer people are dying from COVID. Death rates are down or flat in thirty-eight states and up in twelve. A month ago deaths were up in twenty-six states. But America's Heartland has more COVID troubles. Rising cases in twelve states, including North Dakota, Wyoming, Kansas, and Missouri. South Dakota's average daily case loads are up fifty-eight percent. Just one week ago, the state hosted a biker rally with a quarter million attendees.
 
CROWD (in unison): Let us play. Let us pray.
 
MARK STRASSMANN: Feeling normal again is behind the push to play fall sports. In Division One college football's most competitive tier, there are one hundred thirty schools. Fifty-four programs so far have shut down this fall. But some schools required testing of all arriving students. COVID stampeded on campus anyway. And with this virus, getting it wrong in the first few weeks fuels a crisis.
 
(End VT)
 
MARK STRASSMANN: Georgia's COVID case is improving. Like other southern states, it's been a hot spot for months. But now the Southeast faces another danger: A pair of tropical storms named Marco and Laura. They're both expected to strengthen into hurricanes, potentially complicating the region's efforts to bring the virus under control. Margaret.
 
MARGARET BRENNAN: Mark Strassmann in Atlanta, thank you.
 
We turn now to former FDA Commissioner Doctor Scott Gottlieb, who joins us from Westport, Connecticut. Good morning to you.
 
SCOTT GOTTLIEB, M.D. (Former FDA Commissioner/@ScottGottliebMD): Good morning.
 
MARGARET BRENNAN: New cases have dropped below fifty thousand for about the eighth day. That seems, according to Johns Hopkins, a positive development. But the CDC director says it's really middle America that's getting stuck. Where do you think we are?
 
SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Well, we're seeing some signs of good news here. We're seeing cases fall across the country, across the Sun Belt, where the epidemic was. We're seeing deaths start to fall, and I think we're going to see deaths fall below a thousand a day. They've been persistently at above a thousand a day now for almost four weeks. And we're seeing hospitalizations fall, which is probably the most important indicator to watch. They fell below forty thousand for the first time in a very long time. And this is being driven by declines in the Sun Belt where the coronavirus really was epidemic, the sort of second wave, if you will, of the epidemic, the first being located in the New York Tri-State region. But we're seeing more cases build in the Midwest and the West. And the concern is that if there is sort of a third wave, a third iteration of the national epidemic, it could be more diffuse spread across a broader section of the Midwest and the West, because cases are building in those parts of the country. And that's what's concerning people right now.
 
MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about some of the things that the President has said regarding your old agency, the FDA. Yesterday, he posted a tweet that I want to show our viewers. He said "The deep state, or whoever, over at the FDA is making it very difficult for drug companies to get people in order to test the vaccines and therapeutics. They're hoping to delay the answer until after November 3rd. Most-- must focus on speed." It sounds like the President is directly accusing the FDA of political motivations. What is he talking about?
 
SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Well, I'm not sure exactly what he's talking about, but I can tell you about my direct experience at the agency. I served in that agency three times, twice under President Bush and once as the commissioner for two years under President Trump. And when it comes to regulatory decision-making in that agency, it's a foundational truth that guides that agency as science and a deeply seated sense of public health mission that permeates that agency. It's a part of the esprit de corps of the staff of that agency. And I know that they know the urgency of the moment. They put out sixty guidance documents to find new ways to bring products to the market more quickly. There are seven hundred and fifty drugs under mid or late stages of clinical development, clinical trials right now. So I firmly reject the idea that they would slow walk anything or accelerate anything for that matter, based on any kind of political consideration and any consideration other than what's best for the public health and a real sense of mission to patients.
 
MARGARET BRENNAN: Well--
 
SCOTT GOTTLIEB: As for the clinical trials they-- please.
 
MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the-- the chief of staff to the President doubled down on that today. He says sometimes you have to make them feel the heat if they do not see the light. He said a number of bureaucrats don't see the urgency. What urgency? What-- what-- what is the FDA being pressured to do?
 
SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Well, look, I-- I think a lot of that was about plasma, that tweet, I think the President scoped into that tweet a comment on vaccines. But I will tell you and I sit on the board of Pfizer, one of the two U.S. companies furthest along and developing a vaccine, the vaccine trials have-- have enrolled very fast. Moderna and Pfizer, the two U.S. manufacturers who are the furthest ahead, enrolled twenty-five thousand patients into those trials in the four weeks that those trials have been stood up and they've really only been enrolling in earnest for three weeks. That's extraordinary. So to say that these products aren't moving at really historic pace I think is wrong. The-- there were delays or perceived delays in bringing plasma, authorizing plasma under an emergency use authorization, was reported this week that NIH had misgivings about FDA going forward with that authorization. But there's reasons people have some questions about that. The trial that that's going to be based on, seventy thousand patients, wasn't a very rigorously done trial. It was an open-label study where everyone got treated. So it's hard to draw conclusions. I believe plasma is probably beneficial. It's probably weakly beneficial in the setting of this treatment. But I think some people wanted to see more rigorous data to ground that decision. And I think that's part of what is going on here with respect to that tweet and questions about the FDA decision making.
 
MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay.
 
SCOTT GOTTLIEB: But I think the FDA is on firm ground taking their time to try to closely evaluate that information.
 
MARGARET BRENNAN: The Pre-- the White House has said there will be a major therapeutic breakthrough on the virus announced today. Do you know what that is?
 
SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Well, I would guess it's the emergency use authorization for plasma. You know, the-- the issue here, though, is that patients are getting it. More than seventy thousand patients, again, have been dosed with that. So it's available. What the emergency use authorization will allow is probably more commercial distribution, and it will allow manufacturers of plasma products to more easily recoup the costs. Now, what plasma is is basically taking the antibodies from people who've recovered, so it's a blood product, and infusing them in people who are sick. And if you use it early enough in the course of the disease, there is some precedent for it being beneficial in the treatment of viruses. And so it is a good therapeutic to have in the overall armamentarium. But the bottom line is it's widely available right now, patients are getting it.
 
MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.
 
SCOTT GOTTLIEB: The EUA, the emergency use authorization, will enable probably easier access in certain settings, but it's incremental, and you know, incremental gains--
 
MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay.
 
SCOTT GOTTLIEB: --are important here, but we need to view it for what it is.
 
MARGARET BRENNAN: Quickly, before we let you go, I want to understand this study that came out this week showing from the Journal of Pediatrics that children have a more significant role in community spread than-- than believed initially. Does this mean kids are more contagious than we thought?
 
SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Well, I think this study was consistent with other studies. What it showed-- it was nasopharyngeal swabs, so it was swabs from children comparing them to swabs from adults. There was some problems with this study in that they were swabbing the kids early in the course of the disease, comparing them to adults who were swabbed late in the course of the disease, albeit adults who are very sick, who were hospitalized. And they found that the kids had very high viral levels, in many cases higher than the adults. I think it confirms what other-- other studies have shown, which is that children do shed virus and they can transmit the virus. If they can't transmit the virus, we wouldn't be seeing these outbreaks in day camps in Missouri and Georgia. We saw the situation in Ohio where there was an outbreak in a church service and children were in the chain of transmission. So children can transmit the virus. The presumption is that when they're asymptomatic, they're less likely to transmit it. And that's true of adults too. The CDC says that when adults are asymptomatic, they're also less likely to transmit the infection.
 
MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. Doctor Scott Gottlieb, always good to talk to you. Thank you for your time.
 
We'll be back in a moment.
 
(ANNOUNCEMENTS)
 
MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to Tucson, where classes at the University of Arizona start tomorrow with four instructional options, including in-person learning. Joining us is university president and doctor, Robert Robbins. Good morning to you.
 
DR. ROBERT ROBBINS (University of Arizona President/@UArizonaPres): Good morning, Margaret.
 
MARGARET BRENNAN: Sure. How many students are coming back for in-person, in-class instruction, and will all of them be tested?
 
DR. ROBERT ROBBINS: So all of the students that are living in our dormitories are being tested, that's mandatory. We've tested over five thousand students with twenty-six positives, so it's about 0.3 percent. The other students that are living off-campus are being strongly encouraged to be tested. And in total, there'll be about five thousand students that will be taking essential courses face to face, in person. Those would be things like organic chemistry lab, physics lab, gross anatomy lab, those kind of things. And we think we're going to have about thirty thousand, twenty-eight to thirty thousand students coming back to the Tucson area. Normally, we would have forty-five thousand.
 
MARGARET BRENNAN: And your office told us that the only mandate for testing is for those living on campus. You just mentioned dorms there.
 
DR. ROBERT ROBBINS: Right. Yes.
 
MARGARET BRENNAN: It looks like five thousand of your students live in dorms. That-- that means the majority don't live on campus. So-- so isn't this exposing everyone if you can't mandate testing for those who don't live in a dorm?
 
DR. ROBERT ROBBINS: Well, I think-- I think that what we're going to do is we will try to test everyone that comes on campus. What I would like, and, of course, what we would all like is a ten second-- ten-cent test that we could test everyone every day. We-- we think that we can test everybody who comes back to campus in person, but we can't test them every day using an antigen test, which is what we're using to look at our students that are coming into-- to the dorms. We-- we think that we've got a random testing protocol that we've got in place, but I would like to see us test at least once a week everybody who comes on campus face to face.
 
MARGARET BRENNAN: So Notre Dame mandated testing for students on campus. And I'm sure you know that they have had an outbreak–
 
DR. ROBERT ROBBINS: Yeah.
 
MARGARET BRENNAN: --that has caused them to put things on hold for at least a few weeks. If they tried and failed, why do you think your university will be different?
 
DR. ROBERT ROBBINS: Well, I think that we've got extensive testing policies. I think they did the same thing that we did, which is test students when they came into the dorms, but I'm not sure if they were tested-- because they'd only been in class, just like at UNC Chapel Hill, they'd only been in class for a week or so. I think the big issue is off-campus activity.
 
MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.
 
DR. ROBERT ROBBINS: I think we all know that we can control things in the classroom and on campus and in the student union and not having large gatherings of people on campus in official venues. The problem is, what I've seen is that others such as Kansas, even Arizona State, other universities, Purdue, have gone aggressively off campus to try to break up large gatherings and parties. And that's where most of the transmission has occurred.
 
MARGARET BRENNAN: Would you expel a student if they violated one of your requests? I mean, how do you force people to behave in their own best interest--
 
DR. ROBERT ROBBINS: Yeah.
 
MARGARET BRENNAN: --when they're--
 
DR. ROBERT ROBBINS: Yeah. I--
 
MARGARET BRENNAN: --teenagers and in their early twenties?
 
DR. ROBERT ROBBINS: Sure. No, I understand, and I think we're-- we're so to answer your question first, we've-- we've got a face-covering policy. We're anticipating there'll be some people who refuse to cover their face because of their expression of their individuality and freedom. But that is going to be-- that'll go through the dean of students and code of conduct. And, yes, they can be expelled. What-- what I think we're moving into is we-- we've done a very good job of testing, contact tracing. We've got COVID-19 Watch, which is a Google Apple app that uses Bluetooth. And we're the first university to use that. So, we feel good about our education. And we've been on with a weekly briefing every week and over social media. I think we're-- we're going to continue that preventative therapy and education.
 
MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.
 
DR. ROBERT ROBBINS: But we've got to switch quickly into the treatment mode.
 
MARGARET BRENNAN: When--
 
DR. ROBERT ROBBINS: We know they're going to be spikes in cases, so we've got to be able to handle them.
 
MARGARET BRENNAN: Very quickly, when do you hit the brakes? What's your threshold?
 
DR. ROBERT ROBBINS: When we can't mitigate and handle, if we get overwhelmed with cases where we can't-- don't have enough room for isolation, our hospitals are starting to get capacity-- overcapacity where we can't surge into ICUs--
 
MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.
 
DR. ROBERT ROBBINS: --and if someone were to get really sick. So, we're going to be watching the numbers every day. And if we run out of isolation beds and we can't handle it and people are getting really ill, then-- then we'll pull the plug.
 
MARGARET BRENNAN: Doctor Robbins, thank you for your time.
 
We will be right back.

U.S.
Michelle Obama offers 3 life lessons to Class of 2020 about uncertainty, values and sharing your voice
By Peter Martinez

Updated on: June 7, 2020 / 7:57 PM EDT / CBS News


Barack and Michelle Obama addressed the Class of 2020 on Sunday in a star-studded YouTube livestream that included a joint message of congratulations to students across the world who had their academic lives upended by the coronavirus pandemic. Michelle then took the "virtual stage" to address the Black Lives Matter movement and all its efforts to fight police brutality and racial injustice during the ongoing protests over the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis.

"Our foundation has been shaken not just by a pandemic sending tens of millions to unemployment, but also the age-old fault lines of race and power that we must all grapple with," she said. "It's okay to be confused or don't understand how you're feeling. We're all searching in real time ... We all have no choice but to see what has been staring us in the face for years, for centuries. So, the question is, how will we respond?"

The former first lady also laid out three life lessons for graduates:

"Life will always be uncertain. It is a lesson that most of us get the chance to learn over the course of years and years, even decades, but one you're learning right now."
"In an uncertain world, time-tested values like honesty and integrity ... empathy and compassion. That's the only real currency in life. Treating people right will never fail you."
Share your voice: "For those of you who feel invisible, please know that your story matters. Your ideas matter. Your experience matters. Your vision for what the world can and should be matters. So, don't ever, ever let anyone tell you that you're too angry, or that you should keep your mouth shut. There will always be those who want to keep you silent, to have you be seen but not heard. Maybe they don't even want to see you at all. But those people don't know your story, and if you listen to them, then nothing will ever change."

Michelle also explained how to channel anger for good.

"Graduates, anger is a powerful force. It can be a useful force, but left on its own it will only corrode and destroy and sow chaos on the inside and out. But, when anger is focused, when it's channeled into something more, that is the stuff that changes history," she said. Michelle used the lives of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Sojourner Truth as examples of past leaders who were angry but also "driven by compassion, by principle, by hope."

She also encouraged young people to always challenge the status quo.

"So graduates, it is your time now. And look, our democracy isn't perfect, but I have traveled the world and seen the governments and people in so many other countries, and I can tell you our democracy is sturdy, and yes, it still works. But it doesn't work if you silence yourselves. It does not work if you disengage from the process. And we're seeing the consequences of that right now. But if you hold strong with the same faith that carried all those giants before you toward real, measurable progress, you will change the course of history."

"So, what does that mean for your time?" she asked. "It starts where change always starts: in your own home ... Sometimes it's easier to stand with strangers at a protest than it is to challenge someone in your own backyard. So, if you hear people expressing bigoted views or talking down to 'those people,' it is up to you to call them out. We won't solve anything if we're only willing to do what's easiest."


Dear Class of 2020 (Live stream) by YouTube Originals on YouTube
At the end of her speech, Michelle became emotional: "Here's the thing: I know you can do it, because over these many years, I've seen exactly who you are. I've seen your creativity, and your talent and your resourcefulness. I've seen you speaking out to end gun violence and fight climate change. I've seen you gathering donations for those in need during this pandemic, I've seen you marching with peace and with purpose. And that is why even in tough times like these, you continue to be what gives me hope. Graduates, you all are exactly what we need right now, and for the years and decades to come. You learn so much, so quickly. And not only can do better than those before you — you will. It's your time. I can't wait to see you all take the reigns."

The YouTube livestream also featured a performance of "Pomp and Circumstance" by Lizzo and the New York Philharmonic, plus appearances by Alicia Keys, Justin Timberlake, The Simpsons, Shawn Mendes, Taylor Swift, Billie Eilish, Beyoncé, Bono, BTS, Lady Gaga, Stephen Colbert, Jimmy Kimmel, former Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates, Google and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai, former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Malala Yousafzai.

Mr. Obama also delivered a commencement address of his own Sunday night in which he urged graduates to bring about change. While the former president addressed protests earlier this week during a town hall, this was his first commencement address given since the demonstrations began nationwide. Mr. Obama noted that the U.S. is a nation founded on protests, saying peaceful ones are "patriotic" and that those participating in them are "unbelievably inspiring" and make him "optimistic about our future."

He said the recent protests in response to the killings of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and others, "speak to decades worth of anguish and frustration over unequal treatment and a failure to reform police practices and the broader criminal justice system."

Just as the former first lady did in her speech to graduates, Mr. Obama also mentioned these uncertain times.

"So as scary and uncertain as these times may be, they are also a wake-up call, and they are an incredible opportunity, for your generation," he said. "Because you don't have to accept what was considered normal before. You don't have to accept the world as it is. You can make it into the world as it should be and could be."

Science
Weather experts issue most threatening hurricane forecast yet
By Jeff Berardelli

Updated on: August 6, 2020 / 10:00 PM EDT / CBS News


The 2020 Atlantic hurricane season is racking up storms at breakneck speed. To date, the season is about two weeks ahead of record pace and it's only one third of the way through. On Wednesday, the news became more concerning as the research team at Colorado State University (CSU) — the standard bearer for seasonal forecasts — released the most dire forecast in their 37-year history.

Labeling the 2020 hurricane season "extremely active," the team is now predicting 24 named storms, including 12 total hurricanes and 5 major hurricanes — each figure about double that of a normal season. If the forecast proves accurate, 2020 would be the second most active Atlantic hurricane season, behind only the record-shattering 2005 season which brought Hurricanes Katrina and Wilma.

Only 21 storm names are allotted each year because the letters Q, U, X, Y and Z are not used. As a result, if 24 tropical storms are indeed named, the National Hurricane Center will have to employ the Greek alphabet for overflow. This has only happened one time on record — in 2005 when the Atlantic experienced a total of 28 tropical and subtropical storms.

In addition, CSU is forecasting a 75% chance that the U.S. coast will be struck by a major hurricane — Category 3 or greater — during the 2020 season. This is significant because damage increases exponentially with wind speed. Category 3, 4 and 5 systems cause 85% of all hurricane damage.

On Thursday, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) upgraded its hurricane forecast as well. NOAA's updated outlook calls for 19 to 25 named storms, of which 7 to 11 will become hurricanes, including 3 to 6 major hurricanes. 

"This is one of the most active seasonal forecasts that NOAA has produced in its 22-year history of hurricane outlooks," said U.S. Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross, whose department oversees NOAA. "We encourage all Americans to do their part by getting prepared, remaining vigilant, and being ready to take action when necessary."


Dr. Phil Klotzbach, the lead forecaster of the CSU team, tells CBS News that because the 2020 season is already on a record pace, and conditions remain ripe for activity, the forecast is not particularly far-fetched.


"Honestly, forecasting 15 additional named storms isn't that much of a stretch," he said. "The average season in the active era (from 1995-2019) had 12 additional named storms after August 5."

The last system, Hurricane Isaias, marked the fifth storm to make landfall this season. That's also about two weeks ahead of record pace.


The most obvious contributing factor for such an active season is water temperatures being near historic levels in the Tropical Atlantic, which can act like high-octane fuel to power hurricanes. In the image below, created by UNC-Charlotte graduate student Eric Webb, the darkest red-shaded areas are record warm.

Eric Webb
Some of the hotter-than-normal water may be driven by the warm phase of a natural cycle called the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), a long-accepted concept of warming and cooling. But the scientist who coined the term decades ago, Dr. Michael Mann of Penn State University, now says that new studies provide little support for this cyclical effect.


What is clear is that short-term weather patterns combined with the background warming from human-caused climate change is boosting ocean temperatures. Human warming has increased Tropical Atlantic sea surface temperatures by about 2 degrees Fahrenheit since 1901.

A map showing the change in sea temperature since 1901.
Climate Central
Beyond the hot water, Webb, who specializes in tropical weather, says that rainfall in Africa — where most of the seedlings for tropical systems form before their track across the Atlantic Basin — is way above normal.

"The African Sahel region (between the Congo rainforest to the south and Sahara Desert to the north) has been really wet this summer. A wetter African Sahel means that the waves which create up to 90% of the Atlantic's intense hurricanes are stronger," explains Webb.


While warm waters and a wet African Sahel would already be enough to make for an active season, there are even more factors tipping the scales this season.

In July, atmospheric pressures were at record low levels in the Tropical Atlantic. Areas of low pressure go hand in hand with rising air. That rising air is a requirement for thunderstorms — the foundation for tropical storms — to fire up.


Along with rising air, wind shear, which tends to tear systems apart, is running near record lows this summer.


One factor that can lead to high wind shear in the Atlantic basin is El Niño. But this summer, there is not only an absence of El Niño, but instead the possibility of the opposite phenomenon: La Niña. La Niña's cooler-than-normal Tropical Pacific waters translates into weak winds in the Atlantic Ocean, a perfect setup for an active hurricane season.


As all signs point in an ominous direction, there is one bit of good news in the short term. For the next 10 days, the climate pattern in the Atlantic Basin will be unfavorable for development due to a cyclical pattern passing through. This will give residents of hurricane alley a short window of opportunity to prepare.

More Democratic candidates jumped into the presidential race in 2019 than America has seen since the inception of the modern primary system. Here's a look at all the Democrats who campaigned for a chance to take on President Trump in November 2020.


Michael Bennet
 
Sen. Michael Bennet appears on "CBS This Morning" on Thursday, May 2, 2019

Former vice president and senator from Delaware

Widely known for his tight-knit relationship with President Obama during his time in the White House, Biden also served in Congress for 35 years and ran two previous unsuccessful campaigns for president.
Biden decided to launch an underdog campaign for one of Delaware's Senate seats in 1972, eventually beating a 12-year incumbent. His surprising victory, however, was overshadowed by tragedy. Biden lost his first wife, Neilia Hunter, and 1-year-old daughter, Naomi, to a car crash days before Christmas.
During his long tenure in Congress, Biden solidified himself as one of the most influential members of the Senate, leading the Judiciary and Foreign Affairs Committees during different terms.
Biden sought the Democratic presidential nomination in 1988 and 2008, dropping out during the primary in both. After Biden left the 2008 race, Mr. Obama picked the Delaware senator to be his running mate.
After Mr. Obama's historic election, Biden resigned from the Senate to be sworn in as vice president in 2009. Over the years, he was a loyal advocate for Mr. Obama's policies and the two developed a strong friendship.
In May 2015, his eldest son, Beau, died at age 46 after a battle with brain cancer. Beau's death was one of the reasons his father opted not to run for president in 2016, a decision he has repeatedly said he regrets.
He launched his 2020 bid on April 25, 2019 with a video criticizing President Trump for his response to the Charlottesville riots.
After strong showings in the South Carolina primary and on Super Tuesday he solidified his lead in the Democratic field and prepared to take on President Trump in the fall.

2020 New Laws: Higher minimum wage, gig worker benefits and health-cost caps
evening-news
By Carter Evans

January 1, 2020 / 8:42 PM EST / CBS News


Los Angeles — As the clock struck midnight, there were new laws that took effect across the country. The new decade started with a nice bonus for millions of workers.

Twenty-one states are raising their minimum wage. Florida is raising the state minimum wage $0.10 an hour, while Washington State's minimum wage increased $1.50 to $13.50 an hour.

In California, gig workers, including rideshare and delivery drivers, are now considered employees, making them eligible for paid sick leave and other benefits. Uber and Postmates are challenging the new law in court. On Tuesday, a federal judge temporarily blocked the law from impacting more than 70,000 independent truckers.

To help combat skyrocketing drug costs, Colorado is the first state to put a $100 copay cap on a monthly supply of insulin.  

In California, natural hairstyles, like afros, braids, and dreadlocks are now legally protected. This follows recent incidents, nationwide, of African Americans  being unfairly targeted because of their hair.


Starting Wednesday, all new houses built in California must have solar panels, a significant energy savings, but it also will add almost $10,000 to the cost of construction.

Washington is now the fifth state to raise the minimum age to 21 for buying tobacco or vaping products. That could also be a federal law later this year. Illinois now joins 10 other states in legalizing the use of recreational marijuana.

Also in Illinois, it is now illegal to stream video while driving, proving that some laws are designed to protect us from ourselves.

Top global risk in 2020? It's American politics, experts say
moneywatch
By Aimee Picchi

January 6, 2020 / 3:53 PM EST / MoneyWatch


As investors assess the threat of increasingly hostile relations between the U.S. and Iran, Eurasia Group says the conflict isn't the biggest threat facing global economic and political stability this year. Instead, the top risk in 2020 is likely to be America's politics. 

"It's the first time in history of our firm that a domestic political risk is No. 1," said Ian Bremmer, president of the political risk consultancy, in a conference call to discuss the geopolitical advisory firm's annual risk-assessment forecast. The firm started in 1998, he noted. 

At the heart of the issue is the November presidential election, with Bremmer predicting that many Americans will view the results as illegitimate no matter the outcome. The Senate is likely to acquit President Donald Trump in his forthcoming impeachment trial, heightening political tensions in an already polarized nation, he added. In a close election this fall, the losing side will claim the results were "rigged," leading to instability and legal challenges, Bremmer said.

"Meaningful [France-style] social discontent becomes more likely in that environment, as does domestic, politically inspired violence," Eurasia Group wrote in an analysis issued on Monday.

In addition, legislation could stall because of what the firm called a "non-functioning Congress," adding to mounting problems if the economy slows down, according to the Eurasia report.


China headwinds
The second biggest risk for 2020 is one that has been in the headlines throughout the past year, according to Eurasia: The decision by China to reduce its technological dependence on the U.S. following Mr. Trump's trade war with the country. 

"Caught off-guard by U.S. actions, President Xi Jinping has called for a new 'Long March' to break China's technological dependence on the U.S.," the report noted. "At the same time, China will expand efforts to reshape international technology, trade and financial architecture to better promote its interests in an increasingly bifurcated world."

That represents a shift away from decades of globalization, Bremmer said. He added that "very soon" the world's largest economy may no longer be America's capitalist system, but China's hybrid of state control and capitalism. 

Iran: Not at the top of the list
The threat of deteriorating U.S.-Iran relations ranks at No. 8, Eurasia Group said. That's partly because Bremmer said his group doesn't believe a full-scale military response will evolve from the U.S. killing of General Qassem Soleimani, the head of Iran's elite Quds military force and one of the most powerful figures in the Islamic Republic. 


"Iran is a committed adversary of the United States but also has a clear understanding of U.S. military power … as well as (now) a better sense of Trump's red lines and deterrence capacity," the report noted. 

Below is Eurasia Group's list of the top 10 risks for 2020.

U.S. domestic politics: As noted above, a polarized nation is heading into an election that could be contested by both sides, leading to legislative and economic challenges. 
"The Great Decoupling": China and the U.S. are cutting their technological ties, leading to disruptions in the globalization of trade and business.
U.S.-China tensions: As conflict between the U.S. and China festers, economic and security tensions will intensify. 
The waning influence of multinational companies: Regulatory and trade restrictions will lessen big companies' ability to generate wealth, growth and jobs. 
Pressure on India's Narendra Modi: Sectarian and religious conflicts are growing in India, which is facing a precarious fiscal situation. 
The European Union pulls away: The EU is growing more independent, which creates regulatory and economic risks for other countries. 
The politics versus economics of climate change: Political solutions to climate change aren't working, which increases the risks of economic disruptions and political instability. 
Tensions with Iran and the Middle East: "U.S. policy toward the major Shia-led nations in the Middle East is failing," increasing the risks of regional instability and higher gas prices, Eurasia Group said.
Latin America's instability: Citizens in Latin American countries are angry about issues ranging from corruption to low-quality public services. That and other pressures are increasing risks across the region. 
Turkey: "President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has entered a period of steep political decline ... This year, his weakness will lead him to lash out. The response will further damage Turkey's already ailing economy," the group predicted.

2020 turning out to be deadliest year ever in U.S., mainly due to COVID-19
December 22, 2020 / 4:31 AM EST / AP


This is the deadliest year in U.S. history, with deaths expected to top 3 million for the first time — due mainly to the coronavirus pandemic. Final mortality data for this year won't be available for months, but preliminary numbers suggest the United States is on track to see more than 3.2 million deaths this year, or at least 400,000 more than in 2019.

U.S. deaths increase most years, so some annual rise in fatalities is expected. But the 2020 numbers amount to a jump of about 15% and could go higher once all the deaths from this month are counted.

That would mark the largest single-year percentage leap since 1918, when tens of thousands of U.S. soldiers died in World War I and hundreds of thousands of Americans died in a flu pandemic. Deaths rose 46% that year compared with 1917.

COVID-19 has killed more than 319,000 Americans and counting. Before it came along, there was reason to be hopeful about U.S. death trends.

The nation's overall mortality rate fell a bit in 2019, due to reductions in heart disease and cancer deaths. And life expectancy inched up - by several weeks - for the second straight year, according to death certificate data released Tuesday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

But life expectancy for 2020 could end up dropping as much as three full years, said Robert Anderson of the CDC.

The agency counted 2,854,838 U.S. deaths last year, or nearly 16,000 more than 2018. That's fairly good news: Deaths usually rise by about 20,000 to 50,000 each year, mainly due to the nation's aging, and growing, population.

Indeed, the age-adjusted death rate dropped about 1% in 2019, and life expectancy rose by about six weeks to 78.8 years, the CDC reported.

"It was actually a pretty good year for mortality, as things go," said Anderson, who oversees CDC death statistics.

The U.S. coronavirus epidemic has been a big driver of deaths this year, both directly and indirectly.

The virus was first identified in China last year, and the first U.S. cases were reported this year. But it has become the third leading cause of death, behind only heart disease and cancer. For certain periods this year, COVID-19 was the No. 1 killer.

But some other types of deaths also have increased.

A burst of pneumonia cases early this year may have been COVID-19 deaths that simply weren't recognized as such early in the epidemic. But there also have been an unexpected number of deaths from certain types of heart and circulatory diseases, diabetes and dementia, Anderson said.

Many of those, too, may be related to COVID. The virus could have weakened patients already struggling with those conditions, or could have diminished the care they were getting, he said.

Early in the epidemic, some were optimistic that car crash deaths would drop as people stopped commuting or driving to social events. Data on that is not yet in, but anecdotal reports suggest there was no such decline.

Suicide deaths dropped in 2019 compared with 2018, but early information suggests they have not continued to drop this year, Anderson and others said.

Drug overdose deaths, meanwhile, got much worse.

Before the coronavirus even arrived, the U.S. was in the midst of the deadliest drug overdose epidemic in its history.

Data for all of 2020 is not yet available. But the CDC reported last week that there were more than 81,000 drug overdose deaths in the 12 months ending in May, making it the highest number ever recorded in a one-year period.

Experts think the pandemic's disruption to in-person treatment and recovery services may have been a factor. People also are more likely to be taking drugs alone - without the benefit of a friend or family member who can call 911 or administer overdose-reversing medication.

But perhaps a bigger factor are the drugs themselves: COVID-19 caused supply problems for dealers, so they are increasingly mixing cheap and deadly fentanyl into heroin, cocaine and methamphetamine, experts said.

"I don't suspect there are a bunch of new people who suddenly started using drugs because of COVID. If anything, I think the supply of people who are already using drugs is more contaminated," said Shannon Monnat, a Syracuse University researcher who studies drug overdose trends.

Julián Castro drops out of 2020 presidential race
By Grace Segers

January 2, 2020 / 6:22 PM EST / CBS News


Washington — Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro is dropping out of the presidential race, he announced in a video released by his campaign on Thursday.

"With only a month before the Iowa caucuses, and given the circumstances of this campaign season, I have determined that it simply isn't our time," Castro said in the video. "So today it is with a heavy heart and profound gratitude that I will suspend my campaign for president."


Castro, who served as mayor of San Antonio for five years before joining the Obama administration in 2014, struggled to find a foothold in a crowded Democratic primary field and lagged behind other candidates in terms of fundraising. In November, the campaign eliminated field offices in New Hampshire and South Carolina, and Castro failed to meet the threshold to appear at the most recent debate in December.

Castro, the only Latino candidate in the race, focused his campaign on issues like immigration, poverty and police brutality. In the video announcing the end of his campaign, Castro stressed his advocacy for the "most vulnerable folks in this country" and referenced the names of several black Americans killed by police officers in recent years.

His campaign noted he was the first candidate to travel to Puerto Rico as part of his campaign, and the first to publicly support opening an impeachment inquiry against President Trump.

In perhaps the most memorable moment of his bid, Castro clashed with former Vice President Joe Biden over health care during a debate in September. In a heated exchange, Castro suggested repeatedly that Biden had forgotten what he had just said. "Are you forgetting what you said two minutes ago?" Castro asked, a thinly veiled reference to Biden's gaffes that critics have attributed to his age.

Castro was reportedly on the short list to be Hillary Clinton's pick for vice president in 2016, and could once again be among those considered as a running mate for the eventual Democratic nominee in 2020. Reacting to his decision to drop out, Senator Elizabeth Warren called Castro a "powerful voice" who "will continue to be a leader in our party and our country for many years to come."

Castro's announcement on Thursday comes as other Democratic candidates announced huge fundraising hauls in the fourth quarter of 2019. Pete Buttigieg announced that his campaign raised $24.7 million in the fourth quarter, while Bernie Sanders raised $34 million.

The video announcing his departure ends with Castro saying "ganaremos un día," or, "we will win one day."

Swalwell 'Close To Making A Decision' On Potential 2020 Presidential Run
sanfrancisco
January 30, 2019 / 2:58 PM PST / CBS San Francisco


WASHINGTON (CBS SF) – Rep. Eric Swalwell, who represents the East Bay in Congress, said he is nearing a decision about a potential run for the White House in 2020.

"I'm close to making a decision. I'll be in New Hampshire tomorrow, so I'm excited for that," Swalwell told CNN as he walked off the House floor Wednesday.

On his trip in New Hampshire, Swalwell said, he hopes to "talk to Granite Staters about what their idea of the future of America is" and "how (his) ideas could work and lift up their vision and aspirations."

Swalwell hinted at a possible presidential run last summer and has often visited early primary states such as Iowa and New Hampshire in the past two years.

"I do think that though our country's path forward is through a candidate who can bring new energy, new ideas and new leadership, new confidence to solve these problems," he said before an event with constituents in Fremont last August.

Swalwell, 38, has represented his district covering parts of Alameda and Contra Costa counties since 2013.

Last month, Swalwell made headlines when he told CNN's Wolf Blitzer that he would be open to running on a ticket with former Vice President Joe Biden, with the former Delaware senator either leading the ticket or being Swalwell's vice presidential pick.

If he decides to run, Swalwell would join a crowded field of Democrats seeking to unseat President Donald Trump and would not be the only candidate from the Bay Area. Sen. Kamala Harris officially kicked off her campaign with a rally in Oakland on Sunday.

Last year, the representative did not appear deterred about a long list of challengers.

"We're going to have 15 to 20 people run, that is probably the best thing about this. I think crowded primaries flush out weaknesses and leaders emerge," Swalwell said at the time.

Most CFOs see a U.S. recession coming by 2020
moneywatch
By Kate Gibson

Updated on: December 12, 2018 / 11:23 AM EST / MoneyWatch


Considering that major corporations have been busy shedding workers, it follows that corporate finance leaders see a U.S. recession ahead. Evidence of a slowing economy has been popping up, including recent large-scale cuts in head count by U.S. corporations such as General Motors and Verizon.

Eighty-two percent of chief financial officers polled believe a recession will have started by the end 2020, and nearly 49 percent think the downturn will arrive sometime next year, according to the Duke University/CFO Global Business Outlook, released Wednesday. 

"The end is near for the near-decade-long burst of global economic growth," said John Graham, a finance professor at Duke's Fuqua School of Business and director of the survey. "The U.S. outlook has declined, and moreover the outlook is even worse in many other parts of the world, which will lead to softer demand for U.S. goods."

Worst-case projections would see capital spending drop in 2019, accompanied by flat hiring, found the survey conducted Friday of more than 500 CFOs, including 226 from North America.

Global agreement
CFOs were also pessimistic in other regions of the world, especially in Africa, where 97 percent said they believe their countries will be in recession no later than year-end 2019, the survey found.

"CFOs are getting ready for a recession in the next 18 months," said Campbell Harvey, a founding director of the survey and technology innovation professor at Fuqua. "All of the ingredients are in place: a waning expansion that began in June 2009 -- almost a decade ago -- heightened market volatility, the impact of growth-reducing protectionism and the ominous flattening of the yield curve, which has predicted recessions accurately over the past 50 years."


The Duke findings align with other signals indicating that some companies are girding for a slowdown. More than a half-million U.S. workers have been laid off so far this year, a 28 percent higher pace than this time last year, according to consultancy Challenger Gray & Christmas. 

A gloomy forecast could also be heard in recent corporate explanations of cutbacks. GM Chairman and CEO Mary Barra said the automaker opted to close five plants and lay off tens of thousands of workers to "stay in front of market conditions."

Glass half-full
Yet some economists give decidedly different odds of a recession hitting, at least in 2019. Oxford Economics' bond market-influenced "yield-curve model" puts the odds of a recession around 15 percent during the next 12 months, the firm said in a research note. Factoring in the dangers of a policy-induced economic slowdown raises the chances. In that case, Oxford Economics pegs odds of a recession at about 20 percent in 2019 and 35 percent in 2020.

Others also don't see a recession around every corner. Higher interest rates and the waning effects of this year's corporate tax cuts have helped fuel stock-market losses and push Treasury yield curves to 11-year lows, while jobless claims have edged up amid consensus views the economy will slow next year, noted Joseph LaVorgna, chief economist for the Americas at Natixis. Still, "for now, we remain optimistic on the economy," LaVorgna wrote in a research note Tuesday, "projecting a continuation of above-trend economic activity."

Bloomberg taking steps to enter 2020 Democratic presidential race
By Ed O'Keefe

November 7, 2019 / 10:40 PM EST / CBS News


Washington — Michael Bloomberg is taking steps to enter the 2020 Democratic presidential campaign, a person familiar with his plans tells CBS News.

Bloomberg, 77, has dispatched aides to Alabama to file paperwork in the state to run as a Democrat. The Cotton State doesn't hold an early Democratic presidential primary, but has the earliest filing deadline for the presidential campaign. Taking steps to file paperwork is the most serious signal yet that the former New York mayor and billionaire is seriously planning for a White House run.

The New York Times first reported Bloomberg's plans to file to run in Alabama.

Howard Wolfson, a longtime Bloomberg adviser, said in a statement that Bloomberg "is increasingly concerned that the current field of candidates is not well positioned" to defeat President Trump.

"If Mike runs he would offer a new choice to Democrats built on a unique record running America's biggest city, building a business from scratch and taking on some of America's toughest challenges as a high-impact philanthropist," Wolfson said. "Based on his record of accomplishment, leadership and his ability to bring people together to drive change, Mike would be able to take the fight to Trump and win."

In an interview with "Face the Nation" moderator Margaret Brennan in late October, Bloomberg expressed his reservations about the Democratic field.

"I have my reservations about the people running and their campaigning, the promises they're making that they can't fulfill, and their willingness to admit what is possible and what isn't and their inconsistency from day to day," he said. "This is not the way to run a railroad."

Authentic wins 2020 Kentucky Derby
By Jordan Freiman

Updated on: September 5, 2020 / 7:19 PM EDT / CBS News

Authentic on Saturday won the 146th Kentucky Derby, denying Tiz the Law a shot at the Triple Crown. Tiz the Law came into the race as the favorite at 4/5 odds.

The Run for the Roses, usually the first leg of the Triple Crown, was pushed back due to the coronavirus pandemic. Instead, the Belmont Stakes, the traditional last race in the Triple Crown, was held first this year. Tiz the Law won that race on June 20, becoming the first New York-bred horse to win the contest since 1882.

Authentic was trained by Hall of Famer Bob Baffert, who has trained two Triple Crown winners. Baffert now has six Kentucky Derby wins, tying him for the all-time record with Ben A. Jones, who also trained two Triple Crown winners.

The final Triple Crown race this year will be the Preakness Stakes, scheduled for October 3.

Like the Belmont Stakes, Saturday's contest was held without fans in attendance. Multiple protests converged outside Churchill Downs prior to the race, however. According to CBS affiliate WLKY-TY, the group Until Freedom is marching and demanding the officers involved in the shooting death of Breonna Taylor be charged and arrested. Another group, NFAC, which WLKY characterized as a "Black militia" is also protesting.

The protests were met by "back the blue" counter protesters at Jefferson Square Park in downtown Louisville before the groups began marching to Churchill Downs.

Trump holds last 2020 MAGA rally; Biden sweeps tiny NH town

President Trump held his last 2020 campaign rally well after midnight on Election Day in Michigan after a marathon day of campaigning in swing states on Monday. Joe Biden had wrapped a few hours earlier after barnstorming Pennsylvania, a critically important state to both parties. 

Biden swept all five votes in the tiny New Hampshire town of Dixville Notch, which votes at the stroke of midnight on Election Day and is the first to report its results. Mr. Trump won in nearby Millsfield, which also casts its ballots at midnight, with the president taking 16 votes to Biden's 5. 

In Texas, where early voter turnout surpassed the total voter turnout in 2016, a federal judge on Monday rejected a lawsuit filed by four Republicans seeking to prevent officials from counting nearly 127,000 votes cast at drive-thru polling locations in the Houston area. Hours after the judge's order was filed Monday, Harris County Clerk Chris Hollins announced that nine of the county's 10 drive-thru polling locations would be closed Tuesday. Hollins claimed the closures were enacted to protect ballots from being thrown out.

As of Monday, 97 million Americans nationwide had already voted, suggesting there will be record turnout at the polls this year. CBS News has compiled a full list of what time the polls close in each state here.

Trump wraps final 2020 MAGA campaign rally after 1 a.m. on Election Day
 President Trump wrapped his final 2020 campaign rally at 1:13 a.m. on Election Day in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Mr. Trump hit his usual campaign points, and when he asked the crowd who had already voted, he said "good, save it for Tuesday." 

The rapper Lil' Pump, whom Mr. Trump called "one of the big superstars of the world," was invited onstage, although Mr. Trump  mistakenly referred to him as "Little Pimp." 

"I've come here to say, Mr. President, I appreciate everything you have done for our country," Lil' Pump said. "You brought the troops home, you're doing the right thing. MAGA 20 20 20, don't forget that!" 

Mr. Trump also recounted his victory in 2016, saying that on election night, "we came home late and we watched a beautiful victory. And we're going to have another beautiful victory tomorrow."

Harris County clerk says only 1 drive-thru location will be open Tuesday
Hours after a federal judge dismissed a bid by Republicans to throw out ballots from drive-thru polling locations in Harris County, Clerk Chris Hollins announced that nine of the county's 10 drive-thru polling locations would be closed Tuesday, the final day of voting for this year's election. 

Hollins wrote in a series of tweets that Hanen's order left the door open for challenges to votes cast Tuesday at all but one drive-thru location. Hanen wrote Tuesday that Texas election law allows for "movable structures" as early voting locations — which he said the tents used to how drive-thru ballot boxes qualify as — but not for election day locations. 

"In order to allow for drive-thru voting on Election Day while ensuring that all votes will be counted, the only drive-thru voting center on Election Day will be at Toyota Center," Hollins tweeted Tuesday night, referring to the arena home of the NBA's Houston Rockets.

"I know that drive-thru voting is a safe and convenient option for Harris County voters, but we also have 800 walk-in voting centers available for Election Day that we have worked tirelessly to make safe for voters and election workers," Hollins said.

Harris County's drive-thru sites are all located near to in-person voting locations.

Biden sweeps all 5 votes in tiny Dixville Notch
 All five voters in the tiny New Hampshire town of Dixville Notch, which is the first town to vote in the country, cast their ballots for Joe Biden. The vote was held at the stroke of midnight.


Les Otten, who said he was a lifelong Republican, cast the first ballot for Biden. "I don't agree with him on a lot of issues, but I believe it's time to find what unites us, not what divides us," he said in a video posted to Dixville Vote's Twitter feed.

"My vote today is meant to send a message to my fellow Republicans that our party can find its way back," he said. "It's time to return to the values that our conservative government holds dear."

Trump jokes about not paying staffer trying to fix mic
President Trump held his second-to-last rally of the 2020 campaign in Kenosha, Wisconsin, where there was a microphone problem. That led to Mr. Trump venting about "the worst microphone I've ever used in my entire life." 

"And we're supposed to pay these people, right?" Mr. Trump quipped of the audio staff after his podium microphone let out a screech. At one point, the president walked to the end of the stage, grabbed another handheld mic, then promptly polled the audience about which microphone sounded better. The consensus was unclear, but eventually the handheld microphone won out.  

"I'm always saying, I want a perfect mic," Mr. Trump noted. After a staffer came on stage to try and fix the president's microphone, the president said, "I don't like to pay bills when people do a bad job." He eventually relented. "They come from Kenosha so I'm going to pay the bill anyway. What the hell."

Kenosha is the site of civil unrest this summer after police shot Jacob Blake, a Black man, seven times. A White teen is accused of opening fire at protests over Blake's shooting, killing two people and wounding a third. 

At Monday's rally, Mr. Trump mentioned the unrest this summer by noting he had been there over the summer.  "You were in the news, right? You were in the news," he said. He also lamented seeing businesses board up in anticipation of violence after Election Day.

Joe Biden held his final campaign rally in Pittsburgh on Monday night, finishing out the 2020 campaign with an upbeat message. 

"Folks, I have a feeling we're coming together for a big win tomorrow," Biden said. He added that "tomorrow is the beginning of a new day" and there is "nothing that is gonna stop this nation from voting."

Biden also stressed that he will not ban fracking, after President Trump has repeatedly insisted Biden is against fracking. Fracking has been central to the economy of western Pennsylvania, where Pittsburgh is located.

Nevada GOP "evaluating an expedited appeal" after judge denies appeal to pause counting ballots in Clark County
Nevada Republicans say they are "evaluating an expedited appeal" to the battleground state's highest court after a lower court judge on Monday filed an opinion denying their joint plea with Mr. Trump's campaign to pause the counting of early ballots in Clark County, the state's most populous. 

Democrats in the state have repeatedly decried the GOP's complaints around the county's handling of election observers and mail ballots, and Nevada Attorney General Aaron Ford in a statement Monday denounced the case as part of "the president's deliberate attempts to undermine Nevada's elections."

In his order denying the Republicans' petition, Nevada District Judge James Wilson said "the above-cited statutes created observers not counters, validators, or auditors. Allowing such access creates a host of problems."

Federal judge rejects GOP effort to toss 127,000 ballots in Texas
A federal judge on Monday dismissed a lawsuit filed by four Republicans seeking to prevent officials from counting about 127,000 votes cast at drive-thru polling locations in the Houston area.

The lawsuit asked a judge to invalidate votes cast at the drive-thru sites. Harris County's 10 drive-thru locations were established as part of an effort to limit the spread of coronavirus.

Judge Andrew Hanen's ruling comes just over a day before voting concludes in the presidential election, and a day after the Texas Supreme Court denied a similar petition seeking to block Harris County's drive-thru votes filed by the same group of Republicans. The Texas Supreme Court already rejected a similar case last month.

In delivering his decision in court just half an hour after hearing arguments, Hanen criticized the timing of the lawsuit.

"I don't find it timely. (Planning for drive-thru voting) has been going on basically all summer," Hanen said. "And then at least since October 16, people have actually, I think it's the 16th, have been voting. And to file it late last week, I find that not to be timely and that therefore the likelihood of success does not weigh."

He said the plaintiffs did not adequately argue why, even if Harris County's plan was not permissible, voters should be punished. 

"They voted according to the statute as far as they're concerned, that also weighs into balancing the harms. We have over 120,000 people that have already voted. With the vast, vast, vast majority of those did that in reliance on their public officials telling them that this was legal and this was the right way to vote and that it had been sanctioned," Hanen said.

Biden campaign outlines paths to victory on Election Day
Biden's top campaign officials held a briefing to detail their expectations for election night, outlining Biden's paths to victory and denouncing reports that the president might prematurely declare victory while millions of votes remain to be counted.

"It was reported yesterday that President Trump believes that if he wins the East Coast battleground states — Florida, North Carolina and Georgia — he plans to go out and declare victory. And we want to be clear with you — if he tries to do that, that will not be true," campaign manager Jen O'Malley Dillon said. "Under no scenario will Donald Trump be declared a victor on election night, and we think that's really fundamental to how we want to approach tomorrow."

O'Malley Dillon said Biden holds a "significant advantage" heading into Election Day, given his lead among early voters. "Leads like ours and what we're seeing will be difficult to overcome," she said, pointing to leads in states like North Carolina, Wisconsin and Arizona.

"What it means for Election Day is that, with our advantage coming into North Carolina, where we estimate about 87% of the projected vote is already in, we believe that Trump is going to need 62% of the votes on Election Day in order to win," O'Malley Dillon said, noting the campaign estimates that figure to be 61% and 60% in Wisconsin and Arizona, respectively.

"We know that all the ballots aren't going to be reported on election night, and in fact, that's not just our supporters, that's going to be his supporters, too," she said. "It's also going to be our military overseas who have turned in their ballots. It's also going to be our COVID frontline workers ... We believe every vote should be counted, as it always has been."

O'Malley Dillon outlined various ways Biden could win the 270 electoral votes needed to secure the White House, saying the president "has a very narrow path to win." 

"We can get to 270 without Florida, which is a significant advantage," she added, saying the campaign would still have "a clear and viable path" to 270 even if Mr. Trump wins Florida and North Carolina, both of which will begin reporting results earlier. That path runs through Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, which O'Malley Dillon said was also the former vice president's "easiest" path to victory.

Campaign adviser Bob Bauer detailed the campaign's election protection program and said it has seen "minimal'' incidents of voters reporting difficulties exercising their right to vote.

The Biden campaign, he said, has deployed thousands of poll observers to assist election officials with identifying and addressing issues that may arise at the polls. Like O'Malley Dillon, Bauer dismissed the notion that Mr. Trump could declare himself the victor Tuesday night.

"It is absurd for the president to suggest there is any significance at all to his declaring victory on election night," Bauer said. "He has no constitutional legal right to declare himself the president."

"When you hear the noise out of election night from the direction of Donald Trump, if you read the tweets, if you read the tweets of some of his supporters echoing what he is saying, just ignore it. There's nothing to it," he continued.

Addressing potential legal challenges that may arise after Election Day, Bauer said the Biden campaign is "fully prepared" for any "legal hijinx" from the Trump campaign.

"I think it's very telling that President Trump is focused not on his voters but on his lawyers, and his lawyers are not going to win the election for him, there's no question about it," he said. "The case he's turning over to his lawyers when the voters have spoken is a case that no lawyer can win and his lawyers will not win it. We're going to match them, I assure you, and exceed them in quality and vigor and we'll protect the vote."

Justice Department sending monitors to 18 states ensure compliance with federal voting laws
The Justice Department announced its Civil Rights Division will dispatch personnel to 44 jurisdictions in 18 states to "monitor for compliance with the federal voting rights laws" on Election Day. 

This year, staff will be sent to counties and cities in the following states: Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Texas, Virginia and Wisconsin. A full list of jurisdictions can be found here.

The Justice Department's move is not out of the ordinary. For the 2016 general election, the department deployed more than 500 employees to 67 jurisdictions in 28 states, and for Election Day in 2012, the Justice Department sent more than 780 observers and personnel to 51 jurisdictions in 23 states.

Biden rebukes Trump's attacks on Fauci: "Elect me and I'm going to hire Dr. Fauci"
Addressing supporters at a drive-in rally in Cleveland, a last-minute addition to his campaign schedule, Biden lambasted the president for his handling of the coronavirus pandemic and said the first step toward defeating the virus is denying Mr. Trump a second term.

"This guy is a disgrace," the former vice president said of the president.

Responding to Mr. Trump's suggestion Sunday at a rally in Opa-locka, Florida, that he may fire Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's leading infectious disease expert, after the election, Biden said he will ensure Fauci remains in government if he wins the White House.

"Elect me and I'm going to hire Dr. Fauci and we're going to fire Donald Trump," Biden said.

The former vice president drew contrasts between his own middle class upbringing in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and Claymont, Delaware, with Mr. Trump's childhood in a wealthy neighborhood in Queens.

"It's about time a guy from a state university graduated into the White House because if I'm there, you're going to be there, too," Biden, who graduated from the University of Delaware, said.

Trump planning election night festivities at the White House
A senior administration official told CBS News that Mr. Trump is planning to host an election night party at the White House. Roughly 400 guests have been invited, though it's unlikely all will attend, the official said.

The party is expected to take place on the State Floor of the White House, which includes the East Room. While other festivities are set to take place around the nation's capital, it's unclear whether the president will appear at any other election night parties.

Republicans express concerns about Georgia
Some Republicans are concerned about the Peach State, which Mr. Trump won easily in 2016 but could spell trouble for him this year.

One plugged-in GOP donor in Georgia who has seen party battleground internal polls says Republicans have "lots of worries" about Georgia. 

Another Republican staffer on Capitol Hill said that Republicans are feeling weak-kneed about the state. This source said to keep an eye on the Senate race between Democrat Jon Ossoff and Republican Senator David Perdue. It's possible that Perdue does poorly and drags Mr. Trump down with him, the person said. 

Voting in Georgia has already surpassed 2016 turnout, and high turnout usually means good things for Democrats. 

The Georgia GOP donor pointed to swelling Black and Latino populations in the state, along with GOP Governor Brian Kemp's unpopularity and strong get-out-the-vote efforts from Democrats. 

"There's a reason that President Trump made time for his Rome, Georgia, stop last night," the donor said.

DNC touts success of "IWillVote" initiative, releases new digital ad with Billie Jean King
The Democratic National Committee (DNC) is hailing the success of its voting initiative "IWillVote," revealing that its website iwillvote.com has attracted 18,599,788 individual visitors so far this year. With one day until Election Day, the DNC is also releasing a new digital ad featuring tennis legend Billie Jean King, urging Americans to vote if they haven't yet done so. The ad will run in key battleground states.

In the ad, King referenced the record turnout of Americans who have voted early. In a final push, King asks viewers to "help us make this election have the highest turnout in American history. Be a history maker — vote on Election Day."

Throughout the campaign, the DNC has released ads on various platforms featuring figures like former President Obama and "Hamilton" star Leslie Odom, Jr., directing people to the IWillVote website for more information on how and where to cast their ballots. Mr. Obama plugged the website in person at a rally in Flint, Michigan, on October 31.

"Just go to iwillvote.com," Mr. Obama said. "Find your polling place, get out there and vote."

The DNC's "I Will Vote" website provided voters with educational resources to identify vote-by-mail and early voting deadlines in their states. The website also gave voters the opportunity to request a ballot via email specific to their state, to print a vote-by-mail request form and to request an envelope with prepaid postage.

The site attracted its highest level of traffic on October 8, the night of the vice presidential debate between Vice President Mike Pence and Senator Kamala Harris. Nearly 1.7 million people visited the site, totaling more than 2.2 million page views, according to a DNC official. During the debate, Harris mentioned the website.

The DNC official noted that 507,703 people started the voter registration process through the website this year, and 636,358 people utilized the website to request a vote-by-mail application or to learn how to vote by mail in their state.

Politics
Puerto Rico governor looks to move up 2020 Democratic primary
By Camilo Montoya-Galvez

June 12, 2019 / 3:06 PM EDT / CBS News


Washington — Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rosselló is spearheading an effort to move up the date of the island's 2020 Democratic primary to highlight the pressing issues facing the U.S. territory, which some progressives worry are being neglected on the campaign trail. 

The measure, which is expected to pass the island's legislature in the coming weeks, would move the primary from the first Sunday in June to the last Sunday in March. Rosselló said the change would incentivize the two-dozen Democrats running for president to actively address proposals to remedy some of the island's woes, including stalled hurricane recovery efforts and a prolonged fiscal crisis. 

"You have a platform there in Puerto Rico to really zero in. It can be kind of the ground zero of the discussions of some of the issues that are important for the Democratic candidates," the governor told CBS News during an exclusive interview in Washington. "And I hope — and I expect — others to come to the island."

If the measure passes as expected, Rosselló said Democratic presidential campaigns will make more an effort to win over the state's delegates. In 2016, Puerto Rico had 67 Democratic delegates in play, more than than over two dozen states and territories.  

The governor is also pushing the Democratic National Committee (DNC) to hold a presidential debate in Puerto Rico and said a formal request will be forthcoming.

Rosselló said Puerto Rico — home to approximately 3.2 million U.S. citizens — can serve as a microcosm of issues that affect the entire nation but that are particularly pronounced on the island. "These issues that are important to all of the candidates that resonate in Iowa, in New Hampshire, in California and elsewhere, they resonate in Puerto Rico," he added. 

The governor said the "extreme" economic inequality on the island — which is the highest of any U.S. state or territory, based on the most widely recognized measure of income inequality — can help candidates highlight the issue of wealth disparity across the country.

On climate change, Rosselló said Puerto Rico can become a "model" for national efforts to reduce carbon emissions and expand renewable energy. He said the Caribbean island, unlike most areas in the mainland U.S., has felt the brunt of human-induced climate change by way of rising sea levels, severe droughts and powerful storms, like the pair that pummeled the U.S. territory in 2017. 

Rosselló, an ardent supporter of Puerto Rican statehood, also believes the island represents the most compelling example of voter disenfranchisement in the U.S. 

U.S. citizens in Puerto Rico can't vote in the general presidential election, as the island does not have electoral votes, unlike the District of Columbia, which also lacks voting representation in Congress but was granted electoral votes under the 23rd Amendment. Puerto Ricans who move to the mainland and register, however, can cast ballots in general elections. 

Under the 1979 Guaranteed Presidential Vote U.S. citizens in Puerto Rico Act, U.S. citizens on the island can vote in party primaries. 

"What better place to sort of highlight the effects of voter disenfranchisement than in Puerto Rico where you have 3.2 million U.S. citizens that are just disenfranchised?" Rosselló asked.



Face The Nation
Transcript: Dr. Anthony Fauci on "Face the Nation," February 16, 2020
face-the-nation
February 16, 2020 / 11:25 AM EST / CBS News


The following is a transcript of an interview with Dr. Anthony Fauci that aired Sunday, February 16, 2020, on "Face the Nation."

MARGARET BRENNAN: Joining us now is Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at NIH. Dr. Fauci, it's good to have you here. 

DR. ANTHONY FAUCI: Good to be with you. 

MARGARET BRENNAN: We were just hearing about the State Department sending planes to help evacuate some of these Americans who were on that cruise ship. Debora said more than 40 now. What can you tell us in terms of the Americans have been exposed and infected?

DR. FAUCI: Well, 40 of them have gotten infected. They are not going to go anywhere. They're going to be in hospitals in Japan. People who have symptoms will not be able to get on the evacuation plane. Others are going to be evacuated starting imminently to Air Force bases in the United States. If people on the plane start to develop symptoms, they'll be segregated within the plane. So there's a very firm plan with this 747 that is going to take these passengers now who have been there. If you want to stay in Japan, your last chance would be to get on the plane and leave or you stay there. When you come back to the United States, importantly, they're still subjected to a 14 day quarantine. And the reason for that is that the degree of transmissibility on that cruise ship is essentially akin to being in a hot spot. A lot of transmissibility on that cruise ship.

MARGARET BRENNAN: So for the Americans who are infected, what does that actually mean? What is the state of their health?

DR. FAUCI: Yeah, well, it varies. I mean, you could be infected and have minimal symptoms, but you still have the possibility of transmitting it to someone else. 

MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. 

DR. FAUCI: Or you could be infected and have some significant lung disease that would require hospitalization and perhaps even some serious intervention.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Now, Malaysian health authorities have also said there was an 83 year old American woman who had been on a different cruise ship which ended up docking in Cambodia. She landed in Malaysia and then tested positive. This kind of spread, does this indicate this is becoming a pandemic?

DR. FAUCI: Well, a pandemic is when you have multiple countries throughout the world that have what's called sustained transmission from person to person to person, multiple generations. Right now, there are 24 countries in which there were over five hundred cases. Several of them are starting to get to the second and third transmission. So technically speaking, the WHO wouldn't be calling this a global pandemic, but it certainly is on the verge of that happening reasonably soon unless containment is more successful than it is right now.

MARGARET BRENNAN: As Debora said, there are experts landing in China this week. 

DR. FAUCI: Right.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Americans will be among them. 

DR. FAUCI: Right. 

MARGARET BRENNAN: Is there anyone from your team and- and what is the difference--

DR. FAUCI: Yeah. 

MARGARET BRENNAN: --if, say, the CDC had been allowed in--

DR. FAUCI: Right. 

MARGARET BRENNAN: --versus the WHO?

DR. FAUCI: You know, MARGARET, to be honest with you, we really should not be talking about that because the sensitivity of coming out ahead of the Chinese of making any kind of announcement. But you're correct, there certainly-- 

MARGARET BRENNAN: But the Chinese ambassador was on this program last week and he indicated Americans were on that list. 

DR. FAUCI: Well, then if he says it, then they're on that list. Yes.

MARGARET BRENNAN: But- but what is the difference there? Why would it be more beneficial to have-- 

DR. FAUCI: Well, for two reasons--

MARGARET BRENNAN: --your agency be able to send people, have CDC officials there?

DR. FAUCI: Well, the reason is because first of all, this- our CDC are the best epidemiologists in the world. They can be helpful to the Chinese as well as get information firsthand, eyes, ears and boots on the ground. So it really is to be helpful as part of the WHO group.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Because the WHO has been criticized, perhaps being too careful around the Chinese government in their part of the U.N. agency. They receive international funding. China has tremendous power over them. Is that criticism fair?

DR. FAUCI: You know, I don't know if it's fair or not, but certainly it's been spoken about. I mean, clearly, the director of WHO, Dr. Tedros, is really an outstanding person. And under very difficult circumstances, I think he's doing a very good job.

MARGARET BRENNAN: The president has said at least twice so far that the virus could tick down in these warmer months ahead. He indicated--

DR. FAUCI: Right.

MARGARET BRENNAN: --President Xi told him that.

DR. FAUCI: Right.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Is that how the virus actually works?

DR. FAUCI: This virus, we don't know. But it is not unreasonable to say that influenza, for example, which peaks in the winter, you would certainly expect it by March, April and May to taper down, as well as typical common cold coronaviruses. That's not an unreasonable statement. However, we do not know what this particular virus is gonna do so. So we would think it would be a stretch to assume that it's going to disappear with the warm weather. We don't know that. It's completely unknown.

MARGARET BRENNAN: You said recently that you could have some kind of vaccine within a year or so. 

DR. FAUCI: Right, right.

MARGARET BRENNAN: How do you speed up that timeline and how do you fix the problem you said you have, which is finding a manufacturer?

DR. FAUCI: Right. Well, first of all, MARGARET, that one year timeline would be the world's indoor record of ever getting a vaccine out, at least to be able to early deploy. You can't do any better than that. If you go any faster, you'll be cutting dangerous corners.

MARGARET BRENNAN: And no manufacturer, yet?

DR. FAUCI: Oh yeah manufacturers. Once you get a vaccine that, you know works, the difficulty is having companies take that risk of hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars to scale up to make it available.

MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. So you're still looking for a partner on that?

DR. FAUCI: I think we're gonna get them--

MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. 

DR. FAUCI: --because I'm seeing interest on the part of pharmaceutical companies that we did not see with SARS and other outbreaks.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Dr. Fauci, thank you for this update. I appreciate it.

Cory Booker joins historically diverse field of candidates in 2020 race
evening-news
By Ed O'Keefe

February 1, 2019 / 6:36 PM EST / CBS News


Washington — New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker announced Friday he's running for president, making him the fifth Democrat to officially join the 2020 race. Three others have launched exploratory committees.

"I'm going to run a race about not who I'm against or what I'm against, but who I'm for and what I'm for," Booker said.

He said he was running for president to restore civic grace in America. The 49-year-old Rhodes Scholar and former mayor of Newark chose the first day of Black History Month to jump into the race.

His first moves, including interviews targeting Latinos and African Americans, are designed to win over those most loyal Democrats. For example, last year, 90 percent of black voters backed Democratic candidates for Congress. In 2016, they were a quarter of Democratic primary voters nationwide and more than six in 10 in the early primary state of South Carolina.

The 2020 contenders
Medicare for All emerges as first litmus test for 2020 Democratic contenders
Booker joins a historically diverse field that is speaking far more openly about race.

In an interview with "Face the Nation" moderator Margaret Brennan airing on Sunday, President Trump said he's unimpressed with Booker.

"He's got no chance," he said.

On Friday, a notable apology came from Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who is set to formally announce her candidacy next week. She reached out to leaders of the Cherokee Nation to apologize for taking and releasing a DNA test last fall showing she had a trace of Native American ancestry, something Mr. Trump has repeatedly mocked.

The tribe said they "are encouraged by this dialogue" and "hope that the slurs and mockery of tribal citizens and Indian history and heritage will now come to an end."

Like many events, proms and graduations across the U.S. have been canceled due to social distancing guidelines. High school seniors will miss out on the typical milestones many kids spend their teen years looking forward to. Actor John Krasinski said he couldn't stand the thought of so many kids missing prom — so he's going to throw them one.

Krasinski announced on social media he would hold a virtual prom on Friday night for all the kids in the class of 2020. "The Office" star has been posting daily episodes of his new digital show, "Some Good News," to spread joy during this dark time. He posted an invitation to his virtual prom on the show's Instagram page.

The location: YouTube Live. The dress code: Formal. Featuring: John Krasinski and friends. The livestream will begin at 8:00 p.m. ET, according to the invite. The star also shared a photo of himself at his own prom in 1997. "We know it's been hard for some of you to be missing prom, so we're bringing prom to YOU," he wrote in the caption.

A post shared by Some Good News (@somegoodnews) on Apr 16, 2020 at 2:15pm PDT

This is just one of the many things Krasinski has done to brighten people's lives during this unprecedented time. On each episode of "Some Good News," he shares stories of hope and inspiration. He has even invited some famous friends on the show, including Robert De Niro, who served as the show's weatherman, and his "The Office" cast mate Steve Carrel also joined. 

In another episode, Krasinski, who is from the Boston area, and Boston Red Sox legend David Ortiz surprised a group of hospital workers with Red Sox tickets for life. Krasinski invited nurses and respiratory therapists from Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston as guests via teleconference to thank them for their service during the coronavirus pandemic. Ortiz later appeared and expressed gratitude to them as well. 

In another "Some Good News" episode, the actor surprised a 9-year-old girl named Aubrey, whom he dubbed "heartbreak correspondent," with a "Hamilton" performance. Krasinski enlisted Lin-Manuel Miranda and other stars from the Broadway musical to join their video conference and start singing songs from the show for one very positive "zoom bombing" incident.



CBS Mornings
Deval Patrick on why he can "break through" crowded 2020 Democratic field
cbs-mornings
By Nicole Brown Chau

November 14, 2019 / 11:42 AM EST / CBS News


Deval Patrick, who announced Thursday that he is running for president, said on "CBS This Morning" he changed his mind about entering the 2020 race because he sees an opportunity "for big ideas." The former Massachusetts governor called the current field of Democrats "really talented," but questioned if they could "pull the nation together."

"We seem to be migrating to, on the one camp, sort of nostalgia — let's just get rid, if you will, of the incumbent president and we can go back to doing what we used to do," he said. "Or, you know, it's our way, our big idea, or no way. And neither of those, it seems to me, seizes the moment to pull the nation together."

Patrick, 63, said on "CBS This Morning" in June, that it would be hard to "break though" the field of Democrats "without being a celebrity or sensationalist." However, on Thursday, he said "you can't know if you can break through if you don't get out there and try." Making his announcement less than three months before the Iowa caucus, he said his life experiences help him relate to struggling Americans today.

"The anger and anxiety that I hear about and I read about and I see and I witness and listen to in all kind of corners of the country today is familiar to me for the same reasons, having grown up on the South Side of Chicago, the sense that the economy just kind of gets up and kicks you to the curb," he said.      

"I've been waiting for a moment like this my whole life," he said. "I don't mean a moment to run for president but a moment when the appetite for big ideas is big enough for the size of the challenges we face in America."     

When pressed about his stance on certain issues, Patrick said he doesn't support Medicare For All "in the terms we've been talking about," but supports a public health care option. He said he supports eliminating or vastly reducing student debt, and he thinks taxes should increase for "the most prosperous and the most fortunate" citizens.

"I think a wealth tax is — makes a lot of sense directionally. My idea would be a much, much simpler tax system for everyone where we eliminate all or most of the deductions and we smooth out and simplify the system we have," he said.

Patrick said he spoke with former President Barack Obama prior to his announcement and both agree that "we need to reach for the best of America."

"Not just the best of our party and not just the best of our supporters, but the best of America," Patrick said. "And that's going to come from a whole lot of people who have checked out and have felt, I think, rightly left out and left back. And what we want to do is bring them back in."

Patrick has been a CBS News political contributor since September, but in light of his decision, he will no longer serve in that role.

Patrick served as Massachusetts governor from 2007 to 2015 and was the U.S. assistant attorney general for the Civil Rights Division under former President Bill Clinton. He also has held corporate roles, including his most recent position as a managing director at Bain Capital, a private equity firm.

Dow closes below 20,000, wiping out nearly all the gains of Trump's presidency
moneywatch
By Aimee Picchi

Updated on: March 18, 2020 / 7:55 PM EDT / MoneyWatch


Stocks nosedived on Wednesday following the fourth trading halt in two weeks, with Wall Street spooked by the deepening economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic. President Donald Trump earlier in the day announced that U.S. and Canada will block "non-essential traffic" from traveling across the northern border to control the disease's spread.

The Dow fell 1,335, or 6.3%, to close at 19,903. Earlier in the day, stocks tumbled more than 10%, triggering the market's "circuit breaker" that halts trading for 15 minutes. Trading is stopped when stocks decline by 7%, 13% or 20% in a single session. The broad-based S&P 500 fell 5.2%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq slumped 4.7%.

"Markets were quick to give back Tuesday's gains, with equities returning to a sea of red," TD Securities analysts said.

Wednesday's slump wipes out roughly three years of stock market gains, with the Dow closing below 20,000 for the first time since 2017. On January 20, 2017, the day of President Donald Trump's inauguration, the index closed at 19,827. The S&P 500, which ended Thursday at 2,398, is just 227 points above its level when Mr. Trump formally took office.

The decline is noteworthy for its speed, with the losses mounting over the course of four weeks. The Dow had hit an all-time record on February 12, a little over a month ago, with the S&P and Nasdaq peaking a week later. 


The widening pandemic, which has led to at least 109 deaths in the U.S., is prompting cities and states across the U.S. to order residents to stay home and to shut restaurants and bars and other gathering places. Those measures are spiraling through the economy, leading to layoffs and sharp declines in revenue for many consumer-focused businesses. The U.S. is likely already in a recession, according to Oxford Economics. 

"We now see a severe global recession occurring in the first half of 2020," Deutsche Bank's economists wrote in a research note. "The quarterly declines in GDP growth we anticipate substantially exceed anything previously recorded going back to at least World War II."

The decline on Wednesday wipes out yesterday's market gains, which were fueled by President Donald Trump and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin announcement that the administration and Congress were working on a "big" and "bold" legislative package to address the coronavirus crisis. Mnuchin added that the administration is "looking at sending checks to Americans immediately." 

That bounce followed Monday's rout that marked Wall Street's worst day since the epic "Black Monday" crash in 1987. 

"The global pandemic of COVID-19 has sent world equity markets into bear market territory," said Burt White, chief investment officer for LPL Financial, in an email. "The result is a cumulative 30% drop in the S&P 500 Index in just under 30 days."


While it's unclear how long the coronavirus pandemic will last, President Trump earlier this week said it could go on through July or August. In the short-term, economists say the damage could be deep, leading to job losses, a spike in unemployment and a decline in GDP.

"Attention is understandably focused on limiting the damage from the short-term effects of the coronavirus outbreak," Oxford Economics said in a Wednesday note. "But it's likely that, once disruption and uncertainty fade, the rebound in global economic activity will be strong. It's important for firms to position themselves for such a recovery."

Wall Street firms are increasingly advising their clients to prepare for a "Blue Wave" of victories in next month's national election. Such an outcome would land Joe Biden in the White House and give Democrats a majority in both chambers of Congress.

In the past month, at least five of Wall Street's top strategists have sent reports to investors predicting a Democratic sweep. Goldman Sachs told clients in a research note earlier this week that the odds of Biden winning the presidency and Democrats gaining a majority in the Senate is roughly 65%. Analysts with the investment bank pointed out that stock prices have been rising since September, coinciding with political polls tilting increasingly toward Biden. 

Goldman also wrote that stocks and other investments that tend to rise when investors expect more inflation have lead the market higher since mid-September. This "reinflation trade," as it is called on Wall Street, is being fueled in part by expectations that a Blue Wave next month will increase the likelihood of lawmakers approving another major round of federal spending on unemployment benefits, cash payments for Americans and other stimulus measures. 

Jason Draho, a strategist at UBS, told clients last week that markets were starting to price in a "Blue Wave outcome." That consensus, which has hardened over the last month, is emerging despite a recognition on Wall Street that the political polls showing Biden well ahead of President Donald Trump could be misleading — just as the polls largely failed to predict Mr. Trump's victory four years ago. 

"The level of conviction that Hillary Clinton would win was high as well," Draho told CBS MoneyWatch. "But there is less confidence in the polls this time around, and I don't remember the possibility of a Blue Wave being part of the conversation in 2016."

Citigroup's top strategist, Tobias Levkovitz, also puts the odds of a Biden win at 65%. And earlier this week, Morgan Stanley's top U.S. stock strategist, Mike Wilson, said in a podcast published on the financial firm's website that investors now expect a "blue sweep." 

Prediction markets, where people wager on who'll prevail on Election Day, also foresee a win for Democrats. According to the Iowa Election Market, which is maintained by the University of Iowa, Biden has a 77% chance of winning. The likelihood that Democrats will gain control of both the House and Senate is 60%, according to the market.

Although stock market strategists are generally cautious in forecasting how a change in presidential administrations could affect financial markets, a number of Wall Street analysts have recently sought to reassure investors about the potential impact of a Biden win and a clean sweep for Democrats. 

"The consensus view is that a Democrat victory in November will be a negative for equities. However, we see this outcome as neutral to slightly positive," said Dubravko Lakos, a top strategist at JPMorgan Chase, in a recent report. 

Betting on more federal spending
The main reason investors appear sanguine: spending. Biden's economic blueprint would significantly boost government expenditures, which economists say is necessary to speed the country's recovery from the pandemic. Most market strategists also seem to think investors would welcome a larger stimulus package now even if that meant adding to the national debt, and possibly higher taxes in the future.

Last month, Moody's estimated that Biden's economic proposals could create 7.4 million more jobs over four years than under the economic agenda Mr. Trump has laid out. 

"The economic outlook is strongest under the scenario in which Biden and the Democrats sweep Congress and fully adopt their economic agenda," analysts with the credit rating agency wrote.

Last month was the hottest January on record, according to scientists

Last month was the warmest January in 141 years of climate record-keeping, according to a monthly assessment by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The January 2020 record beat the January 2016 record by 0.04 degrees Fahrenheit (0.02 of a degree Celsius).

The warmest year ever recorded is 2016, followed by 2019. Both, however, could be displaced if this year's first month marks a trend.

According to a statistical analysis by NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information scientists, 2020 is "very likely to rank among the five warmest years on record."


Global land and ocean surface temperatures in January 2020 were 2.05 degrees Fahrenheit (1.14 degrees Celsius) above the 20th-century average, according to NOAA. No land or ocean areas had record-cold January temperatures.

Notably, the record was "the highest monthly temperature departure without an El Niño present in the tropical Pacific Ocean." El Niño is a natural cycle of warming of the Central and sometimes Eastern Equatorial Pacific sea surface temperatures, occurring every few years on average.  

Temperatures have been ticking up in the 21st century. The 10 warmest Januaries have all occurred since 2002, with the four warmest all taking place in the last four years. 

The past 10 years marked the warmest decade on record, according to an annual global climate report released in January by NASA and NOAA. The past five years have been the warmest of the last 140 years.

"January 2020 marked the 44th consecutive January and the 421st consecutive month with temperatures, at least nominally, above the 20th-century average," according to NOAA.

While January 2020 was the warmest January so far overall, different parts of the globe saw differences in temperature rankings. The Northern Hemisphere had its warmest January on record, at 2.70 degrees F (1.50 degrees C) above average, but the Southern Hemisphere only had its second-warmest January on record, behind 2016.

According to NOAA, "the most notable warmer-than-average land temperatures" this January "were present across much of Russia and parts of Scandinavia and eastern Canada, where temperatures were 9.0°F (5.0°C) above average or higher." On the opposite end of the spectrum, "notable cool temperatures" were recorded in January across much of Alaska and parts of western Canada, with temperatures 7.2°F (4.0°C) below average or less.

While global temperatures increased in January, the weather in a particular region may not have correlated. This is because one month, or even one year, is not necessarily indicative of climate. 

"The difference between weather and climate is a measure of time," according to NASA. "When we talk about climate change, we talk about changes in long-term averages of daily weather."

Transcript: Scott Gottlieb discusses coronavirus on "Face the Nation," March 22, 2020
face-the-nation
March 22, 2020 / 11:42 AM EDT / CBS News

The following is a transcript of an interview of former FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb by CBS News' Margaret Brennan that aired Sunday, March 22, 2020, on "Face the Nation." 

MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. We turn now to former FDA commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb. He joins us from outside his home in Connecticut. Doctor, good to have you back with us. 

DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Thanks.

MARGARET BRENNAN: You've been talking to Congress. You talked to the administration. And you've been clear that you believe there was a failure to plan in January for March. And you're saying now, in March, we need to be looking ahead and planning for May. Exactly what is it that all of us need to be planning for?

DR. GOTTLIEB: Well, right now, we're engaging in broad based population based mitigation techniques, things like stay at home orders, closing schools. These are population level techniques to try to break off chains of transmission. That's the right thing to do in cities like San Francisco and New York, where we see hotspots, where we see epidemic spread. Unfortunately, we're not engaging in those tactics across the whole country. There should be some form of mitigation across the whole country because we're all at risk. But we need to start thinking about how we transition away from that. Come April, come May, when the epidemic curve starts coming down, we can't just take our foot off the brake immediately. We need to start it- start including and introducing what we call case based interventions, trying to do mass screening and identify people who either are infected or who've been in close contact with people who've been infected and go towards more of an individual person approach rather than a population level approach. That planning needs to be underway right now. We need to know how we're going to slowly transition into another paradigm. It's not a question of either or. It's a question of substituting in other techniques that are less intrusive to- for what we're doing now.

MARGARET BRENNAN: You heard Dr. Fauci say there's no doubt we're going to get hit. He mentioned New York. There are some projections from New York hospitals that a peak could hit within the next 20 days. What is it that Americans need to be prepared for?

DR. GOTTLIEB: Well, I think that the scenes out of New York are going to be shocking. I think that the hospitals in the next two weeks are going to be at the brink of being overwhelmed and we're going to start to see places like Javits Convention Center and other facilities used to start to house people. They're going to start getting thousands of admissions coming into that city. And this was infection that started two weeks ago. The time to hospitalization is nine to 12 days. I think there's other cities that are at extreme risk. New Orleans is at very high risk and they're not taking appropriate measures. This is a sticky virus. We're learning that much more of the transmission probably happens from touching contaminated surfaces. So any city that has a mass transit system is probably at risk and needs to be taking very aggressive steps. Cities like Chicago, San Francisco, New York, Boston. You've seen San Francisco implement tough measures.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.

DR. GOTTLIEB: Illinois recently implemented tough measures. We need to continue that right now.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Is there an existing antiviral drug that is effective and- in at least containing this or preventing someone from getting seriously ill?

DR. GOTTLIEB: No, there's drugs that look promising, there's drugs that are in- in proper trials. We really need to continue to conduct research to figure out what works. Right now, there is no drug that looks like it's proven so overwhelming in early stage clinical trials that we can say it's highly promising. There's drugs that suggest that they may have activity against this virus. But the other question is, when you introduce the drug, sometimes when you introduce an antiviral drug late in the course of the disease, after people are in the critical care unit and very sick, it may not provide a benefit. Sometimes you have to introduce an antiviral drug earlier. And that's how we treat the flu, for example, with drugs like Tamiflu. We introduced them earlier in the course of the illness and that's where they have the greatest benefit.

MARGARET BRENNAN: So you would agree with Dr. Fauci that there needs to be clinical trials of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, which the president said he thinks is already effective?

DR. GOTTLIEB: Absolutely, and that may not be the drug that ends up holding to his promise. The study that looked at that drug and showed activity was- was a study that involved about 20 patients and only six in the arm that showed the benefit. And the benefit that they showed was that they decrease the amount of virus in their- in their noses when you did nasal swabs in those patients. So it could very well be that the drug is reducing viral shedding, but having no impact on the clinical course of those patients. So the data on that is very preliminary. What we need to do is what we call a master protocol, where we basically test a lot of drugs at once. We randomize patients to different treatments so everyone gets a treatment if they need it and we figure out which is working the best. That's what we did with Ebola. We came up with some very--

MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.

DR. GOTTLIEB: --effective treatments against Ebola.

MARGARET BRENNAN: The Trump administration announced this past week that the first trial through NIH of a vaccine was started out in Seattle. Given the timeline for this, do resources need to be refocused from a vaccine into some of the treatments that- that you are talking about?

DR. GOTTLIEB: I think absolutely. We could have a drug, a potential prophylactic drug that could prevent people from getting an infection or even treating infection as early as this summer, especially when you look at some of the approaches where companies are developing antibodies that directly target the virus. I think this is highly promising. We need to be putting a lot of resources into that. Senator Daines introduced a provision in Capitol Hill that may be included in the final package and what it would do is it would basically scale up manufacturing right away for the promising treatments that make it into the government's sanction trials. So that if one ends up working, we're ready to distribute it on a mass scale. You have literally millions of doses available. Now, what's going to happen is a lot of those drugs won't work and we're going to end up throwing away the drug that we manufactured. But I think that's a small price to pay for the benefit of having drug available, if in fact one proves that it's working.

MARGARET BRENNAN: In other words, tax payers helping to subsidize some of this research immediately. When do you see us being able to plan about going back to normal life?

DR. GOTTLIEB: Well, I think it's going to be a slow transition. I think that the epidemic right now that's underway is probably going to peak sometime in April, probably late April and tail off into May and June and hopefully transmission will be broken off in July and August. We need to plan for what we're going to do in the fall to prevent another epidemic and outbreak. But life's never going to be perfectly normal till we get to a vaccine. We're always going to have to implement some measures, but they could be case based measures where we look at individuals and screened very aggressively for the virus and quarantine and isolate individual people rather than quarantining--

MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.  

DR. GOTTLIEB: --mass populations. That's what we need to get to. That's going to be a transition but we can get there. There is light at the end of this tunnel.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Dr. Gottlieb, thank you.

The Rolling Stones announce 2020 "No Filter" tour dates
By Sophie Lewis

February 6, 2020 / 1:44 PM EST / CBS News


The Rolling Stones are back — again. The iconic English rock band unveiled dates Thursday for their summer 2020 stadium tour. 

The band postponed its North American tour last May due to lead singer Mick Jagger's health, promising the shows in the U.S. and Canada would be rescheduled. The "No Filter" tour was slated to start April 20 in Miami before doctors told Jagger in late March he required treatment, reportedly for a heart valve issue.

"I'm so sorry to all our fans in America & Canada with tickets," Jagger tweeted at the time. "I really hate letting you down like this. I'm devastated for having to postpone the tour but I will be working very hard to be back on stage as soon as I can. Once again, huge apologies to everyone." 

In June, an energetic Jagger returned to the stage in Chicago to continue the tour. The 75-year-old showed no signs of ill health at the time, bringing his electric energy to every show with lead guitarist Keith Richards, 76, guitarist Ronnie Wood, 72, and drummer Charlie Watts, 78. 


The band will continue its "No Filter" tour, which began in 2017, with a 15-city run in May 2020, starting with San Diego and ending in Atlanta. 

"There's something about the rhythm of hitting the road. It gets in your blood," Jagger said in a promotional video for the upcoming tour. "Being on the road, you see a lot of the city. You meet a lot of people, you see old friends. It's magical." 

Tickets go on sale February 14, but pre-sale codes will be available earlier that week.

Decision to speed up 2020 census schedule not made by Census Bureau, internal watchdog finds
By Melissa Quinn

September 22, 2020 / 9:15 AM EDT / CBS News


Washington — The Department of Commerce's internal watchdog found that a recent decision to condense the 2020 census schedule was not made by officials within the bureau and warned the shortened schedule for the decennial population count increases the risks to obtaining a complete and accurate count.

According to the report from the department's inspector general, senior officials at the Census Bureau said they did not know who made the decision to speed up the schedule for the 2020 census. Some, however, "speculated the decision came from the department, while others thought the decision likely came from the White House." 

The coronavirus pandemic led the Census Bureau to temporarily suspend certain operations for the 2020 census in March, but in mid-April, the Commerce Department and the Census Bureau said they would be seeking approval from Congress to extend the window for field data collection and self-response to the end of October. If Congress provided the relief, it would allow an additional 120 calendar days for apportionment counts to be delivered to the president, extending the deadline from December 31 to April 30, 2021.

One senior official with the Census Bureau told the inspector general's office the agency "got feedback that both sides of both houses of [C]ongress were supportive" of the proposal, and the report said bureau officials believed "a statutory extension to the apportionment date would be forthcoming because there was no resistance to the extension."

But over the summer months, the Commerce Department's inspector general said the landscape changed, calling into question support for the extensions. The Census Bureau began fielding questions about accelerating field operations and movement in Congress to pass legislation extending the December 31 deadline stalled. The Office of Management and Budget also said it would be requesting additional money for the Census Bureau to "maintain timely delivery," and President Trump issued his memorandum excluding undocumented immigrants from the count used to apportion congressional seats.

Mr. Trump's order, however, is being challenged in federal courts.

In early August, after briefing Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross on options for meeting the initial apportionment deadline of December 31, the bureau announced it would be speeding up the schedule for the 2020 census.

In its review, the inspector general found that the shortened schedule "increases the risks to the accuracy of the 2020 Census," which determines how much communities receive in federal funding and the number of congressional seats each state receives. 

The Census Bureau sets a target to reach 99% of households, and a senior official with the bureau told the inspector general it "no longer [has] the runway" of time to correct errors through re-enumeration, which was needed in the 2000 and 2010 Censuses.

Top bureau officials also said they don't know what will happen if they don't hit the 99% target by September 30, which would allow for delivery of apportionment counts by year's end.

NFL Hall of Fame class of 2020 announced
By Jordan Freiman

February 1, 2020 / 7:30 PM EST / CBS News

The complete Pro Football Hall of Fame class of 2020 was unveiled on Saturday, one day before Super Bowl LIV. Troy Polamalu and Edgerrin James lead this year's class of five modern-day inductees along with Steve Atwater, Isaac Bruce and Steve Hutchinson. 

Polamalu spent his entire 12-season career as a safety for the Pittsburgh Steelers. The two-time Super Bowl champion was known as much for his ability on the field as he was for his long flowing mane of dark curly hair. Polamalu was also selected to eight Pro Bowls and was named NFL Defensive Player of the Year in 2010.

James is a former running back who spent 11 season with the Indianapolis Colts, Arizona Cardinals and Seattle Seahawks. James is a four-time Pro Bowler and holds the Colts franchise records for most career rushing yards, most career rushing touchdowns and most rushing yards in a single season. James led the league in rushing his 1990 rookie year and again the next season. He rushed for more than 1,000 yards in seven of his 11 seasons in the NFL.

Isaac Bruce was a wide receiver who spent 14 of his 16 seasons with the Los Angeles/St. Louis Rams. An integral part of the "Greatest Show on Turf," Bruce caught a 73-yard touchdown pass in Super Bowl XXXIV, which the Rams won 23-16 over the Tennessee Titans. Bruce made four Pro Bowls and led the league in receiving yards in 1996. Bruce finished his career with 1,024 receptions for 15,208 yards and 91 touchdowns.

Steve Hutchinson played guard for the Seattle Seahawks, Minnesota Vikings and Tennessee Titans. Hutchinson went to seven straight Pro Bowls from 2003-2009.

Atwater was a safety for the Denver Broncos from 1989-1998, and spent his final season in 1999 with the New York Jets. Atwater is a two-time Super Bowl winner with the Broncos and was a member of eight AFC Pro Bowl teams. 

To mark the 100th year of the NFL's existence, the 2020 centennial class is the largest class ever, featuring five modern-day inductees alongside two coaches, three contributors and 10 senior inductees to form a 20-person class.

Coaches Bill Cowher and Jimmy Johnson had already been announced as inductees during earlier NFL playoff games. Both men were surprised with the announcement live on-air while they were performing their normal duties as NFL analysts for CBS and Fox, respectively.

The senior inductees are: 

Harold Carmichael, receiver
Jim Covert, lineman 
Bobby Dillon, safety 
Cliff Harris, safety 
Winston Hill, lineman 
Alex Karras, defensive tackle 
Donnie Shell, safety 
Duke Slater, lineman 
Mac Speedie, defensive end
Ed Sprinkle, defensive linemen/linebacker        
The three contributors honored in 2020 are Steve Sabol, Paul Tagliabue and George Young. 

Sabol, along with his father Ed, is the co-founder of NFL Films. NFL Films highlights have become known for their excellent slow motion cinematography and iconic background music. Beginning in 1965, Philadelphia sports fixture John Facenda became the narrator of these highlight packages, earning him the nickname "The Voice of God" among NFL Fans.

Tagliabue was NFL commissioner from 1989-2006. During his tenure, the league introduced free agency and the expansion of the league from 28 to 32 teams. 

Young was the general manager of the New York Giants from 1979-1997. Prior to Young's arrival, the Giants spent much of the 1960s and all of the 1970s in a dismal state, failing to make the playoffs for 17 straight years. Young helped turn the franchise around, contributing to two Super Bowl wins during his tenure.

93,000 people died of drug overdoses in U.S. during pandemic in 2020: "A staggering loss of human life"
Updated on: July 14, 2021 / 7:01 PM EDT / AP


Overdose deaths soared to a record 93,000 last year in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, the U.S. government reported Wednesday.

That provisional estimate by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention far eclipses the high of about 72,000 drug overdose deaths reached the previous year and amounts to a 29% increase.

"This is a staggering loss of human life," said Brandon Marshall, a Brown University public health researcher who tracks overdose trends.

The nation was already struggling with its worst overdose epidemic but clearly "COVID has greatly exacerbated the crisis," he added.

Lockdowns and other pandemic restrictions isolated those with drug addictions and made treatment harder to get, experts said.

Jordan McGlashen died of a drug overdose in his Ypsilanti, Michigan, apartment last year. He was pronounced dead on May 6, the day before his 39th birthday.

"It was really difficult for me to think about the way in which Jordan died. He was alone, and suffering emotionally and felt like he had to use again," said his younger brother, Collin McGlashen, who wrote openly about his brother's addiction in an obituary.

Jordan McGlashen's death was attributed to heroin and fentanyl.

While prescription painkillers once drove the nation's overdose epidemic, they were supplanted first by heroin and then by fentanyl, a dangerously powerful opioid, in recent years. Fentanyl was developed to treat intense pain from ailments like cancer but has increasing been sold illicitly and mixed with other drugs.

"What's really driving the surge in overdoses is this increasingly poisoned drug supply," said Shannon Monnat, an associate professor of sociology at Syracuse University who researches geographic patterns in overdoses. "Nearly all of this increase is fentanyl contamination in some way. Heroin is contaminated. Cocaine is contaminated. Methamphetamine is contaminated."

There's no current evidence that more Americans started using drugs last year, Monnat said. Rather, the increased deaths most likely were people who had already been struggling with addiction. Some have told her research team that suspensions of evictions and extended unemployment benefits left them with more money than usual. And they said "when I have money, I stock up on my (drug) supply," she said.

Overdose deaths are just one facet of what was overall the deadliest year in U.S. history. With about 378,000 deaths attributed to COVID-19, the nation saw more than 3.3 million deaths.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reviewed death certificates to come up with the estimate for 2020 drug overdose deaths. The estimate of over 93,000 overdose deaths translates to an average of more than 250 deaths each day, or roughly 11 every hour.

The 21,000 increase is the biggest year-to-year jump since the count rose by 11,000 in 2016.

More historical context: According to the CDC, there were fewer than 7,200 total U.S. overdose deaths reported in 1970, when a heroin epidemic was raging in U.S. cities. There were about 9,000 in 1988, around the height of the crack epidemic.

The CDC reported that in 2020 drug overdoses increased in all but two states: New Hampshire and South Dakota.

Kentucky's overdose count rose 54% last year to more than 2,100, up from fewer than 1,400 the year before. There were also large increases in South Carolina, West Virginia and California. Vermont had the largest jump, of about 58%, but smaller numbers — 118 to 186.

The proliferation of fentanyl is one reason some experts do not expect any substantial decline in drug overdose deaths this year. Though national figures are not yet available, there is data emerging from some states that seems to support their pessimism. Rhode Island, for example, reported 34 overdose deaths in January and 37 in February - the most for those months in at least five years.

For Collin McGlashen, last year was "an incredibly dark time" that began in January with the cancer death of the family's beloved patriarch.

Their father's death sent his musician brother Jordan into a tailspin, McGlashen said.

"Someone can be doing really well for so long and then, in a flash, deteriorate," he said.

Then came the pandemic. Jordan lost his job. "It was kind of a final descent."

It was music's biggest night – but this year's Grammy Awards took on a mournful tone as stars and fans paid tribute to basketball legend Kobe Bryant. The show opened with tributes to Bryant from Lizzo and host Alicia Keys. The Los Angeles Lakers legend died in a helicopter crash earlier Sunday. The Grammys were held in the Staples Center, where the Lakers play their home games.

Lizzo garnered the most nominations this year, but Billie Eilish took home the coveted awards for record, song and album of the year, along with Best New Artist. Eilish was the youngest person ever nominated for all four awards at the same time. Lil Nas X was nominated six times and walked away with two wins.

The Recording Academy also honored slain rapper Nipsey Hussle, who posthumously won the Grammy for best rap performance. DJ Khaled, John Legend, Meek Mill and others paid tribute.

Last year, former first lady Michelle Obama was a surprise guest at the Grammys. This year, she won the award for best spoken word album for the audio version of her memoir, "Becoming."

Demi Lovato makes comeback with powerful performance
In her first major comeback since her 2018 overdose, Demi Lovato delivered an emotional performance of her song, "Anyone." Lovato was so overwhelmed, she had to restart the song shortly after she began, and a tear could be seen rolling down her cheek. 

In an interview with New Music Daily with Zane Lowe for Apple Beats 1, Demi Lovato revealed the song was written just days before her near-fatal overdose, and saw the song as a "cry for help." Demi Lovato is now clean and sober and is gearing up to perform the national anthem at this year's Super Bowl. 

Lovato released the track shortly after the performance.

"Tonight is for Kobe": Lizzo kicks off 62nd Annual Grammy Awards
Lizzo, who has the most nominations of any artist this year, kicked off the 62nd Annual Grammy Awards by saying "Tonight is for Kobe."

Legendary Los Angeles Laker Kobe Bryant, along with his daughter, Gianna, died in a helicopter crash earlier on Sunday. The Lakers play their home games at the Staples Center, where the Grammys are being held. A large crowd of Lakers fans came to mourn the late NBA star.

The eight-time nominee then launched into a performance of  "Cuz I love you" before switching into an energetic rendition of her 2017 hit "Truth Hurts". Earlier in the night it was announced Lizzo won Best Contemporary Album for "Cuz I Love You", and Best Traditional Performance for her song "Jerome."  — Jordan Freiman, Amalia Nunez

Women's marches kick off across the country

Thousands of people gathered in cities across the country for the 2020 Women's March. The fourth iteration of the march was expected to have the lowest turnout since its inception in 2017.

The first Women's March took place the day after President Trump was sworn into office on January 21, 2017. The march attracted 1 million protesters in Washington D.C. alone. Similar demonstrations were held in cities around the world, from New York, Philadelphia, Chicago and Los Angeles to Paris, Berlin, London, Prague, Sydney and beyond.

Protesters in the 2017 marches held signs with messages such as "Women won't back down," and decried Mr. Trump's stance on such issues as abortion, health care, diversity and climate change. Some protesters wore pink, pointy-eared "pussyhats," while others chanted: "Welcome to your first day, we will never go away."

In the year's since the first record-breaking protest, the Women's March organization has faced controversy and internal turmoil that have turned some away from their demonstrations.

Ahead of the 2019 march, Teresa Shook, one of the Women's March founders, accused some of the group's leaders of anti-Semitism. The accusation was leveled at two primary leaders: Linda Sarsour, who has criticized Israeli policy, and Tamika Mallory, who has maintained an association with Louis Farrakhan, leader of Nation of Islam, which the Southern Poverty Law Center considers a hate group.

The group at first refused to remove the controversial members from their board. But months later, it was announced that three of the leaders — including Sarsour and Mallory — would step down from the board to work on "other projects focused on advocacy within their respective organizations," reads the organization's press release.

Despite rain and sleet, crowds arrived Saturday morning in the U.S. capital to march.

The march is being led by the Chilean protest group, Las Tesis, according to the Women's March website. When the march reaches the front of the White House, the group perform the protest anthem, Un Violador en tu Camino (A Rapist in Your Path). Blindfolded performers chant the song, with the chorus: "And it's not my fault, not where I was, not how I dressed."

After the anthem is done, the thousands of "women, femmes, and allies"  will head back to Freedom Plaza.

Burning Man 2020 Goes All-In On Virtual Reality With 'Multiverse'
sanfrancisco
August 30, 2020 / 4:30 PM PDT / CBS San Francisco

SAN FRANCISCO (CBS SF) -- This same time last year, tens of thousands of Americans were determining what they wanted to bring to an unforgiving desert and set on fire. It could have been a piece of paper, a memento, a sculpture, a wooden humanoid.

For a week or so at the end of summer, thousands would pack into their vans, campers and art cars to spend some of the hottest days of the year in the Nevada desert dancing, doing yoga, mingling, making art and, of course, burning the Man. This year, the community is taking to the virtual world -- or rather, eight of them.

Burning Man is another pillar of the artistic community in the Bay Area and beyond compromised by the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. It began on Baker Beach in San Francisco on the night of the summer solstice in 1986. The first "Man" burned was only 8 feet tall and, according to Burning Man pioneers Larry Harvey and Jerry James, the first crowd totaled 35 people.

After growing interference from San Francisco law enforcement, the first Burn in the Black Rock Desert took place in 1990, where it continued until this year. The organization's website offers a comprehensive timeline of the gathering's origins from a spontaneous meetup at the beach to a "city" the physical size of San Francisco with its own airport and hospital and dozens upon dozens of eccentric art communities and camps.

Burning Man 2020: Multiverse

In 2019, nearly 80,000 people from more than 25 countries congregated in the midst of over 400 art installations and the pyrotechnic Man standing 61 feet tall. None of that can happen this year but there will still be plenty to see and plenty of ways to safely participate in emotional immolation in Burning Man Multiverse: A global quantum kaleidoscope of possibility.

Burning Man's creative initiatives director Kim Cook has a hard time describing Burning Man. She's not really a Burner, in fact her first experience there was her job interview on the Playa five years ago. But she'd known about it back in the '90s when she was running a theater company in San Francisco; she let local Burners work on their art pieces in the company warehouse when it got too hot outside in the summer.

"People encouraged me to come; a lot of people I knew were going and coming back and raving about it," Cook said. "One of the things people often say is, Burning Man is so personal: every experience will be unique to that individual. It's really best to describe it to the personal and the particular and not the general."

Although, there are some universals: artistic innovation, crazy outfits, camping blunders, "mutant vehicles," yoga, alkaline dust everywhere, and camps purporting themes like pizza, choir, BDSM, and even a "Kidsville."

Cook says that the Burning Man board started mobilizing for a virtual launch back in early April, mere weeks after quarantine measures were put in place. Fourteen thousand Burners responded to a survey supporting a virtual Burn and, so, the Multiverse was born.

There's something for everyone, and all levels of access to technology. One world, SparkleVerse, despite broadcasting from the United Kingdom, just requires a computer and internet connection. These interactive parties began in early quarantine and use a mix of Zoom rooms and animation to host DJ parties, "erotic experiences" and opportunities to meet fellow Burners. Another, The Infinite Playa, hosts a hyper-realistic Black Rock Desert you can view on your phone, down to the cracks in the earth beneath your avatar's feet.

Athena Demos is one of the minds facilitating BRCvr -- Black Rock City virtual reality. The concept is actually not new. She and her collaborators Doug Jacobson and Greg Edwards came up with a virtual landscape to archive the art and experiences of years past back in 2014. When they brought the idea to the higher-ups, Demos says that "they didn't really get it" because, at the time, it was primarily an archive. Enter the coronavirus.

A week before they announced a virtual burn for 2020, BRCvr was uploaded onto the AltspaceVR platform.

"I call it Nostalgia Burn," Demos says over Zoom from Mexico, where she is currently helping coordinate the launch, set for Aug. 30. Every day, there are more pixels to render and more avatars to accommodate and more art to fit into the virtual desert; it changes daily, and unlike the physical manifestations, this Black Rock City can curate decades worth of art and layer people's experiences. Avatars can move between camps and art installations through designated portals, and guests are organized into 50-odd member groups to socialize. Apparently, you can even fly.

"Right now it looks like Burning Man 2014, based on that experience. It incorporates art from all the years, all the way from 2002. It feels like I'm home," she says, smiling.

Demos would know. She's been a Burner since 1999 and she calls herself a "99er." She's been a recognized regional contact for Burners in Los Angeles for over a decade, coordinating artists, orienting newcomers, leading Burners Without Borders initiatives and more. She is in the midst of slowly stepping down from her role; she says she has 14 replacements lined up to share her workload.

You don't necessarily need a VR headset to experience BRCvr, but it does help. Guests create avatars to represent them in dust-free, virtual space. Avatars "arrive" at the gate and have free rein from there, to explore, congregate or just wander. The group has talked about hosting virtual tours for first-timers but no decisions on that yet. The universe's press release states it "magically embraces the spirit, culture, and principles of the real-world event in an interactive VR-first expression that cultivates conversation, connection, and community."

The other five universes are: Multiverse, a virtual-reality experience with a photorealistic Black Rock City filled with 2020 Honoraria art installments, sound stages and hundreds of theme camps; the Bridge Experience, an XR universe that brings together three worlds - a water world, a green world, and a desert world; BURN2, a community built on the "Second Life" computer game; Build-A-Burn, an interactive online art project that only requires a web browser and a webcam; and MysticVerse, a virtual building experience from Cyberius Rex and Simeone Scaramozzino of Camp Mystic.

Amid a worsening pandemic, Demos believes we need connection and catharsis more than ever.

"The need to burn is very high this year," she says. "It feels like this is the rapture. This burn allows us to remember and reflect." The universe also offers tool kits for users to build their own worlds and even their own Man to burn at home, safely.

The BRCvr is a free experience and Cook has said that Burning Man has refunded $20 million in ticket sales that they could not provide the typical experience for.

"This has been a labor of love. We all have expenses. Please go to our website and contribute what you can. We also have a donate button for the organization, 100 percent goes to Burning Man," says Demos and the promise of a Burning Man 2021.

Cook is confident about the impending virtual odyssey, despite financial uncertainty.

"Whether or not people have a desert experience, I think it's possible to have an experience of generosity and surprise and delight, so the spirit of Burning Man I hope will convey itself through this extravaganza," she says.

What were the most popular Twitter trends this year?
By Chevaz Clarke

December 7, 2020 / 7:09 PM EST / CBS News

This past year has been a rollercoaster of a ride — from the coronavirus pandemic and social justice movements to an economic downturn and the election — 2020 has provided an endless array of topics for people to talk about online. Twitter has just released a roundup of how people kept themselves entertained and engaged with one another on the platform in 2020.

As most of us remained indoors during the pandemic, it won't come as a surprise that "quarantine" was mentioned 1.6 million times. And in a year where "going out" has become a euphemism for taking a brief walk, tweets featuring the word "home" were up 143% from 2019. While the coronavirus has dominated 2020, social justice movements have played a big part in shaping the country this year. 

Across the world, people used Twitter to advocate for what they believe in and the platform's year-end trends indicate just that. Usage of the hashtag #transrightsarehumanrights increased by 557% and the hashtag #Blacklivesmatter was the third most used in 2020.

In August, the nation came together to honor the tragic passing of Marvel's "Black Panther" star Chadwick Boseman, who died at age 43 after a four-year battle with cancer. The tweet announcing his passing was the most liked, retweeted and quote tweeted in the U.S. in 2020.


For the fourth year in a row, Korean pop sensation BTS was the most tweeted-about musicians in the U.S. The seven-member boy band, who have over 31 million followers on Twitter, are continuing to build their roster of diehard fans who call themselves the A.R.M.Y., an acronym for Adorable Representative M.C. for Youth. Kanye West, who made an unsuccessful bid for the White House this year, came second in Twitter's music roundup, followed by superstar Beyoncé.

BTS also snagged the title for the most tweeted-about celebrities. The late Kobe Bryant, who was killed alongside eight others in a helicopter crash at the beginning of the year, was the second most mentioned star. Lakers star LeBron James follows, with music moguls Kanye West and Beyoncé wrapping up the top five.

This year, Twitter also compiled a list of celebrities with the most follower growth. Popstar Ariana Grande, rapper Lil Baby and NBA icon LeBron James rounded out the top three.

With many movie theaters closed across the country, people turned to streaming services and TV shows to fill that void of entertainment. Michael Jordan's "The Last Dance," which chronicled the lead-up to the NBA legend's final championship run with the Chicago Bulls in the 1990s, was the most tweeted-about TV show. Also capturing people's attention was "Tiger King" and "The Bachelor," which took second and third place, respectively.

Takeaways from the Republican National Convention
By Melissa Quinn, Caroline Linton

August 28, 2020 / 7:06 AM EDT / CBS News


The Republican National Convention concluded Thursday night with a packed crowd at the White House and fireworks set against the Washington Monument, closing out a week marked by dire warnings about the future of the country if Joe Biden is elected in November and promises for what a second term with President Trump would hold.

The four-day event, which kicked off Monday, culminated with Mr. Trump's address accepting the GOP presidential nomination, an event that brought more than 1,500 of his supporters, former White House officials and Republican lawmakers to the South Lawn of the White House.

The convention underwent several changes as the coronavirus pandemic roiled the 2020 election, beginning with plans for a large-scale event in Charlotte, North Carolina, then an expansion to include Jacksonville, Florida, followed by a cancellation of major events in both cities as COVID cases spiked. In the end, official party business was carried out in Charlotte, where Mr. Trump and Vice President Mike Pence were formally nominated Monday.

Speeches throughout the week, many of which were pre-recorded, sought to paint a dark picture of America's future should Biden defeat Mr. Trump in November, while casting the president as vital to protecting the principles the country was founded upon and the "American way of life."

Here are the biggest takeaways from the Republican National Convention.

Coronavirus in the rearview
The coronavirus pandemic that has crippled the U.S. economy and claimed the lives of more than 180,000 people in the U.S. was seldom mentioned across the convention's four nights of speeches, and was characterized in some instances as a challenge the nation has already been surmounted.

In remarks delivered Tuesday, Larry Kudlow, Mr. Trump's chief economic adviser, suggested the coronavirus has been defeated.

"It was awful," Kudlow said in remarks. "Health and economic impacts were tragic. Hardship and heartbreak were everywhere. But presidential leadership came swiftly and effectively with an extraordinary rescue for health and safety to successfully fight the COVID virus."

Republicans also sought to recast the president's handling of the coronavirus as a success, while Trump himself extolled his administration's response to the coronavirus pandemic, calling it the "largest national mobilization since World War II."

The Republican National Convention went through several iterations due to health concerns attributed to the pandemic and ultimately was scaled down. Most speeches were pre-recorded and delivered from the Mellon Auditorium in Washington, D.C., but Mr. Trump's address garnered the attendance of more than 1,500, who took seats close to one another on the South Lawn.

Not all attendees wore masks and not all were tested for the coronavirus, though the Trump campaign said it was complying with federal and local guidelines.

Convention events set against the backdrop of the White House
Sprinkled throughout the four-day convention were events during which Mr. Trump used the office of the presidency and the backdrop of the White House to further his political endeavors.

On Tuesday, the second night of the convention, the president hosted a naturalization ceremony at the White House, with acting Secretary of Homeland Security Chad Wolf administering the oath of allegiance to five new citizens.

That same night, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo delivered remarks in a pre-recorded address from Jerusalem, during which he praised Mr. Trump' foreign policy record. Pompeo is on a multi-day swing through the Middle East.

Both events raised questions of possible violations of the Hatch Act, which governs the political activity of executive branch employees.

Capping off the convention, Mr. Trump delivered his speech accepting the GOP presidential nomination. At the conclusion of his remarks, which stretched over an hour, a fireworks display that formed "Trump" and "2020" was launched around the Washington Monument, and an opera singer serenaded attendees from the White House balcony.

Trump family members prominently featured
Members of Mr. Trump's family addressed voters on each of the convention's four nights.

On Monday, Donald Trump Jr., Mr. Trump's oldest son, kicked off remarks for the Trump family and was joined on the schedule of speakers by his girlfriend, former Fox News host Kimberly Guilfoyle.

On Tuesday, Tiffany Trump, the president's youngest daughter, and Eric Trump, his son, made their pitch to voters for why their father should be elected to a second term. First lady Melania Trump closed out the second night of the convention with a speech from the Rose Garden.

On Wednesday, Lara Trump, Eric Trump's wife and the president's daughter-in-law, made her case to Americans for Mr. Trump's reelection.

On Thursday, Ivanka Trump, the older of the president's children and a senior adviser at the White House, introduced Mr. Trump before he delivered his speech accepting the GOP nomination. All of the president's children, including his youngest son, Barron, joined Mr. Trump and first lady Melania Trump on stage at the end of his address.

Casting a vote for Joe Biden as a vote for "the Squad" and Nancy Pelosi
A favorite line throughout the convention was the characterization of Biden as a "Trojan horse" for the progressive wing of the Democratic party. 

In his acceptance speech Thursday, the president called his Democratic rival a "Trojan horse for socialism."

"He takes his marching orders from liberal hypocrites who drive their cities into the ground while fleeing far from the scene of the wreckage," Mr. Trump said of Biden.

On Wednesday, Pence, too, called Biden "nothing more than a Trojan horse for the radical left."

Congressman Matt Gaetz laid the groundwork for the attack on the former vice president during his remarks on the first night of the convention and said casting a vote for Biden would effectively be handing power to Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a Democrat from New York. Former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley echoed the line.

"Last time, Joe's boss was Obama," Haley said. "This time, it would be Pelosi, Sanders, and the Squad. Their vision for America is socialism. And we know that socialism has failed everywhere."

Passing references to protests in Kenosha, Wisconsin
Casting a shadow over the convention was the nightly protests that have taken place in Kenosha in response to the shooting of Jacob Blake, a 29-year-old Black man, by police.

Pence and Mr. Trump each referenced the Wisconsin city by name, but not in marking the shooting. Instead, they cited Kenosha as an example of the dangers of the Biden presidency, warning that looting, arson and violence would be rampant if he is elected.

"What we can never have in America and must never allow is mob rule," Mr. Trump said Thursday. "In the strongest possible terms, the Republican Party condemns the rioting, looting, arson and violence we have seen in Democrat-run cities like Kenosha, Minneapolis, Portland, Chicago and New York."

Only Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson mentioned Blake by name.

"Before I begin, I'd like to say that our hearts go out to the Blake family and the other families, who've been impacted by the tragic events in Kenosha," he said. "As Jacob's mother has urged the country, 'Let's use our hearts, our love, and our intelligence to work together, to show the rest of the world how humans are supposed to treat each other. America is great when we behave greatly.'"

Republicans push message of law and order
Against the backdrop of the ongoing unrest in Kenosha, Republicans tried to cast Mr. Trump as the only choice to avoid lawlessness. Hours before the third night of the convention started on Wednesday, Mr. Trump tweeted that he wanted to send in the National Guard to Kenosha. The Department of Justice confirmed federal agents would be sent in to quell protests. 

There were some speakers who emerged from the protests in St. Louis: Mark and Patricia McCloskey, the couple captured in a viral photograph pointing guns at Black Lives Matter protesters, and Ann Dorn, whose husband was killed outside a pawn shop on June 2 during a violent night in the city. The McCloskeys and Dorn praised Mr. Trump for his reaction to the protests. 

On Wednesday night, Pence said four more years of the Trump administration would bring "law and order on the streets of America for every American of every race and creed and color."

Ahead of Mr. Trump's speech on Thursday, New York's police union president Pat Lynch accused Democratic politicians of having "surrendered our streets and institutions." Citing the spate of recent crime in New York City, former Mayor Rudy Giuliani warned "don't let Democrats do to America what they have done to New York." 

Mr. Trump stressed that the GOP "in the strongest possible terms" condemns the looting, arson and violence that has occurred in Wisconsin and elsewhere, and issued a forceful denunciation of the violence in major U.S. cities, including Portland, where he deployed federal law enforcement this summer, Chicago and New York. 


"As long as I am president, I will defend the absolute right of every American citizen to live in security, dignity and peace," he said.

Mr. Trump attempted to portray a grim landscape of the country if Biden wins in November, claiming that if he loses reelection and Democrats win control of both chambers of Congress, "they will apply their disastrous policies to every city, town and suburb in America."

Dallas Wings, WNBA To Play Shortened 2020 Season In Florida During Coronavirus Pandemic
texas
June 15, 2020 / 2:56 PM CDT / CBS Texas


NEW YORK (CBSDFW.COM) – The Dallas Wings will be hitting the court soon, but not at their home in Arlington.

The WNBA announced plans Monday to to play a shortened 2020 season in Florida starting in July.

The league is finalizing a partnership that would make IMG Academy in Bradenton, Florida, the Official Home of the 2020 WNBA season highlighted by a competitive schedule of 22 regular-season games followed by a traditional playoff format.

Usually there are 34 games in a regular season.

IMG Academy will be the home for each of the league's 12 teams and serve as a single site for training camp, games and housing.

"We are finalizing a season start plan to build on the tremendous momentum generated in the league during the offseason and have used the guiding principles of health and safety of players and essential staff to establish necessary and extensive protocols," said WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert. "We will continue to consult with medical experts and public health officials as well as players, team owners and other stakeholders as we move forward with our execution plan. And, despite the disruption caused by the global pandemic to our 2020 season, the WNBA and its Board of Governors believe strongly in supporting and valuing the elite women athletes who play in the WNBA and therefore, players will receive their full pay and benefits during the 2020 season."

"As home to some of the world's leading athletes, coaches and performance experts, IMG Academy is thrilled to partner with the top basketball players in the world and the entire WNBA family," said Tim Pernetti, Executive Vice President, IMG Events & Media. "We are truly looking forward to becoming the Official Home of the 2020 WNBA Season and working closely with the league in providing our best-in-class training and competition environment."

The WNBA said it will build also on "its commitment to social justice and will support players in launching a bold social justice platform as a call to action to drive impactful, measurable and meaningful change."

The WNBA 2020 season will include a devoted platform led by the players that will aim to support and strengthen both the league and teams' reach and impact on social justice matters. As recently announced, this began with the WNBA making donations from sales of its "Bigger Than Ball" women's empowerment merchandise to the Equal Justice Initiative.

"The WNBA opposes racism in all its forms, and George Floyd and Breonna Taylor are the latest names in a list of countless others who have been subject to police brutality that stems from the systemic oppression of Black Lives in America, and it is our collective responsibility to use our platforms to enact change," said Engelbert.

A Look Back At The Unprecedented 2020 Hurricane Season
miami
May 30, 2021 / 11:36 AM EDT / CBS Miami


MIAMI (CBSMiami) -- The 2020 hurricane season earned the title of the most active year for hurricanes on record.

The forecast called for an extremely active hurricane season which began with the first named storm before the official start of the season. By the middle of the season, it looked like those forecasts would be correct and by the end, it turned out to be one for the record books.

For the second time in history the standard 21 storm names would not be enough, and for the first time in history we had thirty named storms finishing the season with Category 5 Hurricane Iota.

Storm tracks covered most of the Atlantic, and the Caribbean, with a large number of storms making landfall along the Gulf Coast.

The first major hurricane of the season was Laura which became a Category 3 storm on August 26. It would continue to strengthen before making landfall along the Louisiana Coast on August 27. It was one of eight named storms to impact the Gulf Coast from Tropical Storm Beta causing flooding in Texas to the Florida Panhandle where Hurricane Sally caused this damage around Pensacola.

Hurricane Delta, although not as strong, made landfall in nearly the same location as Laura delaying the recovery or even reversing it. Blowing out makeshift windows and plywood put in place after Laura.

This was not the only location that had to deal with multiple storms this season. In Nicaragua, major Hurricane Eta made landfall on November 3. It caused catastrophic damage and flooding there and in Honduras. It was less than 2 weeks later that Hurricane Iota made landfall just 15 miles south of where Eta did. Iota was a category 5 storm just off the coast with wind speeds of 160 mph but, like Eta, was a Category 4 storm at landfall. Catastrophic flooding pushed inland with the storm spreading from Nicaragua into Guatemala.

One of the few places relatively spared from this record hurricane season was South Florida.

Isaias was the closest hurricane staying just off the coast. Laura, however, was one storm we watched closely. Conditions were favorable to bring Laura, a strengthening tropical storm near Puerto Rico, towards South Florida before it redeveloped to the south of the island. The storm then continued to jog even farther south which meant a big change for our forecast. There was land disruption with Hispaniola and eventually Cuba which weakened Laura as it tracked over 100 miles to our south. If the storm had stayed with the northern track, it could have resulted in a significant hurricane for South Florida.

It wasn't until Early November that the 2020 hurricane season would bring the biggest impacts to South Florida. After curving back over the Caribbean, Eta crossed over Cuba and then turned northwest making landfall in the Middle Keys on Sunday Night November 8. Even though it was a Tropical Storm most of South Florida woke up to widespread flooding Monday morning. Areas in Broward County received over a foot of rain leading to flooding for days.

Of the 30 named storms for the record-breaking season, it was one tropical storm that had the biggest impacts here in South Florida.

Elizabeth Warren could face crowded Democratic field in 2020 race
evening-news
By Ed O'Keefe

December 31, 2018 / 6:33 PM EST / CBS News


Elizabeth Warren chose the final day of 2018 to announce her interest in running for president in 2020. She's among the first to enter what's expected to be a crowded race.

A new exploratory committee allows her to start raising money, hire staff and travel to early primary states. It also makes her the first U.S. senator and first woman to take official steps toward a 2020 campaign that could eventually include nearly two dozen contenders. At least seven other senators, current and former mayors, governors, cabinet secretaries and former vice president Joe Biden are considering bids.

The 69-year-old just won her second Senate term in November. She represents Massachusetts, but was born and raised in Oklahoma. Warren taught at law schools in New Jersey, Texas and Pennsylvania before ending up at Harvard University.

With a background in bankruptcy and commercial law, she pushed for the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in response to the 2008 economic collapse. In the Senate, she's been a fierce critic of top corporate executives.

In September, Warren revealed a DNA test had found she has Native American ancestors. But the Cherokee Nation tribe denounced her move as "inappropriate and wrong." On Monday, she defended her decision.

"I have put it all out there," she said.

Warren took the test partly in response to attacks by President Trump, who often mocks her.

With 673 days to go until Election Day, other contenders are spending the final hours of 2018 talking it over with their families and interviewing potential staffers. More announcements are expected shortly after the new year.

"The film's true power is elemental, rooted in weather conditions that all but erase the distinction between land and sky, and in the inky darkness of a tunnel traversed by one haggard, trudging figure whose weary body intermittently blocks a sliver of light barely visible at its far end," describes AV Club reviewer Mike D'Angelo about the Icelandic drama.

U.S. reported more COVID-19 cases in November than most countries had all year
By Jason Silverstein

November 30, 2020 / 3:26 PM EST / CBS News


The United States reported more than 4 million coronavirus cases in November, which is higher than the total number of cases seen all year by any country in the world except India and Brazil. Public health experts are warning that the U.S. will keep seeing record-breaking numbers in the final month of 2020.

Since the pandemic began, the U.S. has seen more than 13.3 million confirmed cases and over 267,000 deaths, by far the highest numbers in the world, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. The U.S. accounts for nearly 20% of the global death toll.

India has recorded 9.4 million cases and Brazil has 6.3 million, according to Johns Hopkins data. Other nations with the highest case counts — including Russia, France, Spain and the United Kingdom — have between 1.6 million and 2.3 million. There have been a total of 62.8 million confirmed cases and 1.4 million deaths worldwide. 

The U.S. in November set several grim new records in the pandemic. It surpassed 100,000 daily cases for the first time on November 4, and then more than 200,000 daily cases for the first time on November 28. The nation also passed 90,000 coronavirus hospitalizations for the first time. Hospitals in many communities are at or near capacity and have raised alarms about being overwhelmed as demand continues to grow.

November 24 was the deadliest day of the pandemic since May, with more than 2,100 coronavirus deaths nationwide. About half of the 50 states reported their highest daily toll for the virus, as many states reintroduced restrictions or added new ones to try to contain the spread. 

The month also brought encouraging news about vaccines, with three candidates reported to be more than 90% effective, and the first U.S. vaccinations expected to begin in December once the FDA grants emergency authorization. Health care workers would be among the first to get vaccinated. 

Moncef Slaoui, leader of the U.S. government's Operation Warp Speed vaccine effort, said there could be enough doses for 25 to 30 million Americans a month in 2021.


But the U.S. is poised to see even worse days in the pandemic before a vaccine is widely available. The CDC said the U.S. death toll could hit 321,000 by the middle of December.

Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's leading infectious disease expert, warned that more spikes will come after millions of people traveled for Thanksgiving — something public health officials advised Americans to avoid.

"We may see a surge upon a surge," Fauci told ABC News' "This Week" on Sunday. "We don't want to frighten people, but that's just the reality."

Stacey Abrams says 2020 presidential bid is "definitely on the table"
By Peter Martinez, Stefan Becket

March 11, 2019 / 6:46 PM EDT / CBS News


Stacey Abrams, the Democratic candidate who narrowly lost her race for Georgia governor in 2018, said she isn't ruling out a run for president in 2020.

Speaking at the South by Southwest (SXSW) festival Monday, Abrams said she had previously considered 2028 to be the earliest she would run for president, but later tweeted she's now considering a 2020 run.

"[Twenty] years ago, I never thought I'd be ready to run for POTUS before 2028," she wrote. "But life comes at you fast ... Now 2020 is definitely on the table."

In #LeadFromTheOutside, I explore how to be intentional about plans, but flexible enough to adapt. 20 years ago, I never thought I’d be ready to run for POTUS before 2028. But life comes at you fast - as I shared in Q&A w @Yamiche at @sxsw. Now 2020 is definitely on the table...

— Stacey Abrams (@staceyabrams) March 11, 2019
Her former campaign manager Lauren Groh-Wargo also tweeted Abrams' comment about not running before 2028 was a reference to a "years-old spreadsheet" Abrams uses to keep track of her career goals. 

"She is taking a look at all options on the table in 2020 and beyond," Groh-Wargo wrote.

A rising star in Democratic politics, Abrams has been courted by Democratic activists to run for Senate or make another bid for governor since being narrowly defeated by Republican Brian Kemp in the November midterm elections. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer recently told The Associated Press he was encouraging her to challenge Georgia's incumbent senator in 2020.

"There's no one who knows how to fight for voting rights better than Stacey Abrams," Schumer said. "If she got to the Senate, she'd have a huge platform to do it, not just in Georgia, but nationally." 

If she chose to run, she would be joining the most diverse field of Democratic presidential hopefuls in history. She would be the third African-American candidate, joining Sens. Kamala Harris and Cory Booker. She would also be the fifth woman to jump in the race: Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard and Harris have all thrown their hats in the ring. 

Abrams was tapped to deliver the Democratic rebuttal to President Trump's State of the Union address in February, using the national spotlight to highlight her working-class roots and commitment to protecting voting rights.

Transcript: Gary Cohn on "Face the Nation," January 19, 2020

January 19, 2020 / 7:47 AM EST / CBS News


The following is a transcript of an interview with Gary Cohn, the former director of the National Economic Council, that aired Sunday, January 19, 2020, on "Face the Nation."

FACE THE NATION MODERATOR MARGARET BRENNAN: We're back with Gary Cohn. He is the former director of the National Economic Council under President Trump. He's back in the private sector these days. Thank you for being here.

FORMER NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL DIRECTOR GARY COHN: Thank you for having me.

MARGARET BRENNAN: So the economy is going to be front and center in this election. Many economists say we're overdue for a recession. Do you think we're on the brink of one?

COHN: Margaret, first of all, it's great to be here. I know a lot of people have been talking about a recession. I do not see a recession on the horizon here. The U.S. economy is strong and continues to be very strong. The U.S. consumer is very strong. If you look at what's happened in the last couple of years with tax reform, we have put more disposable income in the hands of the U.S. consumer, and the U.S. consumer is out spending it.

MARGARET BRENNAN: So then why is the president and his-- the man currently in the job you once held, Larry Kudlow, continuing to criticize the Fed chairman?

COHN: I'm not worried about interest rates right now. I think our interest rate policy is in a good place, I think the consumer is in a good place, and I think the U.S. economy is in a good place. We actually have interest rates at a level right now where activity is growing. I think that, you know, fourth quarter GDP will come in around two, 2.5 percent--

MARGARET BRENNAN: So you--

COHN: --probably 2.5 percent.

MARGARET BRENNAN: --you differ from the president on that quibble about interest rates currently?

COHN: I don't think I differ from the president on the economy being strong.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.

COHN: I think we agree completely about the economy being strong.

MARGARET BRENNAN: But on interest rates--

COHN: Yeah, I agree that I- I think the Fed is in a good place on interest rate policy.

MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about trade. This week, the United States and China, the two largest economies in the world, signed this phase one trade deal. There's like 200 billion in promised purchases, but there are still like 300 billion dollars' worth of goods under tariff. So what does this actually accomplish? What- what do you see it?

COHN: So, first of all, anytime the United States and China get together and sign an agreement, I think we should applaud that. I mean, the mere fact that we got a 90-plus page agreement signed between- between the two countries is very good relative to where we were months ago when everyone thought we were going to continue to feud with China. So we've got some trade agreement in place. The Chinese are going to buy some more goods from the United States, which has to be a good thing. But there's also, in that agreement, there are some provisions that free up trademarks and trade patents and trade secrets, which is very, very good. No, this didn't--

MARGARET BRENNAN: I thought this was about intellectual property--

COHN: This didn't- I said--

MARGARET BRENNAN: --and theft and all of those things?

COHN: This didn't address, look, this--

MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.

COHN: --did not address the big issue. The big issue the president and I agreed upon is that the Chinese had been stealing our intellectual property. They've been infringing on our- our trademarks. They've been infringing on our copyrights. It has not addressed that. And we still have to continue to address that.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you think that China is going to hold up its end of the deal and actually enact some of the reforms they say they're going to carry out?

COHN: I- I think they're going to. I think they're going to open up their markets. I think the Chinese have been close to opening up their markets for the- for the industries that were listed in there. So I'm cautiously optimistic that the Chinese are going to start reforming and opening up their markets.

MARGARET BRENNAN: So you resigned over a difference about tariffs, or at least that was a--

COHN: Yeah, I don't think that's actua- accurate but go ahead.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, then why did you resign?

COHN: Well, look, I- I- I left the administration for a variety of different reasons. And- and the president and I had very open conversations about my policy views and his policy views. We'd accomplished a lot. And at the end of the day, he was going a different direction on some of the trade negotiations than I would have gone. I agreed fundamentally on what the issue was. I just didn't agree on how to solve the issue.

MARGARET BRENNAN: So the steel and aluminum tariffs was what many thought was the impetus for your resignation?

COHN: Well, I didn't think--

MARGARET BRENNAN: You're saying it's not?

COHN: I didn't think the steel and aluminum tariffs were helpful to our economy.

MARGARET BRENNAN: But when it comes to the tariffs that were used to get to the- the negotiating table with China on this deal, or where ultimately they ended up with the free trade deal-  the new NAFTA, so to speak, USMCA. Can the president say, look, people may not like my tactics, but I got this done? Was he ultimately right? Were you wrong?

COHN: They- they can say that. I don't think we would have gotten to a different outcome. I don't think the tariffs helped us get to any different outcome.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Did it hurt the U.S.?

COHN: I think it has hurt the U.S.. I think it's totally hurt the United States. Look, the U.S. economy is very strong, very solid. Employment growth is great. But we're missing a big component. We're missing the capital expenditures from companies in the United States. That was a key component to tax reform.  It was a key component to what we thought would help drive the economy in 2018, 2019, 2020 and on. We put some very stimulative measures into the tax reform--

MARGARET BRENNAN: Lowering the corporate tax rate is what you thought was going to get companies--

COHN: Not--

MARGARET BRENNAN:  --to spend more?

COHN: --not lowering. We actually gave them expensing of CapEx. For the first five years, they can 100 percent expense their CapEx. But the minute you turn around and put steel and aluminum tariffs on them, the minute a company is thinking about spending capital, what do you go out and buy? You go out and buy steel and aluminum. That's how you build factories. That's how you build property-- plant equipment. So all of the sudden, the advantages that we were trying to give companies to help stimulate the economy, to build facilities, to go out and hire people, to drive wages, we took away that advantage by taxing the input that they needed to build.

MARGARET BRENNAN: You're saying the president got in his own way?

COHN: I'm saying the policies collided with each other.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Gary Cohn, stay with us. And we will be right back in a moment.

**COMMERCIAL BREAK**

MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. We continue our conversation with former director of the National Economic Council, Gary Cohn.

So at this signing ceremony the president did this week with China, he said:

**BEGIN VIDEOTAPE**

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I made a lot of bankers look very good.

**END VIDEOTAPE**

MARGARET BRENNAN: The top six U.S. banks saved about 32 billion dollars because of the tax cuts that you helped craft. This is analysis, according to- to Bloomberg News. The- the hit on the tax law is that it is good for corporations, it's good for business. It's not good for the little guy. Why do you think this analysis is wrong? The president seems to be saying and applauding that he's helping out big banks.

COHN: Well, our- our tax bill's clearly working, which is great. We've made U.S. businesses competitive again with the rest of the world. We lowered the corporate tax rate to 21 percent. So we now have a corporate tax rate that is competitive with the rest of the world. Yes, we lowered corporate tax rates, and that in itself cost less than a hundred billion dollars a year to do that. But it stimulates huge economic growth. The businesses in the United States now can thrive, which means that they can grow. They can go out and hire people, which we've seen. We've seen record unemployment. We've seen record unemployment rates down to 3.5 percent. We've seen wage growth. We've seen 3 percent plus wage growth. And most importantly--

MARGARET BRENNAN: You put this all on the tax law?

COHN: We've seen- a lot of it has to do with tax law. It has to. We've seen higher-end wage growth at the bottom pay scale than we have at the top. So we're seeing the incentives that we created in the tax law by lowering the corporate rate, we're seeing that happen, and that is happening in the last couple of years.

MARGARET BRENNAN: There's a whole debate about the contribution to the deficit. But I want to put that aside here because I want to focus in on something--

COHN: Oh, please don't.

MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to focus in on something, though, that- that is really resonating politically. And it is this broader argument that this country somehow is rigged to benefit the wealthy and disadvantage the poor. And you've even had Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JP Morgan, you've had Hank Paulson, former Treasury secretary, former head of Goldman Sachs. I know you know him. They've said that they're all concerned about income inequality growing in this country. Are you concerned?

COHN: Of course I'm concerned.

MARGARET BRENNAN: But you- but you don't-

COHN: We're all concerned-

MARGARET BRENNAN: --think in any way that there have been contributions to that through the tax law you helped write?

COHN: I- I think there's been contributions for the positive. I think if you look at the data, you'll see that we have grown wages at the bottom end of the pay cycle- scale, I'm sorry, pay scale faster than we've grown them at the top. That's exactly what we're trying to do. We're trying to attract more jobs back to the United States, put more people to work. And that's what we're seeing happening.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Michael Bloomberg says about this tax law, nearly all the money goes to people like me who don't need it. This is a guy who knows Wall Street, who is a billionaire. He's saying that the tax law is- is only advantaging people like him.

COHN: I'd love to know how it's advantaging him. I'd love to see that because at the end of the day, we have lowered rates. I'll agree that we've lowered rates. We have broadened the base, meaning that we make more of your income taxable. That's basic tax policy. Lower rates, broaden base, meaning you get rid of more of the loopholes that people have used to deduct from their income what they pay taxes on. We got rid of a lot of the loopholes. So people are having to pay more taxes- they're having to pay tax on more of their income. Yes, they're paying it at a little lower rate.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you going to endorse Michael Bloomberg, whose board I believe you sit on--

COHN: I do not, I do not--

MARGARET BRENNAN: --as part of one of his Bloomberg entities?

COHN: I sit on one of his-- his emerging market boards. I guess it's a board.

MARGARET BRENNAN: But that doesn't mean you're necessarily going to be voting for him?

COHN: It does not.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Two of the candidates who are also vying for the Democratic nomination -- Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren -- constantly come back to this idea of income inequality. They have proposed taxes on billionaires, taxes on financial transactions- Elizabeth Warren has specifically referred to that. People making over 50 million dollars having an additional 2 percent tax. What would the impact of those policies be from your perspective?

COHN: Look, our tax system in the United States is very, very progressive. We have-- over 50 percent of the population today of workers do not pay a dollar of federal income tax. So if you're going to collect more revenue, which I'm not against, we have to collect more revenue, it's going to come from the top half of workers. And in fact, it's going to come from the top 10 percent of workers. That's where-- that's where you can find the taxable income. I think that we will end up doing that. We will potentially need to do that. But these fangled plans that they're coming up with, we don't need to do things like that to collect more income from people. We have a basic tax system that works, and we can do some basic fundamental things, if we need to collect more money. The question is do we need to collect more money? You know, we look at spending and we look at revenue and we don't talk about them in the same sentence. We we collect taxes and then we spend. And Congress never thinks about how much money they have to spend. They just go spend. And so you wouldn't run your household like that. I wouldn't run my household like that. I would decide how much revenue I have and then how much I could spend.

MARGARET BRENNAN: But you're- you're a Democrat.

COHN: Yes, I am.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Is there a single Democrat that you would consider voting for?

COHN: There- there- I- I'll consider voting for anyone. I vote on policy.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Even Elizabeth Warren, whose policy you just tried to--

GARY COHN: I would consider voting for anyone, I said. I didn't say I would. I said I'd consider voting for them.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, that's evasive.

COHN: Yeah.

MARGARET BRENNAN: In pulling apart some of her proposals, you seem to be reflecting a lot of what Wall Street says, which is that there is deep concern over this focus on the financial community, on corporations, etc.. In this environment, is this enough that you see some of the people you know on Wall Street continuing to vote along lines of whatever the president is putting forward, even if they don't like some of his behavior, vote for him because of what he's doing for--

COHN: That's a --

MARGARET BRENNAN: --banks?

COHN: --that's a hypothetical question. I don't know. What I do know--

MARGARET BRENNAN: You don't know who you're voting for?

COHN: --what I do know is the economy is really strong, and the Democrats haven't really come up with an idea of how to help the economy get even stronger. So it's probably easier to talk about corporate greed, and talk about Wall Street, and talk about technology companies because they don't really have an answer for an economy that's growing 2.5 percent with 3.5 percent unemployment and 3 percent wage growth. I haven't heard their answer on that, except let's tax it to death.

MARGARET BRENNAN: So as you said, you identify as a Democrat. You did have disagreements with the president on a number of things. I was there in Trump Tower the day of the Charlottesville reference – "fine people on both sides" -- I remember your face that day and you were very public about some of your differences with the president. Will you vote for him?

COHN: Look, I'm very supportive of the president's economic policy. I'm very supportive of what he's done on deregulation. I haven't heard anyone who's come up with a better policy yet. Now, I just don't vote on the economy. I vote on a lot of the social issues as well. So, you know, in many respects, I've got to balance both sides of that equation before I figure out who I'm gonna vote for.

MARGARET BRENNAN: So you're leaving the door open?

COHN: I'm leaving the door open. But at this point, I don't have any intention not to vote for the president.

MARGARET BRENNAN: You are a frank guy. You're usually pretty direct.

COHN: Yeah.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Is there anyone around the president who can be direct with him right now? Is there anyone doing what you said you did when guiding him on some of these economic policies?

COHN: I don't know. I've been gone a year and a half. I am sure there are people when talking to the president--

MARGARET BRENNAN: But when the president can say, "Look, I've gotten these tariffs that have helped me get this free trade deal with North America. These tariffs have helped me get this Phase 1 deal with China" -- doesn't that encourage the president's approach, one that you have said you have differed with him on?

COHN: It may encourage his approach- but he- he's also got advisors in there that I'm sure are telling him differences. I know that there are people in there- you know, Secretary Mnuchin and I had a lot of conversations where we agreed on tariffs- and I'm sure the secretary is talking to the president about tariffs and what effect they're having and what effect they're not having.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Lastly, I want to ask you about a new book. I know you haven't read it. It's coming out, and there've been excerpts released that directly reference you, which is why I want to give you a chance to respond. He's called the president is- is- in this meeting accused of calling advisers "dopes and babies" and the like. Is the- the description of the president and his management style matching your experience?

COHN: I don't know what book you're referring to. As you said I haven't read it, so I- I- I wouldn't know.

MARGARET BRENNAN: The management style of berating advisors?

COHN: Look, the president is-- what you see on TV is exactly what you get in private with the president. The president is the same person behind closed doors as he is out in public, which is- which is a unique feature. You know, it's not like he turns it on or turns it off when he walks outside. So you've seen everything the president has. That's exactly what you see when you're in a private meeting with him.

MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. Gary Cohn, thank you for your time.

COHN: Thank you.

MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back with our political panel. Stay with us.

Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, once considered a possible Democratic candidate for president, said he is holding off on endorsing any of the current candidates. Bloomberg told "Face the Nation" he believes the way to judge a candidate is by what he or she has done in the past. 

"I want to elect people that have demonstrated ability to do things and a desire that even when it was unpopular, to go and do the right thing," Bloomberg said.

Michael Bloomberg says Trump's words encourage white supremacist violence
Bloomberg said that, for example, on gun reform, he wanted to see what work a candidate had done with Moms Demand Action or have they been working against the NRA. Bloomberg's Everytown for Gun Safety held a forum in Des Moines, Iowa, on Saturday that was attended by most of the Democratic contenders. 

When "Face the Nation" moderator Margaret Brennan asked him when he will make an endorsement, Bloomberg noted there are "15 months" until the election. "Certainly not going to worry about it today," he said. 

Bloomberg also said current frontrunner Joe Biden is "not a lock" for the nomination.

"No, I think — and Joe would certainly tell you — that he's not a lock for the nomination," Bloomberg told "Face the Nation." "There are 20 candidates, of which the majority of them have a really legitimate chance."

Bloomberg said Biden has "great experience" and is a "great American who's worked very hard for the country." But, he said, "there are lots of others who you can say exactly the same thing about."

"Joe's going to have to go out there and earn his spurs as they say and he's going to have to face every issue," Bloomberg said. "All of the Democrats are running against each other for the nomination. They're not running against Donald Trump at the moment, that's for the next election. And I think that they're going to have to make their case why their domestic and foreign policies would be better than the other person's."
