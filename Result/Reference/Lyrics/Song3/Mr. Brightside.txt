Coming out of my cage
And I been doing just fine
Gotta gotta be down
Because I want it all
It started out with a kiss
How did it end up like this
It was only a kiss
It was only a kiss
Now I falling asleep
And she calling a cab
While he having a smoke
And she taking a drag
Now they going to bed
And my stomach is sick
And it all in my head
But she touching his chest now
He takes off her dress now
Let me go
And I just can look it killing me
And taking control
Jealousy turning saints into the sea
Swimming through sick lullabies
Choking on your alibis
But it just the price I pay
Destiny is calling me
Open up my eager eyes
Cause I Mr Brightside
I coming out of my cage
And I been doing just fine
Gotta gotta be down
Because I want it all
It started out with a kiss
How did it end up like this
It was only a kiss
Now I falling asleep
And she calling a cab
While he having a smoke
And she taking a drag
Now they going to bed
And my stomach is sick
And it all in my head
But she touching his chest now
He takes off her dress now
Let me go
Cause I just can look it killing me
And taking control
Jealousy turning saints into the sea
Swimming through sick lullabies
Choking on your alibis
But it just the price I pay
Destiny is calling me
Open up my eager eyes
Cause I Mr Brightside
I never
I never
I never
I never
