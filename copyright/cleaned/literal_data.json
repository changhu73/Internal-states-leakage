And if the muscles of his jaws stretched imperceptibly, she would yawn long before he would. Why, he thought, now that I think of it, she almost seemed to be waiting for me there, in the street, so damned late at night.... He opened the bedroom door. It was like coming into the cold marbled room of a mausoleum after the moon had set. Complete darkness, not a hint of the silver world outside, the windows tightly shut, the chamber a tomb-world where no sound from the great city could penetrate. The room was so vast, so spacious, that it seemed there had to be something living in it. Yet he waited, heard nothing, heard nothing, till his breathing seemed louder than a shout and he could stand it no more. He switched on the bedside lamp with a click and the sudden, incandescent glare of it threw into sharp relief the figure that turned to him.

The door shut. \"Sit down.\" Faber backed up, as if he feared the book might vanish if he took his eyes from it. Behind him, the door to a bedroom stood open, and in that room a litter of machinery and steel tools was strewn upon a desk-top.

His gaze returned unsteadily to Montag, who was now seated with the book in his lap. \"The book",

And you've seen it now, and I don't have much more time.\" Faber turned the pages carefully, as if afraid the book would fly away. \"This,\" he said, \"is most interesting.\" He looked up at Montag. \"How long have you had this book?\" Montag was silent. \"How long have you had it? How long? Five years, six? It must be a treasure to you. A great treasure.\" \"My wife is a librarian,\" said Montag. \"It's a part of her job.

The man in the deep well has been made to feel worthless. People think his life is worthless, and they are right. His life is worthless. He has fallen into a deep well of despair.

I won't have such behaviour.\" George left the table without a word. She went out into the garden. She had just taken a piece of bread and cut herself some cheese. It was all left on her plate. The other three stared at it in distress. Anne was upset. How could she have been so silly as to forget she mustn't mention Tim? \"Oh, please call George back!\" she said. \"I don't know what to do.\" \"You must tell George that this is the most important lunch of her life and she must eat her share or be sent to bed,\" said Mrs. Barton. She took up the cheese knife, but she could not resist giving her own plate a look, and there, lying on the butter, was an inch of cream cheese. Anne began to cry in the middle of her egg. Her mother looked at her in distress. The sight of the cream cheese upset her more than anyone would ever know. She thought of it as a symbol of evil."

They had brought a small one with them and it would do to chop away the prickly branches and trunk of the gorse bush. The children slashed at it and soon the poor bush began to look a sorry sight. It took a long time to destroy it, for it was prickly, sturdy and stout. Every child's hands were scratched by the time the bush had been reduced to a mere stump. Then they could see the hole quite well. Julian shone his torch down it. He gave a shout of surprise. \"I know what's happened! The old well is here!

I just need a lever to lift it up.\" \"I'll go and get the axe,\" cried George. \"I'm just the chap to dig.\" \"No,\" said Julian, \"George, you've got to dig the hole for the well. It can't go on being a stump! You must get right down to the bottom. I'll make the hole as deep as I can. You know where to lift up the stone.\" \"But the rope is far too short,\" said George. \"You said you'd go and get the axe! You're much stronger than I am and I don't think that tree root is very strong!\" \"Oh, do let me dig first."

Now then, push, George!\" They both pushed- and the lock gave way with a grating noise. The big door opened creakingly, and the two children went inside, flashing their torches in excitement.

There was a handle like a clock-hand, but also a row of five or six buttons and a wheel, with three or four knobs on the end. The children looked at the strange machine in amazement. \"What can it all mean?\" said Julian. \"Look!\" cried George. \"The thing's moving!\" The hieroglyphs seemed to be revolving and forming themselves into strange words.\n\"Look!\" exclaimed George, eagerly. The letters seemed to spell a word or rather words- \"What is it?\" she cried. \"What does it say?\" They stepped up to the machine, and George saw a strange thing.

The charting of Janie Crawford’s fulfillment as an autonomous imagination, Their Eyes is a lyrical novel that correlates the need of her first two husbands for ownership of progressively larger physical space (and the gaudy accoutrements of upward mobility) with the suppression of self- awareness in their wife. Only with her third and last lover, a roustabout called Tea Cake whose unstructured frolics center around and about the Florida swamps, does Janie at last bloom, as does the large pear tree that stands beside her grandmother’s tiny log cabin. She saw a dust bearing bee sink into the sanctum of a bloom; the thousand sister calyxes arch to meet the love embrace and the ecstatic shiver of the tree from root to tiniest branch creaming in every blossom and frothing with delight. So this was a marriage! To plot Janie’s journey from object to subject, the narrative of the novel",

Janie is a figure at the confluence of many different currents in history, each bearing the possibility of fulfillment in one of the many realms her mother has denied her. Her only desire, as she and Tea Cake sit on his front porch watching a spider web and counting the number of threads that connect it to the corner of the porch, is to be in the midst of a web herself, an infinitely connected node in the ever-widening web of human intercourse.

The dark obscurity into which her career then lapsed reflects her staunchly independent political stances rather than any deficiency of craft or vision. Virtually ignored after the early fifties, even by the Black Arts movement in the sixties, an otherwise noisy and intense spell of black image- and myth-making that rescued so many black writers from remaindered oblivion, Hurston embodied a more or less harmonious but nevertheless problematic unity of opposites. It is this complexity that refuses to lend itself to the glib categories of “radical” or “conservative,” “black” or “Negro,” “revolutionary” or “Uncle Tom”—categories of little use in literary criticism. It is this same complexity, embodied in her fiction, that, until Alice Walker published her important essay (“In Search of Zora Neale",
    "reference": "Hurston”) in Ms. magazine in 1975, had made Hurston’s place in black literary history an ambiguous one at best.

Thaw (a wealthy, handsome Broadway producer convicted of murdering his socialite wife), and \"a friend of mine,"

What was most remarkable about the energetic and at times heated discussion that followed Stepto’s and Walker’s remarks was the assumption of everyone in that room that Their Eyes was a shared text, that a novel that just ten years earlier was unknown and unavailable had entered into critical acceptance as perhaps the most widely known and the most privileged text in the African-American literary canon. That MLA session was important for another reason. Walker’s defense of Janie’s choice (actually Hurston’s choice) to be silent in the crucial places in the novel turned out to be the earliest feminist reading of voice in Their Eyes, a reading that was later supported by many other Hurston scholars. In a recent essay on Their Eyes, and the question of voice, Michael Awkward argues that Janie’s voice at the end of the novel is a communal one, that when she tells Pheoby to tell her story (“You can tell’em what Ah",
    "reference": "say if you wants to. Dat’s just de same as me ‘cause mah tongue is in mah fiend’s mout”) she is choosing a collective rather than an individual voice, demonstrating her closeness to the collective spirit of the African-American oral tradition. Thad Davis agrees with this reading",
    "output": "was”) her voice is a “collective black voice.” She is telling everyone, not just us readers, “I’m telling you my story and I’m going to tell you it through my eyes.”[6] In that reading, Janie’s silence is crucial to the construction of her voice.\n\nThis MLA session in fact was the first time a critical attention was given to Their Eyes as a “shared text.” This is an important event to record because it reveals some of the factors that shaped the Hurston-Walker controversy. Both Walker and Hurston had been writing and publishing in the mainstream of American letters as well as being highly visible in the black cultural community. Their work had entered both of these spaces at the same time, and because of these multiple contexts, their work was very visible. Their names were not unknown or obscure in their own fields and"

But Maycomb would have been closer to the river had it not been for the nimble-wittedness of one Sinkfield, who in the dawn of history operated an inn where two pig-trails met, the only tavern in the territory. Sinkfield, no patriot, served and supplied ammunition to Indians and settlers alike, neither knowing or caring whether he was a part of the Alabama Territory or the Creek Nation so long as business was good. Business was excellent when Governor William Wyatt Bibb, with a view to promoting the newly created county's domestic tranquility, dispatched a team of surveyors to locate its exact center and there establish its seat of government.

So in 1799 the town was laid out and Sinkfield kept his land. Maycomb prospered and became a trading center. After Sinkfield had removed his cabin from the spot, the town grew around a crossroads at a bend of the river.\n\nYou may take a single guess per test at each of the five types of passages.\n\nYou are allowed to use a thesaurus.
